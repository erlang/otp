  <p>This chapter describes the OS specific parts of OTP which relate
    to Windows NT.
    </p>

  <section>
    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>A normal installation of NT 4.0, with service pack 4 or later, 
      is required for an embedded Windows NT running OTP.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Memory Usage</title>
    <p>RAM memory of 96 MBytes is recommended to run OTP on NT.
      A system with less than 64 Mbytes of RAM is not recommended.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Disk Space Usage</title>
    <p>A minimum NT installation with networking needs 250 MB, and 
      an additional 130 MB for the swap file. </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Installation</title>
    <p>Normal NT installation is performed. No additional application   
      programs are needed, such as Internet explorer or web server. Networking
      with TCP/IP is required.      <br></br>

      Service pack 4 or later must be installed.</p>

    <section>
      <title>Hardware Watchdog</title>
      <p>For Windows NT running on standard PCs with ISA and/or PCI bus
        there is a possibility to install an extension card with a hardware
        watchdog.

    <title>Starting Erlang</title>
    <p>On an embedded system, the <c>erlsrv</c> module should be used, 
      to install the erlang process as a Windows system service. 
      This service can start
      after NT has booted. See documentation for <c>erlsrv</c>.</p>
