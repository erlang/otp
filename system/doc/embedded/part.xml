  <description>
    <p>This manual describes the issues that are specific
      for running Erlang on an embedded system.
      It describes the differences in installing and starting
      Erlang compared to how it is done for a non-embedded system.
      </p>
    <p>Note that this is a supplementary document. You still need to
      read the Installation Guide.
      </p>
    <p>There is also target architecture specific information in
      the top level README file of the Erlang distribution.</p>
