    <p>This section describes the issues that are specific
      for running Erlang on an embedded system.
      It describes the differences in installing and starting
      Erlang compared to how it is done for a non-embedded system.</p>
      <note><p>This is a supplementary section. You also need to
      read Section 1 Installation Guide.</p></note>
    <p>There is also target architecture-specific information in
      the top-level README file of the Erlang distribution.</p>
