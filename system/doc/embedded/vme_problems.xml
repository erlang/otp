    <title>Installation Problems</title>
    <p>The hardware watchdog timer which is controlled by the
      <c>heart</c> port program requires the <c>FORCEvme</c> package,
      which contains the VME bus driver, to be installed. This driver,
      however, might clash with the Sun <c>mcp</c> driver and cause
      the system to completely refuse to boot. To cure this problem,
      the following lines should be added to <c>/etc/system</c>:
      </p>
    <list type="bulleted">
      <item><c>exclude: drv/mcp</c></item>
      <item><c>exclude: drv/mcpzsa</c></item>
      <item><c>exclude: drv/mcpp</c></item>
    </list>
    <warning>
      <p>It is recommended that these lines be added to avoid the
        clash described, which may make it completely impossible to boot
        the system.</p>
