    <title>XNTP for Sunos5</title>
    <p>XNTP maintains a Unix system time-of-day which conforms with
      the Internet standard time servers. XNTP is a complete
      implementation of the Network Time Protocol, version 3
      specification as defined in RFC 1305.
      </p>
    <p>XNTP for use in an <em>embedded system running Sunos5</em> is
      delivered with OTP. The XNTP is delivered as a separate
      <c>tar</c> file which also includes extensive documentation and
      installation instructions.

      <p>The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize the
        time of a computer client or server to another server or
        reference time source, such as a radio or satellite receiver
        or modem. It provides client accuracies typically within a
        millisecond on LANs and up to a few tens of milliseconds on
        WANs relative to a primary server synchronized to Coordinated
        Universal Time (UTC) via a Global Positioning Service (GPS)
        receiver, for example. Typical NTP configurations utilize
        multiple redundant servers and diverse network paths, in order
        to achieve high accuracy and reliability. ...</p>
