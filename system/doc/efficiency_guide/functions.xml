    <title>Pattern matching</title>
    <p>Pattern matching in function head and in <c>case</c> and <c>receive</c>
     clauses are optimized by the compiler. With a few exceptions, there is nothing
     to gain by rearranging clauses.</p>

    <p>One exception is pattern matching of binaries. The compiler
    will not rearrange clauses that match binaries. Placing the
    clause that matches against the empty binary <em>last</em> will usually
    be slightly faster than placing it <em>first</em>.</p>

    <p>Here is a rather contrived example to show another exception:</p>

    <p><em>DO NOT</em></p>
    <code type="erl">
atom_map1(one) -> 1;
atom_map1(two) -> 2;
atom_map1(three) -> 3;
atom_map1(Int) when is_integer(Int) -> Int;
atom_map1(four) -> 4;
atom_map1(five) -> 5;
atom_map1(six) -> 6.</code>

     <p>The problem is the clause with the variable <c>Int</c>.
     Since a variable can match anything, including the atoms
     <c>four</c>, <c>five</c>, and <c>six</c> that the following clauses
     also will match, the compiler must generate sub-optimal code that will
     execute as follows:</p>

     <p>First the input value is compared to <c>one</c>, <c>two</c>, and
     <c>three</c> (using a single instruction that does a binary search;
     thus, quite efficient even if there are many values) to select which
     one of the first three clauses to execute (if any).</p>

     <p>If none of the first three clauses matched, the fourth clause
     will match since a variable always matches. If the guard test
     <c>is_integer(Int)</c> succeeds, the fourth clause will be
     executed.</p>

     <p>If the guard test failed, the input value is compared to
     <c>four</c>, <c>five</c>, and <c>six</c>, and the appropriate clause
     is selected. (There will be a <c>function_clause</c> exception if
     none of the values matched.)</p>

     <p>Rewriting to either</p>

     <p><em>DO</em></p>
     <code type="erl"><![CDATA[
atom_map2(one) -> 1;
atom_map2(two) -> 2;
atom_map2(three) -> 3;
atom_map2(four) -> 4;
atom_map2(five) -> 5;
atom_map2(six) -> 6;
atom_map2(Int) when is_integer(Int) -> Int.]]></code>

     <p>or</p> 

     <p><em>DO</em></p>
     <code type="erl"><![CDATA[
atom_map3(Int) when is_integer(Int) -> Int;
atom_map3(one) -> 1;
atom_map3(two) -> 2;
atom_map3(three) -> 3;
atom_map3(four) -> 4;
atom_map3(five) -> 5;
atom_map3(six) -> 6.]]></code>

     <p>will give slightly more efficient matching code.</p>

     <p>Here is a less contrived example:</p>

     <p><em>DO NOT</em></p>
     <code type="erl"><![CDATA[
map_pairs1(_Map, [], Ys) ->
    Ys;
map_pairs1(_Map, Xs, [] ) ->
    Xs;
map_pairs1(Map, [X|Xs], [Y|Ys]) ->
    [Map(X, Y)|map_pairs1(Map, Xs, Ys)].]]></code>

     <p>The first argument is <em>not</em> a problem. It is variable, but it
     is a variable in all clauses. The problem is the variable in the second
     argument, <c>Xs</c>, in the middle clause. Because the variable can
     match anything, the compiler is not allowed to rearrange the clauses,
     but must generate code that matches them in the order written.</p>

     <p>If the function is rewritten like this</p>

     <p><em>DO</em></p>
     <code type="erl"><![CDATA[
map_pairs2(_Map, [], Ys) ->
    Ys;
map_pairs2(_Map, [_|_]=Xs, [] ) ->
    Xs;
map_pairs2(Map, [X|Xs], [Y|Ys]) ->
    [Map(X, Y)|map_pairs2(Map, Xs, Ys)].]]></code>

    <p>the compiler is free to rearrange the clauses. It will generate code
    similar to this</p>

    <p><em>DO NOT (already done by the compiler)</em></p>
    <code type="erl"><![CDATA[
explicit_map_pairs(Map, Xs0, Ys0) ->
    case Xs0 of
	[X|Xs] ->
	    case Ys0 of
		[Y|Ys] ->
		    [Map(X, Y)|explicit_map_pairs(Map, Xs, Ys)];
		[] ->
		    Xs0
	    end;
	[] ->
	    Ys0
    end.]]></code>
      
    <p>which should be slightly faster for presumably the most common case
    that the input lists are not empty or very short.
    (Another advantage is that Dialyzer is able to deduce a better type
    for the variable <c>Xs</c>.)</p>

  <section>
    <title>Function Calls </title>

    <p>Here is an intentionally rough guide to the relative costs of
    different kinds of calls. It is based on benchmark figures run on
    Solaris/Sparc:</p>

    <list type="bulleted">
    <item>Calls to local or external functions (<c>foo()</c>, <c>m:foo()</c>)
    are the fastest kind of calls.</item>
    <item>Calling or applying a fun (<c>Fun()</c>, <c>apply(Fun, [])</c>)
    is about <em>three times</em> as expensive as calling a local function.</item>
    <item>Applying an exported function (<c>Mod:Name()</c>,
    <c>apply(Mod, Name, [])</c>) is about twice as expensive as calling a fun,
    or about <em>six times</em> as expensive as calling a local function.</item>
    </list>

    <section>
       <title>Notes and implementation details</title>

       <p>Calling and applying a fun does not involve any hash-table lookup.
       A fun contains an (indirect) pointer to the function that implements
       the fun.</p>

       <warning><p><em>Tuples are not fun(s)</em>.
       A "tuple fun", <c>{Module,Function}</c>, is not a fun.
       The cost for calling a "tuple fun" is similar to that
       of <c>apply/3</c> or worse. Using "tuple funs" is <em>strongly discouraged</em>,
       as they may not be supported in a future release,
       and because there exists a superior alternative since the R10B
       release, namely the <c>fun Module:Function/Arity</c> syntax.</p></warning>

       <p><c>apply/3</c> must look up the code for the function to execute
       in a hash table. Therefore, it will always be slower than a
       direct call or a fun call.</p>

       <p>It no longer matters (from a performance point of view)
       whether you write</p>

       <code type="erl">
Module:Function(Arg1, Arg2)</code>

       <p>or</p>

       <code type="erl">
apply(Module, Function, [Arg1,Arg2])</code>

       <p>(The compiler internally rewrites the latter code into the former.)</p>

       <p>The following code</p>

       <code type="erl">
apply(Module, Function, Arguments)</code>

       <p>is slightly slower because the shape of the list of arguments
       is not known at compile time.</p>

  <section>
    <title>Memory usage in recursion</title>
    <p>When writing recursive functions it is preferable to make them
      tail-recursive so that they can execute in constant memory space.</p>
    <p><em>DO</em></p>
    <code type="none">
list_length(List) ->
    list_length(List, 0).

list_length([], AccLen) -> 
    AccLen; % Base case

list_length([_|Tail], AccLen) ->
    list_length(Tail, AccLen + 1). % Tail-recursive</code>
    <p><em>DO NOT</em></p>
    <code type="none">
list_length([]) ->
    0. % Base case
list_length([_ | Tail]) ->
    list_length(Tail) + 1. % Not tail-recursive</code>
