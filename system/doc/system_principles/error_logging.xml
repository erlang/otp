    <title>Error Information From the Runtime System</title>
    <p>Error information from the runtime system, that is, information
      about a process terminating because of an uncaught error exception,
      is by default written to terminal (tty):</p>
    <code type="none"><![CDATA[
=ERROR REPORT==== 9-Dec-2003::13:25:02 ===
Error in process <0.27.0> with exit value: {{badmatch,[1,2,3]},[{m,f,1},{shell,eval_loop,2}]}]]></code>
    <p>The error information is handled by Logger, which is part of
      the Kernel application.</p>
    <p>The exit reasons (such as <c>badarg</c>) used by
      the runtime system are described in
      <seealso marker="doc/reference_manual:errors#exit_reasons">
      Errors and Error Handling</seealso>.</p>
    <p>For information about Logger and its user
      interface, see the
      <seealso marker="kernel:logger">logger(3)</seealso>
      manual page and
      the <seealso marker="kernel:logger_chapter">Logging</seealso>
      section in the Kernel User's Guide. The system can be configured so that
      log events are
      written to file or to tty, or both. In addition, user-defined
      applications can send and format log events using
      Logger.</p>

  <section>
    <title>Log events from OTP behaviours</title>
    <p>The standard behaviours (<c>supervisor</c>, <c>gen_server</c>,
      and so on) send progress and error information to
      Logger. Progress reports are by default not logged, but can be
      enabled by setting the primary log level to <c>info</c>, for
      example by using the Kernel configuration
      parameter <c>logger_level</c>. Supervisor reports, crash reports
      and other error and information reports are by default logged
      through the log handler which is set up when the Kernel
      application is started.</p>
    <p>Prior to Erlang/OTP 21.0, supervisor, crash, and progress
      reports were only logged when the SASL application was
      running. This behaviour can, for backwards compatibility, be
      enabled by setting the Kernel configuration
      parameter <seealso marker="kernel:kernel_app#logger_sasl_compatible">
	<c>logger_sasl_compatible</c></seealso>
      to <c>true</c>. For more information, see
      <seealso marker="sasl:error_logging">SASL Error Logging</seealso>
      in the SASL User's Guide.</p>
