    <title>Error Information From the Runtime System</title>
    <p>Error information from the runtime system, that is, information
      about a process terminating because of an uncaught error exception,
      is by default written to terminal (tty):</p>
    <code type="none"><![CDATA[
=ERROR REPORT==== 9-Dec-2003::13:25:02 ===
Error in process <0.27.0> with exit value: {{badmatch,[1,2,3]},[{m,f,1},{shell,eval_loop,2}]}]]></code>
    <p>The error information is handled by the <em>error logger</em>, a
      system process registered as <c>error_logger</c>. This process
      receives all error messages from the Erlang runtime system as
      well as from the standard behaviours and different Erlang/OTP
      applications.</p>
    <p>The exit reasons (such as <c>badarg</c>) used by
      the runtime system are described in
      <seealso marker="doc/reference_manual:errors#exit_reasons">
      Errors and Error Handling</seealso>.</p>
    <p>For information about the process <c>error_logger</c> and its user
      interface (with the same name), see the
      <seealso marker="kernel:error_logger">error_logger(3)</seealso>
      manual page in Kernel. The system can be configured so that
      error information
      is written to file or to tty, or both. In addition, user-defined
      applications can send and format error information using
      <c>error_logger</c>.</p>

  <section>
    <title>SASL Error Logging</title>
    <p>The standard behaviours (<c>supervisor</c>, <c>gen_server</c>,
      and so on) send progress and error information to <c>error_logger</c>.
      If the SASL application is started, this information is
      written to tty as well. For more information, see
      <seealso marker="sasl:error_logging">SASL Error Logging</seealso>
      in the SASL User's Guide.</p>
