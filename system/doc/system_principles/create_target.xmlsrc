    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>When creating a system using Erlang/OTP, the most simple way is
      to install Erlang/OTP somewhere, install the application specific
      code somewhere else, and then start the Erlang runtime system,
      making sure the code path includes the application specific code.</p>
    <p>Often it is not desirable to use an Erlang/OTP system as is. A
      developer may create new Erlang/OTP compliant applications for a
      particular purpose, and several original Erlang/OTP applications
      may be irrelevant for the purpose in question. Thus, there is a
      need to be able to create a new system based on a given
      Erlang/OTP system, where dispensable applications are removed,
      and a set of new applications are included. Documentation and
      source code is irrelevant and is therefore not included in the
      new system.</p>
    <p>This chapter is about creating such a system, which we call a
      <em>target system</em>.</p>
    <p>In the following sections we consider creating target systems with
      different requirements of functionality:</p>
    <list type="bulleted">
      <item>a <em>basic target system</em> that can be started by
       calling the ordinary <c>erl</c> script, </item>
      <item>a <em>simple target system</em> where also code
       replacement in run-time can be performed, and</item>
      <item>an <em>embedded target system</em> where there is also
       support for logging output from the system to file for later
       inspection, and where the system can be started automatically
       at boot time. </item>
    </list>
    <p>We only consider the case when Erlang/OTP is running on a UNIX
      system.</p>
    <p>In the <c>sasl</c> application there is an example Erlang
      module <c>target_system.erl</c> that contains functions for
      creating and installing a target system.  This module is used in
      the examples below, and the source code of the module is listed
      at the end of this chapter.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Creating a Target System</title>
    <p>It is assumed that you have a working Erlang/OTP system structured
      according to the OTP Design Principles.</p>
    <p><em>Step 1.</em> First create a <c>.rel</c> file (see
      <c>rel(4)</c>) that specifies the <c>erts</c> version
      and lists all applications that should be included in the new
      basic target system. An example is the following
      <c>mysystem.rel</c> file:</p>
    <code type="none">
%% mysystem.rel
{release,
 {"MYSYSTEM", "FIRST"},
 {erts, "5.1"},
 [{kernel, "2.7"},
  {stdlib, "1.10"},
  {sasl, "1.9.3"},
  {pea, "1.0"}]}.    </code>
    <p>The listed applications are not only original Erlang/OTP
      applications but possibly also new applications that you have
      written yourself (here examplified by the application
      <c>pea</c>). </p>
    <p><em>Step 2.</em> From the directory where the <c>mysystem.rel</c>
      file reside, start the Erlang/OTP system:</p>
    <pre>
os> <input>erl -pa /home/user/target_system/myapps/pea-1.0/ebin</input></pre>
    <p>where also the path to the <c>pea-1.0</c> ebin directory is
      provided. </p>
    <p><em>Step 3.</em> Now create the target system: </p>
    <pre>
1> <input>target_system:create("mysystem").</input></pre>
    <p>The <c>target_system:create/1</c> function does the following:</p>
    <list type="ordered">
      <item>Reads the <c>mysystem.rel</c> file, and creates a new file
      <c>plain.rel</c> which is identical to former, except that it
       only lists the <c>kernel</c> and <c>stdlib</c> applications. </item>
      <item>From the <c>mysystem.rel</c> and <c>plain.rel</c> files
       creates the files <c>mysystem.script</c>,
      <c>mysystem.boot</c>, <c>plain.script</c>, and
      <c>plain.boot</c> through a call to
      <c>systools:make_script/2</c>.</item>
      <item>
        <p>Creates the file <c>mysystem.tar.gz</c> by a call to
          <c>systools:make_tar/2</c>. That file has the following
          contents:</p>
        <code type="none">
erts-5.1/bin/
releases/FIRST/start.boot
releases/FIRST/mysystem.rel
releases/mysystem.rel
lib/kernel-2.7/
lib/stdlib-1.10/
lib/sasl-1.9.3/
lib/pea-1.0/        </code>
        <p>The file <c>releases/FIRST/start.boot</c> is a copy of our
          <c>mysystem.boot</c></p>
	<p>The release resource file <c>mysystem.rel</c> is duplicated
          in the tar file. Originally, this file was only stored in
          the <c>releases</c> directory in order to make it possible
          for the <c>release_handler</c> to extract this file
          separately. After unpacking the tar
          file, <c>release_handler</c> would automatically copy the
          file to <c>releases/FIRST</c>. However, sometimes the tar
          file is unpacked without involving
          the <c>release_handler</c> (e.g. when unpacking the first
          target system) and therefore the file is now instead
          duplicated in the tar file so no manual copying is
          necessary.</p>
      </item>
      <item>Creates the temporary directory <c>tmp</c> and extracts the tar file
      <c>mysystem.tar.gz</c> into that directory. </item>
      <item>Deletes the <c>erl</c> and <c>start</c> files from
      <c>tmp/erts-5.1/bin</c>. These files will be created again from
      source when installing the release.</item>
      <item>Creates the directory <c>tmp/bin</c>.</item>
      <item>Copies the previously created file <c>plain.boot</c> to
      <c>tmp/bin/start.boot</c>.</item>
      <item>Copies the files <c>epmd</c>, <c>run_erl</c>, and
      <c>to_erl</c> from the directory <c>tmp/erts-5.1/bin</c> to
       the directory <c>tmp/bin</c>.</item>
      <item>Creates the file <c>tmp/releases/start_erl.data</c> with
       the contents "5.1 FIRST". This file is to be passed as data
       file to the <c>start_erl</c> script.
      </item>
      <item>Recreates the file <c>mysystem.tar.gz</c> from the directories
       in the directory <c>tmp</c>, and removes <c>tmp</c>.</item>
    </list>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Installing a Target System</title>
    <p><em>Step 4.</em> Install the created target system in a
      suitable directory. </p>
    <pre>
2> <input>target_system:install("mysystem", "/usr/local/erl-target").</input></pre>
    <p>The function <c>target_system:install/2</c> does the following:
      </p>
    <list type="ordered">
      <item>Extracts the tar file <c>mysystem.tar.gz</c> into the target
       directory <c>/usr/local/erl-target</c>.</item>
      <item>In the target directory reads the file <c>releases/start_erl.data</c>
       in order to find the Erlang runtime system version ("5.1").</item>
      <item>Substitutes <c>%FINAL_ROOTDIR%</c> and <c>%EMU%</c> for
      <c>/usr/local/erl-target</c> and <c>beam</c>, respectively, in
       the files <c>erl.src</c>, <c>start.src</c>, and
      <c>start_erl.src</c> of the target <c>erts-5.1/bin</c>
       directory, and puts the resulting files <c>erl</c>,
      <c>start</c>, and <c>run_erl</c> in the target <c>bin</c>
       directory.</item>
      <item>Finally the target <c>releases/RELEASES</c> file is created
       from data in the <c>releases/mysystem.rel</c> file.</item>
    </list>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Starting a Target System</title>
    <p>Now we have a target system that can be started in various ways.</p>
    <p>We start it as a <em>basic target system</em> by invoking</p>
    <pre>
os> <input>/usr/local/erl-target/bin/erl</input></pre>
    <p>where only the <c>kernel</c> and <c>stdlib</c> applications are
      started, i.e. the system is started as an ordinary development
      system. There are only two files needed for all this to work:
      <c>bin/erl</c> file (obtained from <c>erts-5.1/bin/erl.src</c>)
      and the <c>bin/start.boot</c> file (a copy of <c>plain.boot</c>).</p>
    <p>We can also start a distributed system (requires <c>bin/epmd</c>).</p>
    <p>To start all applications specified in the original
      <c>mysystem.rel</c> file, use the <c>-boot</c> flag as follows:</p>
    <pre>
os> <input>/usr/local/erl-target/bin/erl -boot /usr/local/erl-target/releases/FIRST/start</input></pre>
    <p>We start a <em>simple target system</em> as above. The only difference
      is that also the file <c>releases/RELEASES</c> is present for
      code replacement in run-time to work.</p>
    <p>To start an <em>embedded target system</em> the shell script
      <c>bin/start</c> is used. That shell script calls
      <c>bin/run_erl</c>, which in turn calls <c>bin/start_erl</c>
      (roughly, <c>start_erl</c> is an embedded variant of
      <c>erl</c>). </p>
    <p>The shell script <c>start</c> is only an example. You should
      edit it to suite your needs. Typically it is executed when the
      UNIX system boots.</p>
    <p><c>run_erl</c> is a wrapper that provides logging of output from
      the run-time system to file. It also provides a simple mechanism
      for attaching to the Erlang shell (<c>to_erl</c>).</p>
    <p><c>start_erl</c> requires the root directory
      (<c>"/usr/local/erl-target"</c>), the releases directory
      (<c>"/usr/local/erl-target/releases"</c>), and the location of
      the <c>start_erl.data</c> file. It reads the run-time system
      version (<c>"5.1"</c>) and release version (<c>"FIRST"</c>) from
      the <c>start_erl.data</c> file, starts the run-time system of the
      version found, and provides <c>-boot</c> flag specifying the boot
      file of the release version found
      (<c>"releases/FIRST/start.boot"</c>).</p>
    <p><c>start_erl</c> also assumes that there is <c>sys.config</c> in
      release version directory (<c>"releases/FIRST/sys.config"</c>). That
      is the topic of the next section (see below).</p>
    <p>The <c>start_erl</c> shell script should normally not be
      altered by the user.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>System Configuration Parameters</title>
    <p>As was pointed out above <c>start_erl</c> requires a
      <c>sys.config</c> in the release version directory
      (<c>"releases/FIRST/sys.config"</c>). If there is no such a
      file, the system start will fail. Hence such a file has to
      be added as well.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>If you have system configuration data that are neither file
      location dependent nor site dependent, it may be convenient to
      create the <c>sys.config</c> early, so that it becomes a part of
      the target system tar file created by
      <c>target_system:create/1</c>. In fact, if you create, in the
      current directory, not only the <c>mysystem.rel</c> file, but
      also a <c>sys.config</c> file, that latter file will be tacitly
      put in the apropriate directory.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Differences from the Install Script</title>
    <p>The above <c>install/2</c> procedure differs somewhat from that
      of the ordinary <c>Install</c> shell script. In fact, <c>create/1</c>
      makes the release package as complete as possible, and leave to the
      <c>install/2</c> procedure to finish by only considering location
      dependent files.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Listing of target_system.erl</title>
    <p>This module can also be found in the <c>examples</c> directory
      of the <c>sasl</c> application.</p>
