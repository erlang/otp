    <p>This section is a quick start tutorial to get you started with Erlang.
      Everything in this section is true, but only part of the truth. For example,
      only the simplest form of the syntax is shown, not all esoteric forms.
      Also, parts that are greatly simplified are indicated with *manual*.
      This means that a lot more information on the subject is to be found in
      the Erlang book or in
      <seealso marker="doc/reference_manual:introduction#erlang ref manual">
      Erlang Reference Manual</seealso>.</p>
