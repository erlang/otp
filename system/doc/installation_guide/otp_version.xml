    <p>As of OTP release 17, the OTP release number corresponds to
    the major part of the OTP version. The OTP version as a concept was
    introduced in OTP 17. In the normal case, the OTP version will be
    constructed as
    <c>&lt;Major&gt;.&lt;Minor&gt;.&lt;Patch&gt;</c> where <c>&lt;Major&gt;</c>
    is the most significant part. However, more dot separated parts than
    this may exist. The dot separated parts consists of integers. If all
    parts less significant than <c>&lt;Minor&gt;</c> equals <c>0</c>, they
    are omitted. The three normal parts
    <c>&lt;Major&gt;.&lt;Minor&gt;.&lt;Patch&gt;</c> will be changed as
    follows:</p>
    <taglist>
      <tag><c>&lt;Major&gt;</c></tag><item>Increased when major changes,
      including incompatibilities, have been made.</item>
      <tag><c>&lt;Minor&gt;</c></tag><item>Increased when new functionality
      has been added.</item>
      <tag><c>&lt;Patch&gt;</c></tag><item>Increased when pure bug fixes
      have been made.</item>
    </taglist>
    <p>When a part in the version number is increased, all less significant
    parts are set to <c>0</c>. Release candidates have an <c>-rc&lt;N&gt;</c>
    suffix. The suffix <c>-rc0</c> will be used during development up to
    the first release candidate.</p>

    <p>OTP of a specific version is a set of applications of
    specific versions. The application versions identified by
    an OTP version corresponds to application versions that
    have been tested together by the Erlang/OTP team at Ericsson AB.
    An OTP system can however be put together with applications from
    different OTP versions. Such a combination of application versions
    has not been tested by the Erlang/OTP team. It is therefore
    <em>always preferred to use OTP applications from one single OTP
    version</em>.</p>

    <p>Application versions will be managed the same way as the OTP version.
    Application versions part of a release candidate will however not have an
    <c>-rc&lt;N&gt;</c> suffix as the OTP version. Also note that a major
    increment in an application version does not necessarily imply a major
    increment of the OTP version. This depends on whether the
    major change in the application is considered as a major change for
    OTP as a whole or not.</p>

    <p>In an OTP source code tree as well as in an installed OTP
    development system, the OTP version can be read from the text
    file <c>OTP_VERSION</c> in the OTP installation root directory
    (<seealso marker="kernel:code#root_dir/0"><c>code:root_dir()</c></seealso>).</p>
    <p>If the version read from the <c>OTP_VERSION</c> file in a
    development system has a <c>**</c> suffix, the system has been
    patched using the <c>$ERL_TOP/otp_build patch_app</c> tool. In
    this case, the system consists of application versions from
    multiple OTP versions. The version preceding the <c>**</c>
    suffix corresponds to the OTP version of the base system that
    has been patched. Note that if a development system is updated by
    other means than <c>$ERL_TOP/otp_build patch_app</c>, the
    <c>OTP_VERSION</c> file may identify wrong OTP version.</p>

    <p>On a target system (see the
    <seealso marker="doc/system_principles:create_target">system principles</seealso>
    documentation) no <c>OTP_VERSION</c> file will exist. This since
    one easily can create a target system where it is hard to even
    determine the base OTP version.</p>
