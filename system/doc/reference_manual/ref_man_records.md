# Records

A record is a data structure for storing a fixed number of elements. It has
named fields and is similar to a struct in C. Record expressions are translated
to tuple expressions during compilation.

More examples are provided in
[Programming Examples](`e:system:prog_ex_records.md`).

## Defining Records

A record definition consists of the name of the record, followed by the field
names of the record. Record and field names must be atoms. Each field can be
given an optional default value. If no default value is supplied, `undefined` is
used.

```erlang
-record(Name, {Field1 [= Expr1],
               ...
               FieldN [= ExprN]}).
```

> #### Change {: .info }
>
> Since OTP 28.0 the record creation syntax is allowed when defining a record:
> ```erlang
> -record #Name{Field1 [= Expr1],
>               ...
>               FieldN [= ExprN]}).
> ```

The default value for a field is an arbitrary expression, except that it must
not use any variables.

A record definition can be placed anywhere among the attributes and function
declarations of a module, but the definition must come before any usage of the
record.

If a record is used in several modules, it is recommended that the record
definition is placed in an include file.

## Creating Records

The following expression creates a new `Name` record where the value of each
field `FieldI` is the value of evaluating the corresponding expression `ExprI`:

```text
#Name{Field1=Expr1, ..., FieldK=ExprK}
```

The fields can be in any order, not necessarily the same order as in the record
definition, and fields can be omitted. Omitted fields get their respective
default value instead.

If several fields are to be assigned the same value, the following construction
can be used:

```text
#Name{Field1=Expr1, ..., FieldK=ExprK, _=ExprL}
```

Omitted fields then get the value of evaluating `ExprL` instead of their default
values. This feature is primarily intended to be used to create patterns for ETS
and Mnesia match functions.

_Example:_

```erlang
-record(person, {name, phone, address}).

lookup(Name, Tab) ->
    ets:match_object(Tab, #person{name=Name, _='_'}).
```

## Accessing Record Fields

```text
Expr#Name.Field
```

Returns the value of the specified field. `Expr` is to evaluate to a `Name`
record.

_Example_:

```erlang
-record(person, {name, phone, address}).

get_person_name(Person) ->
    Person#person.name.
```

The following expression returns the position of the specified field in the
tuple representation of the record:

```text
#Name.Field
```

_Example:_

```erlang
-record(person, {name, phone, address}).

lookup(Name, List) ->
    lists:keyfind(Name, #person.name, List).
```

## Updating Records

```text
Expr#Name{Field1=Expr1, ..., FieldK=ExprK}
```

`Expr` is to evaluate to a `Name` record. A copy of this record is returned,
with the value of each specified field `FieldI` changed to the value of
evaluating the corresponding expression `ExprI`. All other fields retain their
old values.

## Records in Guards

Since record expressions are expanded to tuple expressions, creating
records and accessing record fields are allowed in guards. However,
all subexpressions (for initializing fields), must be valid guard
expressions as well.

_Examples:_

```erlang
handle(Msg, State) when Msg =:= #msg{to=void, no=3} ->
    ...

handle(Msg, State) when State#state.running =:= true ->
    ...
```

There is also a type test BIF [`is_record(Term, RecordTag)`](`is_record/2`).

_Example:_

```erlang
is_person(P) when is_record(P, person) ->
    true;
is_person(_P) ->
    false.
```

## Records in Patterns

A pattern that matches a certain record is created in the same way as a record
is created:

```text
#Name{Field1=Expr1, ..., FieldK=ExprK}
```

In this case, one or more of `Expr1` ... `ExprK` can be unbound variables.

## Nested Records

Assume the following record definitions:

```erlang
-record(nrec0, {name = "nested0"}).
-record(nrec1, {name = "nested1", nrec0=#nrec0{}}).
-record(nrec2, {name = "nested2", nrec1=#nrec1{}}).

N2 = #nrec2{},
```

Accessing or updating nested records can be written without parentheses:

```text
"nested0" = N2#nrec2.nrec1#nrec1.nrec0#nrec0.name,
    N0n = N2#nrec2.nrec1#nrec1.nrec0#nrec0{name = "nested0a"},
```

which is equivalent to:

```text
"nested0" = ((N2#nrec2.nrec1)#nrec1.nrec0)#nrec0.name,
N0n = ((N2#nrec2.nrec1)#nrec1.nrec0)#nrec0{name = "nested0a"},
```

> #### Change {: .info }
>
> Before Erlang/OTP R14, parentheses were necessary when accessing or updating
> nested records.

## Internal Representation of Records

Record expressions are translated to tuple expressions during compilation. A
record defined as:

```erlang
-record(Name, {Field1, ..., FieldN}).
```

is internally represented by the tuple:

```text
{Name, Value1, ..., ValueN}
```

Here each `ValueI` is the default value for `FieldI`.

To each module using records, a pseudo function is added during compilation to
obtain information about records:

```erlang
record_info(fields, Record) -> [Field]
record_info(size, Record) -> Size
```

`Size` is the size of the tuple representation, that is, one more than the
number of fields.

## Record name quoting

A record name is an atom.  Atoms can be quoted.
[Reserved words](reference_manual.md#reserved-words) and variable
names are not atoms, unless quoted.

For example `div` is the integer division operator so it cannot be used
as a record name unless quoted:

``` erlang
-record('div', {field :: integer()}).

foo() -> #'div'{field = 17}.
```

The same applies to a variable name such as `Var`:

``` erlang
-record('Var', {field :: integer()}).

foo() -> #'Var'{field = 4711}.
```

> #### Change {: .info }
>
> Since OTP-28.0, a name after the `#` operator doesn't have to be quoted,
> and since record definition can be done with record creation syntax,
> this also works:
> ``` erlang
> -record #div{field :: integer()}).
> -record #Var{field :: integer()}).
>
> foo() -> #div{field = 17}.
> bar() -> #Var{field = 4711}.
> ```
