  <section><title>Opaque Type Aliases</title>
    <p>The main use case for opacity in Erlang is to hide the implementation of a data type, enabling evolving the API while minimizing the risk of breaking consumers. The runtime does not check opacity. Dialyzer provides some opacity-checking, but the rest is up to convention.
    </p>
    <p>
This document explains what Erlang opacity is (and the trade-offs involved) via the example of OTP's <c>sets:set()</c> data type. This type <em>was</em> defined in `sets` module like this:
    </p>
    <p>
        <code type="erl">-opaque set(Element) :: #set{segs :: segs(Element)}.</code>
            OTP 24  changed the definition to the following, in <url href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/commit/e66941e8d7c47b973dff94c0308ea85a6be1958e">this commit</url>.
        <code type="erl">-opaque set(Element) :: #set{segs :: segs(Element)} | #{Element => ?VALUE}.</code>
<p>And this change was safer and more backwards-compatible than if the type had been defined with <c>-type</c> instead of <c>-opaque</c>. Here's why: when a module defines an <c>-opaque</c>, the contract is that only the defining module should rely on the definition of the type: no other modules should rely on the definition.</p>
<p>This means that code that pattern-matched on <c>set</c> as a record/tuple technically broke the contract, and opted in to being potentially broken when the definition of <c>set()</c> changed. Before OTP 24, this code printed <c>ok</c>. In OTP 24 it may error:</p>
    <code type="erl">
case sets:new() of
    Set when is_tuple(Set) -&gt;
        io:format(&quot;ok&quot;)
end.
    </code>
</p>
<p><strong>When working with an opaque defined in another module, here are some recommendations:</strong></p>

<list type="bulleted">
<item>Don't examine the underlying type using pattern-matching, guards, or functions that reveal the type, such as <c>tuple_size/1</c>.</item>
<item>Instead, use functions provided by the module for working with the type. For example, <c>sets</c> module provides <c>sets:new/0</c>, <c>sets:add/2</c>, <c>sets:is_element/2</c>, etc.</item>
<item><c>sets:set(a)</c> is a subtype of <c>sets:set(a | b)</c> and not the other way around. Generally, you can rely on the property that <c>the_opaque(T)</c> is a subtype of <c>the_opaque(U)</c> when T is a subtype of U.</item>
</list>
<p><strong>When defining your own opaques, here are some recommendations:</strong></p>
<list type="bulleted">
<item>Since consumers are expected to not rely on the definition of the opaque type, you must provide functions for constructing and querying/deconstructing intances of your opaque type. For example, sets can be constructed with <c>sets:new/0</c>, <c>sets:from_list/1</c>, <c>sets:add/2</c>, queried with <c>sets:is_element/2</c>, and deconstructed with <c>sets:to_list/1</c>.</item>
<item>Don't define an opaque with a type variable in parameter position. This breaks the normal and expected behavior that (for example) <c>my_type(a)</c> is a subtype of <c>my_type(a | b)</c></item>
<item>Add <seeguide marker="typespec">specs</seeguide> to exported functions that use the opaque type</item>
</list>
<p>Note that opaques can be harder to work with for consumers, since the consumer is expected not to pattern-match and must instead use functions that the author of the opaque type provides to use instances of the type.</p>
<p>Also, opacity in Erlang is skin-deep: the runtime does not enforce opacity-checking. So now that sets are implemented in terms of maps, an <c>is_map</c> check on a set <em>will</em> pass. The opacity rules are only enforced by convention and by additional tooling such as Dialyzer. And this enforcement is not total: For example, determined consumer of <c>sets</c> can still do things that reveal the structure of the set, such as by printing, serializing, or using a set as <c>term()</c> and then inspecting via functions like <c>is_map</c> or <c>maps:get/2</c>. And Dialyzer must make some <url href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues/5118">approximations</url>. Opacity checking has limitations, but is still a vital tool in scalable Erlang development.</p></section>
