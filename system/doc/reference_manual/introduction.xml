    <title>Purpose</title>
    <p>This reference manual describes the Erlang programming
      language. The focus is on the language itself, not
      the implementation. The language constructs are described in
      text and with examples rather than formally specified, with
      the intention to make the manual more readable.
      The manual is not intended as a tutorial.</p>
    <p>Information about this implementation of Erlang can be found, for
      example, in <em>System Principles</em> (starting and stopping,
      boot scripts, code loading, error logging, creating target
      systems), <em>Efficiency Guide</em> (memory consumption, system
      limits) and <em>ERTS User's Guide</em> (crash dumps, drivers).</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Prerequisites</title>
    <p>It is assumed that the reader has done some programming and
      is familiar with concepts such as data types and programming
      language syntax.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Document Conventions</title>
    <p>In the document, the following terminology is used:</p>
    <list type="bulleted">
      <item>A <em>sequence</em> is one or more items. For example, a
       clause body consists of a sequence of expressions. This
       means that there must be at least one expression.</item>
      <item>A <em>list</em> is any number of items. For example,
       an argument list can consist of zero, one or more arguments.</item>
    </list>
    <p>If a feature has been added recently, in Erlang 5.0/OTP R7 or
      later, this is mentioned in the text.</p>
  </section>

    <title>Complete List of BIFs</title>
    <p>For a complete list of BIFs, their arguments and return values,
      refer to <c>erlang(3)</c>.</p>
