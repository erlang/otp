  <p>This section is the Erlang reference manual. It describes the
    Erlang programming language. </p>

  <section>
    <title>Purpose</title>
    <p>The focus of the Erlang reference manual is on the language itself,
      not the implementation of it. The language constructs are described in
      text and with examples rather than formally specified. This is
      to make the manual more readable.
      The Erlang reference manual is not intended as a tutorial.</p>
    <p>Information about implementation of Erlang can, for example, be found,
      in the following:</p>

  <section>
    <title>Prerequisites</title>
    <p>It is assumed that the reader has done some programming and
      is familiar with concepts such as data types and programming
      language syntax.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Document Conventions</title>
    <p>In this section, the following terminology is used:</p>
    <list type="bulleted">
      <item>A <em>sequence</em> is one or more items. For example, a
       clause body consists of a sequence of expressions. This
       means that there must be at least one expression.</item>
      <item>A <em>list</em> is any number of items. For example,
       an argument list can consist of zero, one, or more arguments.</item>
    </list>
    <p>If a feature has been added recently, in Erlang 5.0/OTP R7 or
      later, this is mentioned in the text.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Complete List of BIFs</title>
    <p>For a complete list of BIFs, their arguments and return values,
      see <seealso marker="erts:erlang#process_flag/2">erlang(3)</seealso>
      manual page in ERTS.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
