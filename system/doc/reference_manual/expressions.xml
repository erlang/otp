  <p>In this chapter, all valid Erlang expressions are listed.
    When writing Erlang programs, it is also allowed to use macro-
    and record expressions. However, these expressions are expanded
    during compilation and are in that sense not true Erlang
    expressions. Macro- and record expressions are covered in
    separate chapters: <seealso marker="macros">Macros</seealso> and
    <seealso marker="records">Records</seealso>.</p>

  <section>
    <title>Expression Evaluation</title>
    <p>All subexpressions are evaluated before an expression itself is
      evaluated, unless explicitly stated otherwise. For example,
      consider the expression:</p>
    <code type="none">
Expr1 + Expr2</code>
    <p><c>Expr1</c> and <c>Expr2</c>, which are also expressions, are
      evaluated first - in any order - before the addition is
      performed.</p>
    <p>Many of the operators can only be applied to arguments of a
      certain type. For example, arithmetic operators can only be
      applied to numbers. An argument of the wrong type will cause
      a <c>badarg</c> run-time error.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <marker id="term"></marker>
    <title>Terms</title>
    <p>The simplest form of expression is a term, that is an integer,
      float, atom, string, list, map or tuple.
      The return value is the term itself.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Variables</title>
    <p>A variable is an expression. If a variable is bound to a value,
      the return value is this value. Unbound variables are only
      allowed in patterns.</p>
    <p>Variables start with an uppercase letter or underscore (_)
      and may contain alphanumeric characters, underscore and @.
      Examples:</p>
    <pre>
X
Name1
PhoneNumber
Phone_number
_
_Height</pre>
    <p>Variables are bound to values using
      <seealso marker="patterns">pattern matching</seealso>. Erlang
      uses <em>single assignment</em>, a variable can only be bound
      once.</p>
    <p>The <em>anonymous variable</em> is denoted by underscore (_) and
      can be used when a variable is required but its value can be
      ignored. Example:</p>
    <pre>
[H|_] = [1,2,3]</pre>
    <p>Variables starting with underscore (_), for example
      <c>_Height</c>, are normal variables, not anonymous. They are
      however ignored by the compiler in the sense that they will not
      generate any warnings for unused variables. Example: The following
      code</p>
    <pre>
member(_, []) ->
    [].</pre>
    <p>can be rewritten to be more readable:</p>
    <pre>
member(Elem, []) ->
    [].</pre>
    <p>This will however cause a warning for an unused variable
      <c>Elem</c>, if the code is compiled with the flag
      <c>warn_unused_vars</c> set. Instead, the code can be rewritten
      to:</p>
    <pre>
member(_Elem, []) ->
    [].</pre>
    <p>Note that since variables starting with an underscore are
      not anonymous, this will match:</p>
    <pre>
{_,_} = {1,2}</pre>
    <p>But this will fail:</p>
    <pre>
{_N,_N} = {1,2}</pre>
    <p>The scope for a variable is its function clause.
      Variables bound in a branch of an <c>if</c>, <c>case</c>, 
      or <c>receive</c> expression must be bound in all branches 
      to have a value outside the expression, otherwise they
      will be regarded as 'unsafe' outside the expression.</p>
    <p>For the <c>try</c> expression introduced in 
      Erlang 5.4/OTP-R10B, variable scoping is limited so that 
      variables bound in the expression are always 'unsafe' outside 
      the expression. This will be improved.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <marker id="pattern"></marker>
    <title>Patterns</title>
    <p>A pattern has the same structure as a term but may contain
      unbound variables. Example:</p>
    <pre>
Name1
[H|T]
{error,Reason}</pre>
    <p>Patterns are allowed in clause heads, <c>case</c> and
      <c>receive</c> expressions, and match expressions.</p>

    <section>
      <title>Match Operator = in Patterns</title>
      <p>If <c>Pattern1</c> and <c>Pattern2</c> are valid patterns,
        then the following is also a valid pattern:</p>
      <pre>
Pattern1 = Pattern2</pre>
      <p>When matched against a term, both <c>Pattern1</c> and
        <c>Pattern2</c> will be matched against the term. The idea
        behind this feature is to avoid reconstruction of terms.
        Example:</p>
      <pre>
f({connect,From,To,Number,Options}, To) ->
    Signal = {connect,From,To,Number,Options},
    ...;
f(Signal, To) ->
    ignore.</pre>
      <p>can instead be written as</p>
      <pre>
f({connect,_,To,_,_} = Signal, To) ->
    ...;
f(Signal, To) ->
    ignore.</pre>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>String Prefix in Patterns</title>
      <p>When matching strings, the following is a valid pattern:</p>
      <pre>
f("prefix" ++ Str) -> ...</pre>
      <p>This is syntactic sugar for the equivalent, but harder to
        read</p>
      <pre>
f([$p,$r,$e,$f,$i,$x | Str]) -> ...</pre>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Expressions in Patterns</title>
      <p>An arithmetic expression can be used within a pattern, if
        it uses only numeric or bitwise operators, and if its value
        can be evaluated to a constant at compile-time. Example:</p>
      <pre>
case {Value, Result} of
    {?THRESHOLD+1, ok} -> ...</pre>
      <p>This feature was added in Erlang 5.0/OTP R7.</p>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Match</title>
    <pre>
Expr1 = Expr2</pre>
    <p>Matches <c>Expr1</c>, a pattern, against <c>Expr2</c>.
      If the matching succeeds, any unbound variable in the pattern
      becomes bound and the value of <c>Expr2</c> is returned.</p>
    <p>If the matching fails, a <c>badmatch</c> run-time error will
      occur.</p>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <pre>
1> <input>{A, B} = {answer, 42}.</input>
{answer,42}
2> <input>A.</input>
answer
3> <input>{C, D} = [1, 2].</input>
** exception error: no match of right hand side value [1,2]</pre>

    <marker id="calls"></marker>
    <title>Function Calls</title>
    <pre>
ExprF(Expr1,...,ExprN)
ExprM:ExprF(Expr1,...,ExprN)</pre>
    <p>In the first form of function calls,
      <c>ExprM:ExprF(Expr1,...,ExprN)</c>, each of <c>ExprM</c> and
      <c>ExprF</c> must be an atom or an expression that evaluates to
      an atom. The function is said to be called by using the
      <em>fully qualified function name</em>. This is often referred
      to as a <em>remote</em> or <em>external function call</em>.
      Example:</p>
    <code type="none">
lists:keysearch(Name, 1, List)</code>
    <p>In the second form of function calls,
      <c>ExprF(Expr1,...,ExprN)</c>, <c>ExprF</c> must be an atom or
      evaluate to a fun.</p>

    <p>If <c>ExprF</c> is an atom the function is said to be called by
      using the <em>implicitly qualified function name</em>.  If the
      function <c>ExprF</c> is locally defined, it is called.
      Alternatively if <c>ExprF</c> is explicitly imported from module
      <c>M</c>, <c>M:ExprF(Expr1,...,ExprN)</c> is called. If
      <c>ExprF</c> is neither declared locally nor explicitly
      imported, <c>ExprF</c> must be the name of an automatically
      imported BIF. Examples:</p>

    <code type="none">
handle(Msg, State)
spawn(m, init, [])</code>
    <p>Examples where ExprF is a fun:</p>
    <code type="none">
Fun1 = fun(X) -> X+1 end
Fun1(3)
=> 4

fun lists:append/2([1,2], [3,4])
=> [1,2,3,4]</code>

    <p>Note that when calling a local function, there is a difference
    between using the implicitly or fully qualified function name, as
    the latter always refers to the latest version of the module. See
    <seealso marker="code_loading">Compilation and Code Loading</seealso>.</p>

    <p>See also the chapter about
      <seealso marker="functions#eval">Function Evaluation</seealso>.</p>

    <section>
      <title>Local Function Names Clashing With  Auto-imported BIFs</title>
    <p>If a local function has the same name as an auto-imported BIF,
    the semantics is that implicitly qualified function calls are
    directed to the locally defined function, not to the BIF. To avoid
    confusion, there is a compiler directive available,
    <c>-compile({no_auto_import,[F/A]})</c>, that makes a BIF not
    being auto-imported. In certain situations, such a compile-directive
    is mandatory.</p>

    <warning><p>Before OTP R14A (ERTS version 5.8), an implicitly
    qualified function call to a function having the same name as an
    auto-imported BIF always resulted in the BIF being called. In
    newer versions of the compiler the local function is instead
    called. The change is there to avoid that future additions to the
    set of auto-imported BIFs does not silently change the behavior
    of old code.</p>

    <p>However, to avoid that old (pre R14) code changed its
    behavior when compiled with OTP version R14A or later, the
    following restriction applies: If you override the name of a BIF
    that was auto-imported in OTP versions prior to R14A (ERTS version
    5.8) and have an implicitly qualified call to that function in
    your code, you either need to explicitly remove the auto-import
    using a compiler directive, or replace the call with a fully
    qualified function call, otherwise you will get a compilation
    error. See example below:</p> </warning>

    <code type="none">
-export([length/1,f/1]).

-compile({no_auto_import,[length/1]}). % erlang:length/1 no longer autoimported

length([]) ->
    0;
length([H|T]) ->
    1 + length(T). %% Calls the local function length/1

f(X) when erlang:length(X) > 3 -> %% Calls erlang:length/1,
                                  %% which is allowed in guards
    long.</code>

    <p>The same logic applies to explicitly imported functions from
    other modules as to locally defined functions. To both import a
    function from another module and have the function declared in the
    module at the same time is not allowed.</p>

    <code type="none">
-export([f/1]).

-compile({no_auto_import,[length/1]}). % erlang:length/1 no longer autoimported

-import(mod,[length/1]).

f(X) when erlang:length(X) > 33 -> %% Calls erlang:length/1,
                                   %% which is allowed in guards

    erlang:length(X);              %% Explicit call to erlang:length in body

f(X) ->
    length(X).                     %% mod:length/1 is called</code>


    <p>For auto-imported BIFs added to Erlang in release R14A and thereafter,
    overriding the name with a local function or explicit import is always
    allowed. However, if the <c>-compile({no_auto_import,[F/A])</c>
    directive is not used, the compiler will issue a warning whenever
    the function is called in the module using the implicitly qualified
    function name.</p>

    <title>If</title>
    <pre>
if
    GuardSeq1 ->
        Body1;
    ...;
    GuardSeqN ->
        BodyN
end</pre>
    <p>The branches of an <c>if</c>-expression are scanned sequentially
      until a guard sequence <c>GuardSeq</c> which evaluates to true is
      found. Then the corresponding <c>Body</c> (sequence of expressions
      separated by ',') is evaluated.</p>
    <p>The return value of <c>Body</c> is the return value of
      the <c>if</c> expression.</p>
    <p>If no guard sequence is true, an <c>if_clause</c> run-time error
      will occur. If necessary, the guard expression <c>true</c> can be
      used in the last branch, as that guard sequence is always true.</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre>
is_greater_than(X, Y) ->
    if
        X>Y ->
            true;
        true -> % works as an 'else' branch
            false
    end</pre>

    <title>Case</title>

case Expr of
    Pattern1 [when GuardSeq1] ->
        Body1;
    ...;
    PatternN [when GuardSeqN] ->
        BodyN
end</pre>
    <p>The expression <c>Expr</c> is evaluated and the patterns
      <c>Pattern</c> are sequentially matched against the result. If a
      match succeeds and the optional guard sequence <c>GuardSeq</c> is
      true, the corresponding <c>Body</c> is evaluated.</p>
    <p>The return value of <c>Body</c> is the return value of
      the <c>case</c> expression.</p>
    <p>If there is no matching pattern with a true guard sequence,
      a <c>case_clause</c> run-time error will occur.</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre>
is_valid_signal(Signal) ->
    case Signal of
        {signal, _What, _From, _To} ->
            true;
        {signal, _What, _To} ->
            true;
        _Else ->

Expr1 ! Expr2</pre>
    <p>Sends the value of <c>Expr2</c> as a message to the process
      specified by <c>Expr1</c>. The value of <c>Expr2</c> is also
      the return value of the expression.</p>
    <p><c>Expr1</c> must evaluate to a pid, a registered name (atom) or
      a tuple <c>{Name,Node}</c>, where <c>Name</c> is an atom and
      <c>Node</c> a node name, also an atom.</p>
    <list type="bulleted">
      <item>If <c>Expr1</c> evaluates to a name, but this name is not

      <item>Sending a message to a pid never fails, even if the pid
       identifies a non-existing process.</item>
      <item>Distributed message sending, that is if <c>Expr1</c>
       evaluates to a tuple <c>{Name,Node}</c> (or a pid located at
       another node), also never fails.</item>

    <title>Receive</title>
    <pre>
receive
    Pattern1 [when GuardSeq1] ->

    ...;
    PatternN [when GuardSeqN] ->
        BodyN
end</pre>
    <p>Receives messages sent to the process using the send operator
      (!). The patterns <c>Pattern</c> are sequentially matched
      against the first message in time order in the mailbox, then
      the second, and so on. If a match succeeds and the optional
      guard sequence <c>GuardSeq</c> is true, the corresponding
      <c>Body</c> is evaluated. The matching message is consumed, that
      is removed from the mailbox, while any other messages in
      the mailbox remain unchanged.</p>
    <p>The return value of <c>Body</c> is the return value of
      the <c>receive</c> expression.</p>
    <p><c>receive</c> never fails. Execution is suspended, possibly
      indefinitely, until a message arrives that does match one of
      the patterns and with a true guard sequence. </p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre>
wait_for_onhook() ->
    receive
        onhook ->
            disconnect(),
            idle();
        {connect, B} ->
            B ! {busy, self()},
            wait_for_onhook()
    end.</pre>
    <p>It is possible to augment the <c>receive</c> expression with a
      timeout:</p>
    <pre>
receive
    Pattern1 [when GuardSeq1] ->
        Body1;
    ...;
    PatternN [when GuardSeqN] ->
        BodyN
after
    ExprT ->
        BodyT
end</pre>
    <p><c>ExprT</c> should evaluate to an integer. The highest allowed
      value is 16#ffffffff, that is, the value must fit in 32 bits.
      <c>receive..after</c> works exactly as <c>receive</c>, except
      that if no matching message has arrived within <c>ExprT</c>
      milliseconds, then <c>BodyT</c> is evaluated instead and its
      return value becomes the return value of the <c>receive..after</c>
      expression.</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre>
wait_for_onhook() ->
    receive
        onhook ->
            disconnect(),
            idle();
        {connect, B} ->
            B ! {busy, self()},
            wait_for_onhook()
    after
        60000 ->
            disconnect(),
            error()
    end.</pre>
    <p>It is legal to use a <c>receive..after</c> expression with no
      branches:</p>
    <pre>
receive
after
    ExprT ->
        BodyT
end</pre>
    <p>This construction will not consume any messages, only suspend
      execution in the process for <c>ExprT</c> milliseconds and can be
      used to implement simple timers.</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre>
timer() ->
    spawn(m, timer, [self()]).

timer(Pid) ->
    receive
    after
        5000 ->
            Pid ! timeout
    end.</pre>
    <p>There are two special cases for the timeout value <c>ExprT</c>:</p>
    <taglist>
      <tag><c>infinity</c></tag>
      <item>The process should wait indefinitely for a matching message
       -- this is the same as not using a timeout. Can be
       useful for timeout values that are calculated at run-time.</item>
      <tag>0</tag>
      <item>If there is no matching message in the mailbox, the timeout
       will occur immediately.</item>

    <p>The arguments may be of different data types. The following
      order is defined:</p>
    <pre>
number &lt; atom &lt; reference &lt; fun &lt; port &lt; pid &lt; tuple &lt; list &lt; bit string</pre>
    <p>Lists are compared element by element. Tuples are ordered by
      size, two tuples with the same size are compared element by
      element.</p>
      <p>When comparing an integer to a float, the term with the lesser
      precision will be converted into the other term's type, unless the
      operator is one of =:= or =/=. A float is more precise than
      an integer until all significant figures of the float are to the left of
      the decimal point. This happens when the float is larger/smaller than
      +/-9007199254740992.0. The conversion strategy is changed
      depending on the size of the float because otherwise comparison of large
      floats and integers would lose their transitivity.</p>

    <p>Returns the Boolean value of the expression, <c>true</c> or
      <c>false</c>.</p>

    <title>Short-Circuit Expressions</title>
    <pre>
Expr1 orelse Expr2
Expr1 andalso Expr2</pre>
    <p>Expressions where <c>Expr2</c> is evaluated only if
      necessary. That is, <c>Expr2</c> is evaluated only if <c>Expr1</c>
      evaluates to <c>false</c> in an <c>orelse</c> expression, or only
      if <c>Expr1</c> evaluates to <c>true</c> in an <c>andalso</c>
      expression. Returns either the value of <c>Expr1</c> (that is,
      <c>true</c> or <c>false</c>) or the value of <c>Expr2</c>
      (if <c>Expr2</c> was evaluated).</p>

    <p>Example 1:</p>
    <pre>
case A >= -1.0 andalso math:sqrt(A+1) > B of</pre>
    <p>This will work even if <c>A</c> is less than <c>-1.0</c>,
      since in that case, <c>math:sqrt/1</c> is never evaluated.</p>
    <p>Example 2:</p>
    <pre>
OnlyOne = is_atom(L) orelse
         (is_list(L) andalso length(L) == 1),</pre>

    <p>From R13A, <c>Expr2</c> is no longer required to evaluate to a
    boolean value. As a consequence, <c>andalso</c> and <c>orelse</c>
    are now tail-recursive.  For instance, the following function is
    tail-recursive in R13A and later:</p>

    <pre>
all(Pred, [Hd|Tail]) ->
    Pred(Hd) andalso all(Pred, Tail);
all(_, []) ->
    true.</pre>

    <title>List Operations</title>
    <pre>
Expr1 ++ Expr2
Expr1 -- Expr2</pre>
    <p>The list concatenation operator <c>++</c> appends its second
      argument to its first and returns the resulting list.</p>
    <p>The list subtraction operator <c>--</c> produces a list which
      is a copy of the first argument, subjected to the following
      procedure: for each element in the second argument, the first
      occurrence of this element (if any) is removed.</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre>
1> <input>[1,2,3]++[4,5].</input>
[1,2,3,4,5]
2> <input>[1,2,3,2,1,2]--[2,1,2].</input>
[3,1,2]</pre>

     <warning><p>The complexity of <c>A -- B</c> is
     proportional to <c>length(A)*length(B)</c>, meaning that it
     will be very slow if both <c>A</c> and <c>B</c> are
     long lists.</p></warning>

	<title>Map Expressions</title>
	  <section>
	  <title>Creating Maps</title>
	  <p>
		  Constructing a new map is done by letting an expression <c>K</c> be associated with
		  another expression <c>V</c>:
	  </p>
	  <code>#{ K => V }</code>
	  <p>
		  New maps may include multiple associations at construction by listing every
		  association:
	  </p>
	  <code>#{ K1 => V1, .., Kn => Vn }</code>
	  <p>
		  An empty map is constructed by not associating any terms with each other:
	  </p>
	  <code>#{}</code>
	  <p>
		  All keys and values in the map are terms. Any expression is first evaluated and
		  then the resulting terms are used as <em>key</em> and <em>value</em> respectively.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  Keys and values are separated by the <c>=></c> arrow and associations are
		  separated by <c>,</c>.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		  Examples:
	  </p>
	  <code>
M0 = #{},                 % empty map
M1 = #{a => &lt;&lt;"hello"&gt;&gt;}, % single association with literals
M2 = #{1 => 2, b => b},   % multiple associations with literals
M3 = #{k => {A,B}},       % single association with variables
M4 = #{{"w", 1} => f()}.  % compound key associated with an evaluated expression</code>
	  <p>
		  where, <c>A</c> and <c>B</c> are any expressions and <c>M0</c> through <c>M4</c>
		  are the resulting map terms.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  If two matching keys are declared, the latter key will take precedence.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  Example:
	  </p>

<pre>
1> <input>#{1 => a, 1 => b}.</input>
#{1 => b }
2> <input>#{1.0 => a, 1 => b}.</input>
#{1 => b, 1.0 => a}
</pre>
	  <p>
		  The order in which the expressions constructing the keys and their
		  associated values are evaluated is not defined. The syntactic order of
		  the key-value pairs in the construction is of no relevance, except in
		  the above mentioned case of two matching keys.
	  </p>
  </section>

  <section>
	  <title>Updating Maps</title>
	  <p>
		  Updating a map has similar syntax as constructing it.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  An expression defining the map to be updated is put in front of the expression
		  defining the keys to be updated and their respective values.
	  </p>
	  <code>M#{ K => V }</code>
	  <p>
		  where <c>M</c> is a term of type map and <c>K</c> and <c>V</c> are any expression.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  If key <c>K</c> does not match any existing key in the map, a new association
		  will be created from key <c>K</c> to value <c>V</c>.  If key <c>K</c> matches
		  an existing key in map <c>M</c> its associated value will be replaced by the
		  new value <c>V</c>. In both cases the evaluated map expression will return a new map.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  If <c>M</c> is not of type map an exception of type <c>badmap</c> is thrown.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  To only update an existing value, the following syntax is used,
	  </p>
	  <code>M#{ K := V } </code>
	  <p>
		  where <c>M</c> is an term of type map, <c>V</c> is an expression and <c>K</c>
		  is an expression which evaluates to an existing key in <c>M</c>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  If key <c>K</c> does not match any existing keys in map <c>M</c> an exception
		  of type <c>badarg</c> will be triggered at runtime. If a matching key <c>K</c>
		  is present in map <c>M</c> its associated value will be replaced by the new
		  value <c>V</c> and the evaluated map expression returns a new map.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  If <c>M</c> is not of type map an exception of type <c>badmap</c> is thrown.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  Examples:
	  </p>
	  <code>
M0 = #{},
M1 = M0#{a => 0},
M2 = M1#{a => 1, b => 2},
M3 = M2#{"function" => fun() -> f() end},
M4 = M3#{a := 2, b := 3}.  % 'a' and 'b' was added in `M1` and `M2`.</code>
	  <p>
		  where <c>M0</c> is any map. It follows that <c>M1 .. M4</c> are maps as well.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  More Examples:
	  </p>
<pre>
1> <input>M = #{1 => a}.</input>
#{1 => a }
2> <input>M#{1.0 => b}.</input>
#{1 => a, 1.0 => b}.
3> <input>M#{1 := b}.</input>
#{1 => b}
4> <input>M#{1.0 := b}.</input>
** exception error: bad argument
</pre>
	  <p>
		  As in construction, the order in which the key and value expressions
		  are evaluated is not defined. The
		  syntactic order of the key-value pairs in the update is of no
		  relevance, except in the case where two keys match, in which
		  case the latter value is used.
	  </p>
  </section>

  <section>
	  <title>Maps in Patterns</title>
	  <p>
		  Matching of key-value associations from maps is done in the following way:
	  </p>

	  <code>#{ K := V } = M</code>
	  <p>
		  where <c>M</c> is any map. The key <c>K</c> has to be an expression with bound
		  variables or a literals, and <c>V</c> can be any pattern with either bound or
		  unbound variables.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  If the variable <c>V</c> is unbound, it will be bound to the value associated
		  with the key <c>K</c>, which has to exist in the map <c>M</c>. If the variable
		  <c>V</c> is bound, it has to match the value associated with <c>K</c> in <c>M</c>.
	  </p>
	  <p> Example: </p>
<code>
1> <input>M = #{"tuple" => {1,2}}.</input>
#{"tuple" => {1,2}}
2> <input>#{"tuple" := {1,B}} = M.</input>
#{"tuple" => {1,2}}
3> <input>B.</input>
2.</code>
	  <p>
		  This will bind variable <c>B</c> to integer <c>2</c>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  Similarly, multiple values from the map may be matched:
	  </p>
	  <code>#{ K1 := V1, .., Kn := Vn } = M</code>
	  <p>
		  where keys <c>K1 .. Kn</c> are any expressions with literals or bound variables. If all
		  keys exist in map <c>M</c> all variables in <c>V1 .. Vn</c> will be matched to the
		  associated values of their respective keys.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  If the matching conditions are not met, the match will fail, either with
	  </p>
	  <list>
		  <item>
			  a <c>badmatch</c> exception, if used in the context of the matching operator
			  as in the example,
		  </item>
		  <item>
			  or resulting in the next clause being tested in function heads and
			  case expressions.
		  </item>
	  </list>
	  <p>
		  Matching in maps only allows for <c>:=</c> as delimiters of associations.
		  The order in which keys are declared in matching has no relevance.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  Duplicate keys are allowed in matching and will match each pattern associated
		  to the keys.
	  </p>
	  <code>#{ K := V1, K := V2 } = M</code>
	  <p>
		  Matching an expression against an empty map literal will match its type but
		  no variables will be bound:
	  </p>
	  <code>#{} = Expr</code>
	  <p>
		  This expression will match if the expression <c>Expr</c> is of type map, otherwise
		  it will fail with an exception <c>badmatch</c>.
	  </p>
	  <section>
		  <title>Matching syntax: Example with literals in function heads</title>
		  <p>
			  Matching of literals as keys are allowed in function heads.

		  <code>

    <title>Bit Syntax Expressions</title>
    <code type="none"><![CDATA[<<>>
<<E1,...,En>>]]></code>
    <p>Each element <c>Ei</c> specifies a <em>segment</em> of
      the bit string. Each element <c>Ei</c> is a value, followed by an
      optional <em>size expression</em> and an optional <em>type specifier list</em>.</p>
    <pre>
Ei = Value |
     Value:Size |
     Value/TypeSpecifierList |
     Value:Size/TypeSpecifierList</pre>
    <p>Used in a bit string construction, <c>Value</c> is an expression
    which should evaluate to an integer, float or bit string.  If the
    expression is something else than a single literal or variable, it
    should be enclosed in parenthesis.</p>

    <p>Used in a bit string matching, <c>Value</c> must be a variable,
    or an integer, float or string.</p>

    <p>Note that, for example, using a string literal as in
    <c><![CDATA[<<"abc">>]]></c> is syntactic sugar for
    <c><![CDATA[<<$a,$b,$c>>]]></c>.</p>

    <p>Used in a bit string construction, <c>Size</c> is an expression
    which should evaluate to an integer.</p>
    
    <p>Used in a bit string matching, <c>Size</c> must be an integer or a 
    variable bound to an integer.</p>

    <p>The value of <c>Size</c> specifies the size of the segment in
    units (see below). The default value depends on the type (see
    below). For <c>integer</c> it is 8, for
    <c>float</c> it is 64, for <c>binary</c> and <c>bitstring</c> it is
    the whole binary or bit string. In matching, this default value is only
    valid for the very last element. All other bit string or binary 
    elements in the matching must have a size specification.</p>

    <p>For the <c>utf8</c>, <c>utf16</c>, and <c>utf32</c> types,
    <c>Size</c> must not be given. The size of the segment is implicitly
    determined by the type and value itself.</p>
    
    <p><c>TypeSpecifierList</c> is a list of type specifiers, in any
    order, separated by hyphens (-). Default values are used for any
    omitted type specifiers.</p>
    <taglist>
      <tag><c>Type</c>= <c>integer</c> | <c>float</c> | <c>binary</c> |
             <c>bytes</c> | <c>bitstring</c> | <c>bits</c> |
	     <c>utf8</c> | <c>utf16</c> | <c>utf32</c> </tag>
      <item>The default is <c>integer</c>. <c>bytes</c> is a shorthand for 
      <c>binary</c> and <c>bits</c> is a shorthand for <c>bitstring</c>.
      See below for more information about the <c>utf</c> types.
      </item>

      <tag><c>Signedness</c>= <c>signed</c> | <c>unsigned</c></tag>
      <item>Only matters for matching and when the type is <c>integer</c>. 
      The default is <c>unsigned</c>.</item>

      <tag><c>Endianness</c>= <c>big</c> | <c>little</c> | <c>native</c></tag>
      <item>Native-endian means that the endianness will be resolved at load
       time to be either big-endian or little-endian, depending on
       what is native for the CPU that the Erlang machine is run on.
       Endianness only matters when the Type is either <c>integer</c>,
       <c>utf16</c>, <c>utf32</c>, or <c>float</c>. The default is <c>big</c>.
       </item>

      <tag><c>Unit</c>= <c>unit:IntegerLiteral</c></tag>
      <item>The allowed range is 1..256. Defaults to 1 for <c>integer</c>,
       <c>float</c> and <c>bitstring</c>, and to 8 for <c>binary</c>.
       No unit specifier must be given for the types 
       <c>utf8</c>, <c>utf16</c>, and <c>utf32</c>.
       </item>
    </taglist>
    <p>The value of <c>Size</c> multiplied with the unit gives
      the number of bits. A segment of type <c>binary</c> must have 
      a size that is evenly divisible by 8.</p>

    <note><p>When constructing binaries, if the size <c>N</c> of an integer
    segment is too small to contain the given integer, the most significant
    bits of the integer will be silently discarded and only the <c>N</c> least
    significant bits will be put into the binary.</p></note>

    <p>The types <c>utf8</c>, <c>utf16</c>, and <c>utf32</c> specifies
    encoding/decoding of the <em>Unicode Transformation Format</em>s UTF-8, UTF-16,
    and UTF-32, respectively.</p>

    <p>When constructing a segment of a <c>utf</c> type, <c>Value</c>
    must be an integer in the range 0..16#D7FF or
    16#E000....16#10FFFF. Construction
    will fail with a <c>badarg</c> exception if <c>Value</c> is
    outside the allowed ranges. The size of the resulting binary
    segment depends on the type and/or <c>Value</c>. For <c>utf8</c>,
    <c>Value</c> will be encoded in 1 through 4 bytes. For
    <c>utf16</c>, <c>Value</c> will be encoded in 2 or 4
    bytes. Finally, for <c>utf32</c>, <c>Value</c> will always be
    encoded in 4 bytes.</p>

    <p>When constructing, a literal string may be given followed
    by one of the UTF types, for example: <c><![CDATA[<<"abc"/utf8>>]]></c>
    which is syntatic sugar for 
    <c><![CDATA[<<$a/utf8,$b/utf8,$c/utf8>>]]></c>.</p>

    <p>A successful match of a segment of a <c>utf</c> type results
    in an integer in the range 0..16#D7FF or  16#E000..16#10FFFF.
    The match will fail if returned value
    would fall outside those ranges.</p>

    <p>A segment of type <c>utf8</c> will match 1 to 4 bytes in the binary,
    if the binary at the match position contains a valid UTF-8 sequence.
    (See RFC-3629 or the Unicode standard.)</p>

    <p>A segment of type <c>utf16</c> may match 2 or 4 bytes in the binary.
    The match will fail if the binary at the match position does not contain
    a legal UTF-16 encoding of a Unicode code point. (See RFC-2781 or
    the Unicode standard.)</p>

    <p>A segment of type <c>utf32</c> may match 4 bytes in the binary in the
    same way as an <c>integer</c> segment matching 32 bits.
    The match will fail if the resulting integer is outside the legal ranges
    mentioned above.</p>

    <p>Examples:</p>
    <pre>

</pre>
    <p>Note that bit string patterns cannot be nested.</p>
    <p>Note also that "<c><![CDATA[B=<<1>>]]></c>" is interpreted as
      "<c><![CDATA[B =<<1>>]]></c>" which is a syntax error. The correct way is

    <p>A fun expression begins with the keyword <c>fun</c> and ends
      with the keyword <c>end</c>. Between them should be a function
      declaration, similar to a
      <seealso marker="functions#syntax">regular function declaration</seealso>,
      except that the function name is optional and should be a variable if
      any.</p>
    <p>Variables in a fun head shadow the function name and both shadow
      variables in the function clause surrounding the fun expression, and
      variables bound in a fun body are local to the fun body.</p>
    <p>The return value of the expression is the resulting fun.</p>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <pre>
1> <input>Fun1 = fun (X) -> X+1 end.</input>
#Fun&lt;erl_eval.6.39074546&gt;
2> <input>Fun1(2).</input>

    <p>The following fun expressions are also allowed:</p>

fun Name/Arity
fun Module:Name/Arity</pre>
    <p>In <c>Name/Arity</c>, <c>Name</c> is an atom and <c>Arity</c> is an integer.
      <c>Name/Arity</c> must specify an existing local function. The expression is
      syntactic sugar for:</p>
    <pre>
fun (Arg1,...,ArgN) -> Name(Arg1,...,ArgN) end</pre>
    <p>In <c>Module:Name/Arity</c>, <c>Module</c> and <c>Name</c> are atoms
      and <c>Arity</c> is an integer. Starting from the R15 release,
      <c>Module</c>, <c>Name</c>, and <c>Arity</c> may also be variables.
      A fun defined in this way will refer to the function <c>Name</c>
      with arity <c>Arity</c> in the <em>latest</em> version of module
      <c>Module</c>. A fun defined in this way will not be dependent on

    <p>Returns the value of <c>Expr</c> unless an exception

    <p>This is an enhancement of
      <seealso marker="#catch">catch</seealso> that appeared in
      Erlang 5.4/OTP-R10B. It gives the possibility do distinguish

      the desired ones, passing the others on to an enclosing
      <c>try</c> or <c>catch</c> or to default error handling.</p>
    <p>Note that although the keyword <c>catch</c> is used in
      the <c>try</c> expression, there is not a <c>catch</c> expression
      within the <c>try</c> expression.</p>
    <p>Returns the value of <c>Exprs</c> (a sequence of expressions
      <c>Expr1, ..., ExprN</c>) unless an exception occurs during
      the evaluation. In that case the exception is caught and
      the patterns <c>ExceptionPattern</c> with the right exception
      class <c>Class</c> are sequentially matched against the caught
      exception. An omitted <c>Class</c> is shorthand for <c>throw</c>.
      If a match succeeds and the optional guard sequence
      <c>ExceptionGuardSeq</c> is true, the corresponding
      <c>ExceptionBody</c> is evaluated to become the return value.</p>
    <p>If an exception occurs during evaluation of <c>Exprs</c> but
      there is no matching <c>ExceptionPattern</c> of the right
      <c>Class</c> with a true guard sequence, the exception is passed
      on as if <c>Exprs</c> had not been enclosed in a <c>try</c>
      expression.</p>
    <p>If an exception occurs during evaluation of <c>ExceptionBody</c>

    <p>If the evaluation of <c>Exprs</c> succeeds without an exception,

    <p>An exception occurring during the evaluation of <c>Body</c> is

    <p>The <c>try</c> expression can also be augmented with an

after

end</code>
    <p><c>AfterBody</c> is evaluated after either <c>Body</c> or
      <c>ExceptionBody</c> no matter which one. The evaluated value of
      <c>AfterBody</c> is lost; the return value of the <c>try</c>
      expression is the same with an <c>after</c> section as without.</p>
    <p>Even if an exception occurs during evaluation of <c>Body</c> or
      <c>ExceptionBody</c>, <c>AfterBody</c> is evaluated. In this case
      the exception is passed on after <c>AfterBody</c> has been
      evaluated, so the exception from the <c>try</c> expression is
      the same with an <c>after</c> section as without.</p>
    <p>If an exception occurs during evaluation of <c>AfterBody</c>
      itself it is not caught, so if <c>AfterBody</c> is evaluated after
      an exception in <c>Exprs</c>, <c>Body</c> or <c>ExceptionBody</c>,
      that exception is lost and masked by the exception in

    <p>The <c>of</c>, <c>catch</c> and <c>after</c> sections are all
      optional, as long as there is at least a <c>catch</c> or an

    <p>List comprehensions are written with the following syntax:</p>
    <pre>
[Expr || Qualifier1,...,QualifierN]</pre>
    <p><c>Expr</c> is an arbitrary expression, and each
      <c>Qualifier</c> is either a generator or a filter.</p>

    <title>Guard Sequences</title>

    <p>A <em>guard sequence</em> is a sequence of guards, separated

      the guards is true. (The remaining guards, if any, will not be
      evaluated.)<br></br>
<c>Guard1;...;GuardK</c></p>
    <p>A <em>guard</em> is a sequence of guard expressions, separated
      by comma (,). The guard is true if all guard expressions

<c>GuardExpr1,...,GuardExprN</c></p>
    <p>The set of valid <em>guard expressions</em> (sometimes called
      guard tests) is a subset of the set of valid Erlang expressions.
      The reason for restricting the set of valid expressions is that
      evaluation of a guard expression must be guaranteed to be free
      of side effects. Valid guard expressions are:</p>

    <p>Note that most type test BIFs have older equivalents, without

      compatibility only and should not be used in new code. They are
      also only allowed at top level. For example, they are not allowed
      in boolean expressions in guards.</p>

    <p>If an arithmetic expression, a boolean expression, a
    short-circuit expression, or a call to a guard BIF fails (because
    of invalid arguments), the entire guard fails. If the guard was
    part of a guard sequence, the next guard in the sequence (that is,
    the guard following the next semicolon) will be evaluated.</p>

    <p>When evaluating an expression, the operator with the highest
      priority is evaluated first. Operators with the same priority
      are evaluated according to their associativity. Example:
      The left associative arithmetic operators are evaluated left to
      right:</p>
    <pre>
<input>6 + 5 * 4 - 3 / 2</input> evaluates to
<input>6 + 20 - 1.5</input> evaluates to
<input>26 - 1.5</input> evaluates to
<input>24.5</input></pre>
