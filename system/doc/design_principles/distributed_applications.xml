    <title>Definition</title>
    <p>In a distributed system with several Erlang nodes, there may be
      a need to control applications in a distributed manner. If
      the node, where a certain application is running, goes down,
      the application should be restarted at another node.</p>
    <p>Such an application is called a <em>distributed application</em>.
      Note that it is the control of the application which is
      distributed, all applications can of course be distributed in
      the sense that they, for example, use services on other nodes.</p>
    <p>Because a distributed application may move between nodes, some
      addressing mechanism is required to ensure that it can be
      addressed by other applications, regardless on which node it
      currently executes. This issue is not addressed here, but the
      Kernel modules <c>global</c> or <c>pg2</c> can be
      used for this purpose.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Specifying Distributed Applications</title>
    <p>Distributed applications are controlled by both the application
      controller and a distributed application controller process,
      <c>dist_ac</c>. Both these processes are part of the <c>kernel</c>
      application. Therefore, distributed applications are specified by
      configuring the <c>kernel</c> application, using the following
      configuration parameter (see also <c>kernel(6)</c>):</p>
    <taglist>
      <tag><c>distributed = [{Application, [Timeout,] NodeDesc}]</c></tag>
      <item>
        <p>Specifies where the application <c>Application = atom()</c>
          may execute. <c>NodeDesc = [Node | {Node,...,Node}]</c> is
          a list of node names in priority order. The order between
          nodes in a tuple is undefined.</p>
        <p><c>Timeout = integer()</c> specifies how many milliseconds to
          wait before restarting the application at another node.
          Defaults to 0.</p>
      </item>
    </taglist>
    <p>For distribution of application control to work properly,
      the nodes where a distributed application may run must contact
      each other and negotiate where to start the application. This is
      done using the following <c>kernel</c> configuration parameters:</p>
    <taglist>
      <tag><c>sync_nodes_mandatory = [Node]</c></tag>
      <item>Specifies which other nodes must be started (within
       the timeout specified by <c>sync_nodes_timeout</c>.</item>
      <tag><c>sync_nodes_optional = [Node]</c></tag>
      <item>Specifies which other nodes can be started (within
       the timeout specified by <c>sync_nodes_timeout</c>.</item>
      <tag><c>sync_nodes_timeout = integer() | infinity</c></tag>
      <item>Specifies how many milliseconds to wait for the other nodes
       to start.</item>
    </taglist>
    <p>When started, the node will wait for all nodes specified by
      <c>sync_nodes_mandatory</c> and <c>sync_nodes_optional</c> to
      come up. When all nodes have come up, or when all mandatory nodes
      have come up and the time specified by <c>sync_nodes_timeout</c>
      has elapsed, all applications will be started. If not all
      mandatory nodes have come up, the node will terminate.</p>
    <p>Example: An application <c>myapp</c> should run at the node
      <c>cp1@cave</c>. If this node goes down, <c>myapp</c> should
      be restarted at <c>cp2@cave</c> or <c>cp3@cave</c>. A system
      configuration file <c>cp1.config</c> for <c>cp1@cave</c> could
      look like:</p>
    <code type="none">
[{kernel,
  [{distributed, [{myapp, 5000, [cp1@cave, {cp2@cave, cp3@cave}]}]},
   {sync_nodes_mandatory, [cp2@cave, cp3@cave]},
   {sync_nodes_timeout, 5000}
  ]
 }
].</code>
    <p>The system configuration files for <c>cp2@cave</c> and
      <c>cp3@cave</c> are identical, except for the list of mandatory
      nodes which should be <c>[cp1@cave, cp3@cave]</c> for
      <c>cp2@cave</c> and <c>[cp1@cave, cp2@cave]</c> for
      <c>cp3@cave</c>.</p>
    <note>
      <p>All involved nodes must have the same value for
        <c>distributed</c> and <c>sync_nodes_timeout</c>, or
        the behaviour of the system is undefined.</p>
    </note>

  <section>
    <title>Starting and Stopping Distributed Applications</title>
    <p>When all involved (mandatory) nodes have been started,
      the distributed application can be started by calling
      <c>application:start(Application)</c> at <em>all of these nodes.</em></p>
    <p>It is of course also possible to use a boot script (see
      <seealso marker="release_structure">Releases</seealso>) which
      automatically starts the application.</p>
    <p>The application will be started at the first node, specified
      by the <c>distributed</c> configuration parameter, which is up
      and running. The application is started as usual. That is, an
      application master is created and calls the application callback
      function:</p>
    <code type="none">
Module:start(normal, StartArgs)</code>
    <p>Example: Continuing the example from the previous section,
      the three nodes are started, specifying the system configuration
      file:</p>
    <pre>
> <input>erl -sname cp1 -config cp1</input>
> <input>erl -sname cp2 -config cp2</input>
> <input>erl -sname cp3 -config cp3</input></pre>
    <p>When all nodes are up and running, <c>myapp</c> can be started.
      This is achieved by calling <c>application:start(myapp)</c> at
      all three nodes. It is then started at <c>cp1</c>, as shown in
      the figure below.</p>

    <image file="../design_principles/dist1.gif">
      <icaption>Application myapp - Situation 1</icaption>
    </image>
    <p>Similarly, the application must be stopped by calling
      <c>application:stop(Application)</c> at all involved nodes.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Failover</title>
    <p>If the node where the application is running goes down,
      the application is restarted (after the specified timeout) at
      the first node, specified by the <c>distributed</c> configuration
      parameter, which is up and running. This is called a
      <em>failover</em>.</p>
    <p>The application is started the normal way at the new node,
      that is, by the application master calling:</p>
    <code type="none">
Module:start(normal, StartArgs)</code>
    <p>Exception: If the application has the <c>start_phases</c> key
      defined (see <seealso marker="included_applications">Included Applications</seealso>), then the application is instead started
      by calling:</p>
    <code type="none">
Module:start({failover, Node}, StartArgs)</code>
    <p>where <c>Node</c> is the terminated node.</p>
    <p>Example: If <c>cp1</c> goes down, the system checks which one of
      the other nodes, <c>cp2</c> or <c>cp3</c>, has the least number of
      running applications, but waits for 5 seconds for <c>cp1</c> to
      restart. If <c>cp1</c> does not restart and <c>cp2</c> runs fewer
      applications than <c>cp3,</c> then <c>myapp</c> is restarted on
      <c>cp2</c>.</p>

      <icaption>Application myapp - Situation 2</icaption>
    </image>
    <p>Suppose now that <c>cp2</c> goes down as well and does not
      restart within 5 seconds. <c>myapp</c> is now restarted on
      <c>cp3</c>.</p>

  <section>
    <title>Takeover</title>
    <p>If a node is started, which has higher priority according
      to <c>distributed</c>, than the node where a distributed
      application is currently running, the application will be
      restarted at the new node and stopped at the old node. This is
      called a <em>takeover</em>.</p>
    <p>The application is started by the application master calling:</p>
    <code type="none">
Module:start({takeover, Node}, StartArgs)</code>
    <p>where <c>Node</c> is the old node.</p>
    <p>Example: If <c>myapp</c> is running at <c>cp3</c>, and if
      <c>cp2</c> now restarts, it will not restart <c>myapp</c>,
      because the order between nodes <c>cp2</c> and <c>cp3</c> is
      undefined.</p>
    <marker id="dist4"></marker>
    <image file="../design_principles/dist4.gif">
      <icaption>Application myapp - Situation 4</icaption>
    </image>
    <p>However, if <c>cp1</c> restarts as well, the function
      <c>application:takeover/2</c> moves <c>myapp</c> to <c>cp1</c>,
      because <c>cp1</c> has a higher priority than <c>cp3</c> for this
      application.  In this case,
      <c>Module:start({takeover, cp3@cave}, StartArgs)</c> is executed
      at <c>cp1</c> to start the application.</p>
