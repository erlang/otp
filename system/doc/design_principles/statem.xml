    This section is to be read with the

    manual page in STDLIB, where all interface functions and callback
    functions are described in detail.

  <note>
    <p>
      This is a new behavior in Erlang/OTP 19.0.
      It has been thoroughly reviewed, is stable enough
      to be used by at least two heavy OTP applications, and is here to stay.
      Depending on user feedback, we do not expect
      but can find it necessary to make minor
      not backward compatible changes into Erlang/OTP 20.0.

    <title>Event-Driven State Machines</title>
    <p>
      Established Automata Theory does not deal much with
      how a state transition is triggered,
      but assumes that the output is a function
      of the input (and the state) and that they are
      some kind of values.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an Event-Driven State Machine, the input is an event
      that triggers a state transition and the output
      is actions executed during the state transition.
      It can analogously to the mathematical model of a
      Finite-State Machine be described as
      a set of relations of the following form:
    </p>
    <pre>
State(S) x Event(E) -> Actions(A), State(S')</pre>
    <p>These relations are interpreted as follows:
      if we are in state <c>S</c> and event <c>E</c> occurs, we
      are to perform actions <c>A</c> and make a transition to
      state <c>S'</c>. Notice that <c>S'</c> can be equal to <c>S</c>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As <c>A</c> and <c>S'</c> depend only on
      <c>S</c> and <c>E</c>, the kind of state machine described
      here is a Mealy Machine
      (see, for example, the corresponding Wikipedia article).
    </p>
    <p>
      Like most <c>gen_</c> behaviors, <c>gen_statem</c> keeps
      a server <c>Data</c> besides the state. Because of this, and as
      there is no restriction on the number of states
      (assuming that there is enough virtual machine memory)
      or on the number of distinct input events,
      a state machine implemented with this behavior
      is in fact Turing complete.
      But it feels mostly like an Event-Driven Mealy Machine.

    <marker id="Callback Modes" />
    <title>Callback Modes</title>
    <p>
      The <c>gen_statem</c> behavior supports two callback modes:
    </p>
    <list type="bulleted">
      <item>
        <p>
          In mode
	  <seealso marker="stdlib:gen_statem#type-callback_mode"><c>state_functions</c></seealso>,
          the state transition rules are written as some Erlang
          functions, which conform to the following convention:
        </p>
        <pre>
StateName(EventType, EventContent, Data) ->
    ... code for actions here ...
    {next_state, NewStateName, NewData}.
	</pre>
	<p>
	  This form is used in most examples here for example in section
	  <seealso marker="#Example">Example</seealso>.
	</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>
          In mode
	  <seealso marker="stdlib:gen_statem#type-callback_mode"><c>handle_event_function</c></seealso>,
          only one Erlang function provides all state transition rules:
        </p>
        <pre>
handle_event(EventType, EventContent, State, Data) ->
    ... code for actions here ...
    {next_state, NewState, NewData}
	</pre>
	<p>
	  See section
	  <seealso marker="#One Event Handler">One Event Handler</seealso>
	  for an example.
	</p>
      </item>
    </list>
    <p>
      Both these modes allow other return tuples; see
      <seealso marker="stdlib:gen_statem#Module:StateName/3"><c>Module:StateName/3</c></seealso>
      in the <c>gen_statem</c> manual page.
      These other return tuples can, for example, stop the machine,
      execute state transition actions on the machine engine itself,
      and send replies.
    </p>

    <section>
      <marker id="Choosing the Callback Mode" />
      <title>Choosing the Callback Mode</title>
      <p>
	The two
	<seealso marker="#Callback Modes">callback modes</seealso>
	give different possibilities
	and restrictions, but one goal remains:
	you want to handle all possible combinations of
	events and states.
      </p>
      <p>
	This can be done, for example, by focusing on one state at the time
	and for every state ensure that all events are handled.
	Alternatively, you can focus on one event at the time
	and ensure that it is handled in every state.
	You can also use a mix of these strategies.
      </p>
      <p>
	With <c>state_functions</c>, you are restricted to use
	atom-only states, and the <c>gen_statem</c> engine
	branches depending on state name for you.
	This encourages the callback module to gather
	the implementation of all event actions particular
	to one state in the same place in the code,
	hence to focus on one state at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
	This mode fits well when you have a regular state diagram,
	like the ones in this chapter, which describes all events and actions
	belonging to a state visually around that state,
	and each state has its unique name.
      </p>
      <p>
	With <c>handle_event_function</c>, you are free to mix strategies,
	as all events and states are handled in the same callback function.
      </p>
      <p>
	This mode works equally well when you want to focus on
	one event at the time or on
	one state at the time, but function
	<seealso marker="stdlib:gen_statem#Module:handle_event/4"><c>Module:handle_event/4</c></seealso>
	quickly grows too large to handle without branching to
	helper functions.
      </p>
      <p>
	The mode enables the use of non-atom states, for example,
	complex states or even hierarchical states.
	If, for example, a state diagram is largely alike
	for the client side and the server side of a protocol,
	you can have a state <c>{StateName,server}</c> or
	<c>{StateName,client}</c>,
	and make <c>StateName</c> determine where in the code
	to handle most events in the state.
	The second element of the tuple is then used to select
	whether to handle special client-side or server-side events.
      </p>

  <section>
    <marker id="State Enter Calls" />
    <title>State Enter Calls</title>
    <p>
      The <c>gen_statem</c> behavior can regardless of callback mode
      automatically
      <seealso marker="stdlib:gen_statem#type-state_enter">
	call the state callback
      </seealso>
      with special arguments whenever the state changes
      so you can write state entry actions
      near the rest of the state transition rules.
      It typically looks like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
StateName(enter, _OldState, Data) ->
    ... code for state entry actions here ...
    {keep_state, NewData};
StateName(EventType, EventContent, Data) ->
    ... code for actions here ...
    {next_state, NewStateName, NewData}.</pre>
    <p>
      Depending on how your state machine is specified,
      this can be a very useful feature,
      but it forces you to handle the state enter calls in all states.
      See also the
      <seealso marker="#State Entry Actions">

    <title>Actions</title>
    <p>
      In the first section
      <seealso marker="#Event-Driven State Machines">
	Event-Driven State Machines
      </seealso>
      actions were mentioned as a part of
      the general state machine model. These general actions
      are implemented with the code that callback module
      <c>gen_statem</c> executes in an event-handling
      callback function before returning
      to the <c>gen_statem</c> engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are more specific state-transition actions
      that a callback function can order the <c>gen_statem</c>
      engine to do after the callback function return.
      These are ordered by returning a list of
      <seealso marker="stdlib:gen_statem#type-action">actions</seealso>
      in the
      <seealso marker="stdlib:gen_statem#type-state_callback_result">return tuple</seealso>
      from the
      <seealso marker="stdlib:gen_statem#Module:StateName/3">callback function</seealso>.
      These state transition actions affect the <c>gen_statem</c>
      engine itself and can do the following:

      In later sections, additions and tweaks are made

      A door with a code lock can be seen as a state machine.
      Initially, the door is locked. When someone presses a button,
      an event is generated.
      Depending on what buttons have been pressed before,
      the sequence so far can be correct, incomplete, or wrong.
      If correct, the door is unlocked for 10 seconds (10,000 milliseconds).
      If incomplete, we wait for another button to be pressed. If
      wrong, we start all over, waiting for a new button sequence.

    <p>
      The first argument is the name of the <c>gen_statem</c> and must
      agree with the name used to start it. So, we use the

      <c>{button,Digit}</c> is the event content.
    </p>
    <p>
      The event is made into a message and sent to the <c>gen_statem</c>.
      When the event is received, the <c>gen_statem</c> calls
      <c>StateName(cast, Event, Data)</c>, which is expected to
      return a tuple <c>{next_state, NewStateName, NewData}</c>,
      or <c>{next_state, NewStateName, NewData, Actions}</c>.
      <c>StateName</c> is the name of the current state and
      <c>NewStateName</c> is the name of the next state to go to.
      <c>NewData</c> is a new value for the server data of
      the <c>gen_statem</c>, and <c>Actions</c> is a list of

    <p>
      If the door is locked and a button is pressed, the pressed
      button is compared with the next correct button.
      Depending on the result, the door is either unlocked
      and the <c>gen_statem</c> goes to state <c>open</c>,
      or the door remains in state <c>locked</c>.
    </p>

      If the pressed button is incorrect, the server data
      restarts from the start of the code sequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the whole code is correct, the server changes states
      to <c>open</c>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In state <c>open</c>, a button event is ignored
      by staying in the same state.  This can also be done
      by returning <c>{keep_state, Data}</c> or in this case

      10,000 is a time-out value in milliseconds.
      After this time (10 seconds), a time-out occurs.
      Then, <c>StateName(state_timeout, lock, Data)</c> is called.
      The time-out occurs when the door has been in state <c>open</c>
      for 10 seconds. After that the door is locked again:

      The timer for a state time-out is automatically cancelled
      when the state machine changes states.  You can restart
      a state time-out by setting it to a new time, which cancels
      the running timer and starts a new.  This implies that

	If the <c>gen_statem</c> is part of a supervision tree,

	set in the supervisor.
      </p>
      <p>
	If it is necessary to clean up before termination, the shutdown

	in function <c>init/1</c> set itself to trap exit signals
	by calling

      A timeout feature inherited from <c>gen_statem</c>'s predecessor
      <seealso marker="stdlib:gen_fsm"><c>gen_fsm</c></seealso>,
      is an event time-out, that is,
      if an event arrives the timer is cancelled.
      You get either an event or a time-out, but not both.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is ordered by the state transition action
      <c>{timeout,Time,EventContent}</c>, or just <c>Time</c>,
      or even just <c>Time</c> instead of an action list
      (the latter is a form inherited from <c>gen_fsm</c>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This type of time-out is useful to for example act on inactivity.
      Let us restart the code sequence
      if no button is pressed for say 30 seconds:
    </p>
    <code type="erl"><![CDATA[
...

locked(
  timeout, _, 
  #{code := Code, remaining := Remaining} = Data) ->
    {next_state, locked, Data#{remaining := Code}};
locked(
  cast, {button,Digit},
  #{code := Code, remaining := Remaining} = Data) ->
...
        [Digit|Rest] -> % Incomplete
            {next_state, locked, Data#{remaining := Rest}, 30000};
...
     ]]></code>
    <p>
      Whenever we receive a button event we start an event timeout
      of 30 seconds, and if we get an event type <c>timeout</c>
      we reset the remaining code sequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      An event timeout is cancelled by any other event so you either
      get some other event or the timeout event.  It is therefore
      not possible nor needed to cancel or restart an event timeout.
      Whatever event you act on has already cancelled
      the event timeout...

    <p>
      The previous example of state time-outs only work if
      the state machine stays in the same state during the
      time-out time.  And event time-outs only work if no
      disturbing unrelated events occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may want to start a timer in one state and respond
      to the time-out in another, maybe cancel the time-out
      without changing states, or perhaps run multiple
      time-outs in parallel. All this can be accomplished
      with Erlang Timers:
      <seealso marker="erts:erlang#start_timer/4"><c>erlang:start_timer3,4</c></seealso>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is how to accomplish the state time-out
      in the previous example by insted using an Erlang Timer:
    </p>
    <code type="erl"><![CDATA[
...
locked(
  cast, {button,Digit},
  #{code := Code, remaining := Remaining} = Data) ->
    case Remaining of
        [Digit] ->
	    do_unlock(),
	    Tref = erlang:start_timer(10000, self(), lock),
            {next_state, open, Data#{remaining := Code, timer => Tref}};
...

open(info, {timeout,Tref,lock}, #{timer := Tref} = Data) ->
    do_lock(),
    {next_state,locked,maps:remove(timer, Data)};
open(cast, {button,_}, Data) ->
    {keep_state,Data};
...
    ]]></code>
    <p>
      Removing the <c>timer</c> key from the map when we
      change to state <c>locked</c> is not strictly
      necessary since we can only get into state <c>open</c>
      with an updated <c>timer</c> map value.  But it can be nice
      to not have outdated values in the state <c>Data</c>!
    </p>
    <p>
      If you need to cancel a timer because of some other event, you can use
      <seealso marker="erts:erlang#cancel_timer/2"><c>erlang:cancel_timer(Tref)</c></seealso>.
      Note that a time-out message cannot arrive after this,
      unless you have postponed it before (see the next section),
      so ensure that you do not accidentally postpone such messages.
      Also note that a time-out message may have arrived
      just before you cancelling it, so you may have to read out
      such a message from the process mailbox depending on
      the return value from 
      <seealso marker="erts:erlang#cancel_timer/2"><c>erlang:cancel_timer(Tref)</c></seealso>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another way to handle a late time-out can be to not cancel it,
      but to ignore it if it arrives in a state
      where it is known to be late.

    <marker id="Postponing Events" />
    <title>Postponing Events</title>
    <p>
      If you want to ignore a particular event in the current state
      and handle it in a future state, you can postpone the event.
      A postponed event is retried after the state has
      changed, that is, <c>OldState =/= NewState</c>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Postponing is ordered by the state transition
      <seealso marker="stdlib:gen_statem#type-action">action</seealso>
      <c>postpone</c>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this example, instead of ignoring button events
      while in the <c>open</c> state, we can postpone them
      and they are queued and later handled in the <c>locked</c> state:
    </p>
    <code type="erl"><![CDATA[
...
open(cast, {button,_}, Data) ->
    {keep_state,Data,[postpone]};
...
    ]]></code>
    <p>
      Since a postponed event is only retried after a state change,
      you have to think about where to keep a state data item.
      You can keep it in the server <c>Data</c>
      or in the <c>State</c> itself,
      for example by having two more or less identical states
      to keep a boolean value, or by using a complex state with
      <seealso marker="#Callback Modes">callback mode</seealso>
      <seealso marker="stdlib:gen_statem#type-callback_mode"><c>handle_event_function</c></seealso>.
      If a change in the value changes the set of events that is handled,
      then the value should be kept in the State.
      Otherwise no postponed events will be retried
      since only the server Data changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not important if you do not postpone events.
      But if you later decide to start postponing some events,
      then the design flaw of not having separate states
      when they should be, might become a hard to find bug.

      <p>
        Erlang's selective receive statement is often used to
        describe simple state machine examples in straightforward
        Erlang code. The following is a possible implementation of
        the first example:
      </p>

start_link(Code) ->

      fun () ->
	      true = register(?NAME, self()),
	      do_lock(),
	      locked(Code, Code)
      end).

button(Digit) ->
    ?NAME ! {button,Digit}.

locked(Code, [Digit|Remaining]) ->
    receive
	{button,Digit} when Remaining =:= [] ->
	    do_unlock(),
	    open(Code);
	{button,Digit} ->
	    locked(Code, Remaining);
	{button,_} ->
	    locked(Code, Code)
    end.

open(Code) ->
    receive
    after 10000 ->
	    do_lock(),
	    locked(Code, Code)
    end.

do_lock() ->
    io:format("Locked~n", []).
do_unlock() ->
    io:format("Open~n", []).
    ]]></code>
    <p>
      The selective receive in this case causes implicitly <c>open</c>
      to postpone any events to the <c>locked</c> state.
    </p>
    <p>
      A selective receive cannot be used from a <c>gen_statem</c>
      behavior as for any <c>gen_*</c> behavior,
      as the receive statement is within the <c>gen_*</c> engine itself.
      It must be there because all
      <seealso marker="stdlib:sys"><c>sys</c></seealso>
      compatible behaviors must respond to system messages and therefore
      do that in their engine receive loop,
      passing non-system messages to the callback module.
    </p>
    <p>
      The state transition
      <seealso marker="stdlib:gen_statem#type-action">action</seealso>
      <c>postpone</c> is designed to model
      selective receives. A selective receive implicitly postpones
      any not received events, but the <c>postpone</c>
      state transition action explicitly postpones one received event.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both mechanisms have the same theoretical
      time and memory complexity, while the selective receive
      language construct has smaller constant factors.

    <p>
      It can sometimes be beneficial to be able to generate events
      to your own state machine.
      This can be done with the state transition
      <seealso marker="stdlib:gen_statem#type-action">action</seealso>
      <c>{next_event,EventType,EventContent}</c>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can generate events of any existing
      <seealso marker="stdlib:gen_statem#type-action">type</seealso>,
      but the <c>internal</c> type can only be generated through action
      <c>next_event</c>. Hence, it cannot come from an external source,
      so you can be certain that an <c>internal</c> event is an event
      from your state machine to itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      One example for this is to pre-process incoming data, for example
      decrypting chunks or collecting characters up to a line break.
      Purists may argue that this should be modelled with a separate
      state machine that sends pre-processed events
      to the main state machine.
      But to decrease overhead the small pre-processing state machine
      can be implemented in the common state event handling
      of the main state machine using a few state data variables
      that then sends the pre-processed events as internal events
      to the main state machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following example uses an input model where you give the lock
      characters with <c>put_chars(Chars)</c> and then call
      <c>enter()</c> to finish the input.
    </p>
    <code type="erl"><![CDATA[

      This section includes the example after most of the mentioned
      modifications and some more using state enter calls,
      which deserves a new state diagram:

    </image>
    <p>
      Notice that this state diagram does not specify how to handle
      a button event in the state <c>open</c>. So, you need to
      read somewhere else that unspecified events
      must be ignored as in not consumed but handled in some other state.
      Also, the state diagram does not show that the <c>code_length/0</c>
      call must be handled in every state.

      Notice that postponing buttons from the <c>locked</c> state
      to the <c>open</c> state feels like a strange thing to do
      for a code lock, but it at least illustrates event postponing.

    <marker id="Filter the State" />
    <title>Filter the State</title>
    <p>
      The example servers so far in this chapter
      print the full internal state in the error log, for example,
      when killed by an exit signal or because of an internal error.
      This state contains both the code lock code
      and which digits that remain to unlock.
    </p>
    <p>
      This state data can be regarded as sensitive,
      and maybe not what you want in the error log
      because of some unpredictable event.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another reason to filter the state can be
      that the state is too large to print, as it fills
      the error log with uninteresting details.
    </p>
    <p>
      To avoid this, you can format the internal state
      that gets in the error log and gets returned from
      <seealso marker="stdlib:sys#get_status/1"><c>sys:get_status/1,2</c></seealso>
      by implementing function
      <seealso marker="stdlib:gen_statem#Module:format_status/2"><c>Module:format_status/2</c></seealso>,
      for example like this:
    </p>
    <code type="erl"><![CDATA[
...
-export([init/1,terminate/3,code_change/4,format_status/2]).
...

format_status(Opt, [_PDict,State,Data]) ->
    StateData =
	{State,
	 maps:filter(
	   fun (code, _) -> false;
	       (remaining, _) -> false;
	       (_, _) -> true
	   end,
	   Data)},
    case Opt of
	terminate ->
	    StateData;
	normal ->
	    [{data,[{"State",StateData}]}]
    end.
    ]]></code>
    <p>
      It is not mandatory to implement a
      <seealso marker="stdlib:gen_statem#Module:format_status/2"><c>Module:format_status/2</c></seealso>
      function. If you do not, a default implementation is used that
      does the same as this example function without filtering
      the <c>Data</c> term, that is, <c>StateData = {State,Data}</c>,
      in this example containing sensitive information.

    <marker id="Complex State" />
    <title>Complex State</title>
    <p>
      The callback mode
      <seealso marker="stdlib:gen_statem#type-callback_mode"><c>handle_event_function</c></seealso>
      enables using a non-atom state as described in section
      <seealso marker="#Callback Modes">Callback Modes</seealso>,
      for example, a complex state term like a tuple.
    </p>
    <p>
      One reason to use this is when you have
      a state item that affects the event handling,
      in particular in combination with postponing events.
      We complicate the previous example
      by introducing a configurable lock button
      (this is the state item in question),
      which in the <c>open</c> state immediately locks the door,
      and an API function <c>set_lock_button/1</c> to set the lock button.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose now that we call <c>set_lock_button</c>
      while the door is open,
      and have already postponed a button event
      that until now was not the lock button.
      The sensible thing can be to say that
      the button was pressed too early so it is
      not to be recognized as the lock button.
      However, then it can be surprising that a button event
      that now is the lock button event arrives (as retried postponed)
      immediately after the state transits to <c>locked</c>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we make the <c>button/1</c> function synchronous
      by using
      <seealso marker="stdlib:gen_statem#call/2"><c>gen_statem:call</c></seealso>
      and still postpone its events in the <c>open</c> state.
      Then a call to <c>button/1</c> during the <c>open</c>
      state does not return until the state transits to <c>locked</c>,
      as it is there the event is handled and the reply is sent.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a process now calls <c>set_lock_button/1</c>
      to change the lock button while another process
      hangs in <c>button/1</c> with the new lock button,
      it can be expected that the hanging lock button call
      immediately takes effect and locks the lock.
      Therefore, we make the current lock button a part of the state,
      so that when we change the lock button, the state changes
      and all postponed events are retried.
    </p>
    <p>
      We define the state as <c>{StateName,LockButton}</c>,
      where <c>StateName</c> is as before
      and <c>LockButton</c> is the current lock button:

    <title>Hibernation</title>
    <p>
      If you have many servers in one node
      and they have some state(s) in their lifetime in which
      the servers can be expected to idle for a while,
      and the amount of heap memory all these servers need
      is a problem, then the memory footprint of a server
      can be mimimized by hibernating it through
      <seealso marker="stdlib:proc_lib#hibernate/3"><c>proc_lib:hibernate/3</c></seealso>.
    </p>
    <note>
      <p>
        It is rather costly to hibernate a process; see
        <seealso marker="erts:erlang#hibernate/3"><c>erlang:hibernate/3</c></seealso>.
        It is not something you want to do after every event.
      </p>
    </note>
    <p>
      We can in this example hibernate in the <c>{open,_}</c> state,
      because what normally occurs in that state is that
      the state time-out after a while
      triggers a transition to <c>{locked,_}</c>:

	    {keep_state_and_data,

    <p>
      The atom
      <seealso marker="stdlib:gen_statem#type-hibernate"><c>hibernate</c></seealso>
      in the action list on the last line
      when entering the <c>{open,_}</c> state is the only change.
      If any event arrives in the <c>{open,_},</c> state, we
      do not bother to rehibernate, so the server stays
      awake after any event.
    </p>
    <p>
      To change that we would need to insert
      action <c>hibernate</c> in more places.
      For example, for the state-independent <c>set_lock_button</c>
      and <c>code_length</c> operations that then would have to
      be aware of using <c>hibernate</c> while in the
      <c>{open,_}</c> state, which would clutter the code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another not uncommon scenario is to use the event time-out
      to triger hibernation after a certain time of inactivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This server probably does not use
      heap memory worth hibernating for.
      To gain anything from hibernation, your server would
      have to produce some garbage during callback execution,
      for which this example server can serve as a bad example.
