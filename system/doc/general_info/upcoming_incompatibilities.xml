    <p>This document lists planned upcoming potential incompatibilities in
    Erlang/OTP.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>OTP 27</title>

    <section>
      <marker id="fun_creator_pid"/>
      <title>Fun creator pid will always be local init process</title>
      <p>
        As of OTP 27, the functions
        <seemfa marker="erts:erlang#fun_info/1">
        <c>erlang:fun_info/1,2</c></seemfa> will always say that the local
        <c>init</c> process created all funs, regardless of which process or
        node the fun was originally created on.
      </p>
      <p>
        In OTP 28, the <c>{pid,_}</c>element will be removed altogether.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <marker id="maybe_expr"/>
      <title>Feature maybe_expr will be enabled by default</title>
      <p>
	As of OTP 27, the <c>maybe_expr</c> feature will be approved
	and enabled by default. That means that code that uses the
	unquoted atom <c>maybe</c> will fail to compile. All uses of
	<c>maybe</c> as an atom will need to be quoted. Alternatively, as a
	short-term solution, the <c>maybe_expr</c> feature can be
	disabled.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is recommend to quote all uses of the atom <c>maybe</c> as soon as
        possible. The compiler option <c>warn_keywords</c> can be used to emit
        warnings about all occurrences of <c>maybe</c> without quotes.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <marker id="new_re_engine"/>
      <title>The re module will use a different regular expression engine</title>

      <p>The functionality of module <seeerl
      marker="stdlib:re"><c>re</c></seeerl> is currently provided by
      the PCRE library, which is no longer actively
      maintained. Therefore, in OTP 27, we will switch to a different
      regular expression library.</p>

      <p>The source code for PCRE used by the <c>re</c> module has
      been modified by the OTP team to ensure that a regular
      expression match would yield when matching huge input binaries
      and/or when using demanding (back-tracking) regular
      expressions. Because of the those modifications, moving to a new
      version of PCRE has always been a time-consuming process because
      all of the modifications had to be applied by hand again to the
      updated PCRE source code.</p>

      <p>Most likely, the new regular expression library will be <url
      href="https://github.com/google/re2">RE2</url>. RE2 guarantees
      that the match time is linear in the length of input string, and
      it also eschews recursion to avoid stack overflow. That should
      make it possible to use RE2 without modifying its source
      code. For more information about why RE2 is a good choice, see
      <url
      href="https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/WhyRE2">WhyRE2</url>.</p>

      <p>Some of implications of this change are:</p>

      <list>
        <item><p>We expect that the functions in the <c>re</c> module
        will continue to be supported, although some of the options are likely
        to be dis-continued.</p></item>

        <item><p>It is likely that only pattern matching of UTF8-encoded binaries will be
        supported (not Latin1-encoded binaries).</p></item>

        <item><p>In order to guarantee the linear-time performance,
        RE2 does not support all the constructs in regular expression
        patterns that PCRE do. For example, backreferences and look-around
        assertions are not supported. See <url
        href="https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax">Syntax</url>
        for a description of what RE2 supports.</p></item>

        <item><p>Compiling a regular expression is likely to be
        slower, and thus more can be gained by explicitly compiling
        the regular expression before matching with it.</p></item>
      </list>
    </section>

    <section>
      <marker id="float_matching"/>
      <title>0.0 and -0.0 will no longer be exactly equal</title>

      <p>Currently, the floating point numbers <c>0.0</c> and <c>-0.0</c>
      have distinct internal representations. That can be seen if they are
      converted to binaries:</p>
      <pre>
1&gt; <input>&lt;&lt;0.0/float&gt;&gt;.</input>
&lt;&lt;0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0&gt;&gt;
2&gt; <input>&lt;&lt;-0.0/float&gt;>.</input>
&lt;&lt;128,0,0,0,0,0,0,0>></pre>

      <p>However, when they are matched against each other or compared
      using the <c>=:=</c> operator, they are considered to be
      equal. Thus, <c>0.0 =:= -0.0</c> currently returns
      <c>true</c>.</p>

      <p>In Erlang/OTP 27, <c>0.0 =:= -0.0</c> will return <c>false</c>, and matching
      <c>0.0</c> against <c>-0.0</c> will fail. When used as map keys, <c>0.0</c> and
      <c>-0.0</c> will be considered to be distinct.</p>

      <p>The <c>==</c> operator will continue to return <c>true</c>
      for <c>0.0 == -0.0</c>.</p>

      <p>To help to find code that might need to be revised, in OTP 27
      there will be a new compiler warning when matching against
      <c>0.0</c> or comparing to that value using the <c>=:=</c>
      operator. The warning can be suppressed by matching against
      <c>+0.0</c> instead of <c>0.0</c>.</p>

      <p>We plan to introduce the same warning in OTP 26.1, but by default it
      will be disabled.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <marker id="singleton_typevars"/>
      <title>Singleton type variables will become a compile-time error</title>

      <p>Before Erlang/OTP 26, the compiler would silenty accept the
      following spec:</p>

      <pre>
-spec f(Opts) -> term() when
    Opts :: {ok, Unknown} | {error, Unknown}.
f(_) -> error.</pre>

    <p>In OTP 26, the compiler emits a warning pointing out that the type variable
    <c>Unknown</c> is unbound:</p>

    <pre>
t.erl:6:18: Warning: type variable 'Unknown' is only used once (is unbound)
%    6|     Opts :: {ok, Unknown} | {error, Unknown}.
%     |                  ^</pre>

    <p>In OTP 27, that warning will become an error.</p>
    </section>

  </section>

  <section>
    <title>OTP 28</title>

    <section>
      <marker id="fun_creator_pid"/>
      <title>Fun creator pid will be removed</title>
      <p>
        As of OTP 28, the function <seemfa
        marker="erts:erlang#fun_info/1"><c>erlang:fun_info/1</c></seemfa>
        will not include the <c>{pid,_}</c> element and the function
        <seemfa marker="erts:erlang#fun_info/2"><c>erlang:fun_info/2</c></seemfa>
        will no longer accept <c>pid</c> as the second argument.</p>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>OTP 29</title>

    <section>
      <title>It will no longer be possible to disable feature maybe_expr</title>
      <p>
	As of OTP 29, the <c>maybe_expr</c> feature will become
	permanent and no longer possible to disable. All uses of
	<c>maybe</c> as an atom will need to be	quoted.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is recommend to quote all uses of the atom <c>maybe</c> as soon as
        possible. The compiler option <c>warn_keywords</c> can be used to emit
        warnings about all occurrences of <c>maybe</c> without quotes.
