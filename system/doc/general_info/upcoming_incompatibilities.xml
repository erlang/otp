    <p>This document lists planned upcoming potential incompatibilities in
    Erlang/OTP.</p>

      <title>Fun creator pid will always be local init process</title>
      <p>
        As of OTP 27, the functions
        <seemfa marker="erts:erlang#fun_info/1">
        <c>erlang:fun_info/1,2</c></seemfa> will always say that the local
        <c>init</c> process created all funs, regardless of which process or
        node the fun was originally created on.
      </p>
      <p>
        In OTP 28, the <c>{pid,_}</c>element will be removed altogether.</p>

      <title>Feature maybe_expr will be enabled by default</title>
      <p>
	As of OTP 27, the <c>maybe_expr</c> feature will be approved
	and enabled by default. That means that code that uses the
	unquoted atom <c>maybe</c> will fail to compile. All uses of
	<c>maybe</c> as an atom will need to be quoted. Alternatively, as a
	short-term solution, the <c>maybe_expr</c> feature can be
	disabled.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is recommend to quote all uses of the atom <c>maybe</c> as soon as
        possible. The compiler option <c>warn_keywords</c> can be used to emit
        warnings about all occurrences of <c>maybe</c> without quotes.

      <title>Fun creator pid will be removed</title>
      <p>
        As of OTP 28, the function <seemfa
        marker="erts:erlang#fun_info/1"><c>erlang:fun_info/1</c></seemfa>
        will not include the <c>{pid,_}</c> element and the function
        <seemfa marker="erts:erlang#fun_info/2"><c>erlang:fun_info/2</c></seemfa>
        will no longer accept <c>pid</c> as the second argument.</p>

    <title>OTP 29</title>

    <section>
      <title>It will no longer be possible to disable feature maybe_expr</title>
      <p>
	As of OTP 29, the <c>maybe_expr</c> feature will become
	permanent and no longer possible to disable. All uses of
	<c>maybe</c> as an atom will need to be	quoted.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is recommend to quote all uses of the atom <c>maybe</c> as soon as
        possible. The compiler option <c>warn_keywords</c> can be used to emit
        warnings about all occurrences of <c>maybe</c> without quotes.
