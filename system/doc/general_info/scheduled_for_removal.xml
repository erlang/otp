      <title>VxWorks Support</title>

      <title>Legacy parts of erl_interface</title>
      <p>The old legacy <seealso marker="erl_interface:index"><c>erl_interface</c></seealso>
      library (functions with prefix <c>erl_</c>) will be removed as of
      OTP 23. These parts of <c>erl_interface</c> has been informally deprecated
      for a very long time, and was formally deprecated in OTP 22. You typically
      want to replace the usage of the <c>erl_interface</c> library with the use
      of the <c>ei</c> library which also is part of the <c>erl_interface</c>
      application.</p>
