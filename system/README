        -------

1.1     Installation Guide

        The installation guide can be found in

                <inst-root>doc/installation_guide/users_guide.html

1.2     Java

        The Java sources were compiled using Java version 1.5.

1.3     Disk space

        An installation of Erlang/OTP needs approximately 300 MB of
        disk space.

1.4     The package contains HTML documentation. You can also get this
        documentation preformatted for printing in PDF format from

            http://www.erlang.se/doc/

        This site also contains HTML documentation for older releases
        as a reference.

1.5     The Erlang system can run old BEAM files compiled with R11B-2
	or later (and almost all BEAM files compiled with R11B-0 or
	R11B-1). BEAM files from R10B or earlier are not supported.

	To get the best performance, you should recompile your
	application code with the R15B compiler.
