{abstract, 
 "Implements a set of tools for processing XML documents, as well as "
 "working with XML-like structures in Erlang. The main attraction so far "
 "is a single-pass, highly customizable XML processor. Other components are "
 "an export/translation facility and an XPATH query engine. "
 "This version fixes a few bugs in the scanner, and improves HTML export. "
 "The latest version can be found at http://sowap.sourceforge.net/ "
 "Note that this is still very much a beta product."}.
