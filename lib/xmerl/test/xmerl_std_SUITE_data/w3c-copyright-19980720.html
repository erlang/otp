<p>This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on
August 14 1998 so as to improve compatibility with GPL. This
version ensures that W3C software licensing terms are no more
restrictive than GPL and consequently W3C software may be
distributed in GPL packages. See the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software-19980519.html">older formulation</a> for
the policy prior to this date. Please see our <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ.html">Copyright FAQ</a> for common questions about
using materials from our site, including specific terms and
conditions for packages like libwww, Amaya, and Jigsaw. Other
