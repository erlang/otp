File interface module.

This module provides an interface to the file system.

> #### Warning {: .warning }
>
> File operations are only guaranteed to appear atomic when going through the
> same file server. A NIF or other OS process may observe intermediate steps on
> certain operations on some operating systems, eg. renaming an existing file on
> Windows, or [`write_file_info/2`](`write_file_info/2`) on any OS at the time
> of writing.

Regarding filename encoding, the Erlang VM can operate in two modes. The current
mode can be queried using function `native_name_encoding/0`. It returns `latin1`
or `utf8`.

In `latin1` mode, the Erlang VM does not change the encoding of filenames. In
`utf8` mode, filenames can contain Unicode characters greater than 255 and the
VM converts filenames back and forth to the native filename encoding (usually
UTF-8, but UTF-16 on Windows).

The default mode depends on the operating system. Windows, MacOS X and Android
enforce consistent filename encoding and therefore the VM uses `utf8` mode.

On operating systems with transparent naming (for example, all Unix systems
except MacOS X), default is `utf8` if the terminal supports UTF-8, otherwise
`latin1`. The default can be overridden using `+fnl` (to force `latin1` mode) or
`+fnu` (to force `utf8` mode) when starting [`erl`](`e:erts:erl_cmd.md`).

On operating systems with transparent naming, files can be inconsistently named,
for example, some files are encoded in UTF-8 while others are encoded in ISO
Latin-1. The concept of _raw filenames_ is introduced to handle file systems
with inconsistent naming when running in `utf8` mode.

A _raw filename_ is a filename specified as a binary. The Erlang VM does not
translate a filename specified as a binary on systems with transparent naming.

When running in `utf8` mode, functions `list_dir/1` and `read_link/1` never
return raw filenames. To return all filenames including raw filenames, use
functions `list_dir_all/1` and `read_link_all/1`.

See also section
[Notes About Raw Filenames](`e:stdlib:unicode_usage.md#notes-about-raw-filenames`)
in the STDLIB User's Guide.

## Performance

For increased performance, raw files are recommended.

A normal file is really a process so it can be used as an I/O device (see
`m:io`). Therefore, when data is written to a normal file, the sending of the
data to the file process, copies all data that are not binaries. Opening the
file in binary mode and writing binaries is therefore recommended. If the file
is opened on another node, or if the file server runs as slave to the file
server of another node, also binaries are copied.

> #### Note {: .info }
>
> Raw files use the file system of the host machine of the node. For normal
> files (non-raw), the file server is used to find the files, and if the node is
> running its file server as slave to the file server of another node, and the
> other node runs on some other host machine, they can have different file
> systems. However, this is seldom a problem.

`open/2` can be given the options `delayed_write` and `read_ahead` to turn on
caching, which will reduce the number of operating system calls and greatly
improve performance for small reads and writes. However, the overhead won't
disappear completely and it's best to keep the number of file operations to a
minimum. As a contrived example, the following function writes 4MB in 2.5
seconds when tested:

```erlang
create_file_slow(Name) ->
    {ok, Fd} = file:open(Name, [raw, write, delayed_write, binary]),
    create_file_slow_1(Fd, 4 bsl 20),
    file:close(Fd).

create_file_slow_1(_Fd, 0) ->
    ok;
create_file_slow_1(Fd, M) ->
    ok = file:write(Fd, <<0>>),
    create_file_slow_1(Fd, M - 1).
```

The following functionally equivalent code writes 128 bytes per call to
`write/2` and so does the same work in 0.08 seconds, which is roughly 30 times
faster:

```erlang
create_file(Name) ->
    {ok, Fd} = file:open(Name, [raw, write, delayed_write, binary]),
    create_file_1(Fd, 4 bsl 20),
    file:close(Fd),
    ok.

create_file_1(_Fd, 0) ->
    ok;
create_file_1(Fd, M) when M >= 128 ->
    ok = file:write(Fd, <<0:(128)/unit:8>>),
    create_file_1(Fd, M - 128);
create_file_1(Fd, M) ->
    ok = file:write(Fd, <<0:(M)/unit:8>>),
    create_file_1(Fd, M - 1).
```

When writing data it's generally more efficient to write a list of binaries
rather than a list of integers. It is not needed to flatten a deep list before
writing. On Unix hosts, scatter output, which writes a set of buffers in one
operation, is used when possible. In this way
[`write(FD, [Bin1, Bin2 | Bin3])`](`write/2`) writes the contents of the
binaries without copying the data at all, except for perhaps deep down in the
operating system kernel.

> #### Warning {: .warning }

> If an error occurs when accessing an open file with module `m:io`, the process
> handling the file exits. The dead file process can hang if a process tries to
> access it later. This will be fixed in a future release.

Retrieves information about a file. Returns `{ok, FileInfo}` if successful,
otherwise `{error, Reason}`.

`FileInfo` is a record `file_info`, defined in the Kernel include file `file.hrl`.
Include the following directive in the module from which the function is called:

```erlang
-include_lib("kernel/include/file.hrl").
```

The time type returned in `atime`, `mtime`, and `ctime` is dependent on the time
type set in `Opts :: {time, Type}` as follows:

- **`local`** - Returns local time.

- **`universal`** - Returns universal time.

- **`posix`** - Returns seconds since or before Unix time epoch, which is
  1970-01-01 00:00 UTC.

Default is `{time, local}`.

If the option `raw` is set, the file server is not called and only information
about local files is returned. Note that this will break this module's atomicity
guarantees as it can race with a concurrent call to
[`write_file_info/1,2` ](`write_file_info/2`).

This option has no effect when the function is given an I/O device instead of a
file name. Use `open/2` with the `raw` mode to obtain a file descriptor first.

> #### Note {: .info }
>
> As file times are stored in POSIX time on most OS, it is faster to query file
> information with option `posix`.

The record `file_info` contains the following fields:

- **`size = ` `t:non_neg_integer/0`** - Size of file in bytes.

- **`type = device | directory | other | regular`** - The type of the file. Can
  also contain `symlink` when returned from
  [read_link_info/1,2](`read_link_info/1`).

- **`access = read | write | read_write | none`** - The current system access to
  the file.

- **`atime = ` `t:date_time/0` ` | ` `t:non_neg_integer/0`** - The last time the file was
  read.

- **`mtime = ` `t:date_time/0` ` | ` `t:non_neg_integer/0`** - The last time the file was
  written.

- **`ctime = ` `t:date_time/0` ` | ` `t:non_neg_integer/0`** - The interpretation of this
  time field depends on the operating system. On Unix, it is the last time the
  file or the `inode` was changed. In Windows, it is the create time.

- **`mode = ` `t:non_neg_integer/0`** - The file permissions as the sum of the following
  bit values:

  - **`8#00400`** - read permission: owner

  - **`8#00200`** - write permission: owner

  - **`8#00100`** - execute permission: owner

  - **`8#00040`** - read permission: group

  - **`8#00020`** - write permission: group

  - **`8#00010`** - execute permission: group

  - **`8#00004`** - read permission: other

  - **`8#00002`** - write permission: other

  - **`8#00001`** - execute permission: other

  - **`16#800`** - set user id on execution

  - **`16#400`** - set group id on execution

  On Unix platforms, other bits than those listed above may be set.

- **`links = ` `t:non_neg_integer/0`** - Number of links to the file (this is always 1
  for file systems that have no concept of links).

- **`major_device = ` `t:non_neg_integer/0`** - Identifies the file system where the
  file is located. In Windows, the number indicates a drive as follows: 0 means
  A:, 1 means B:, and so on.

- **`minor_device = ` `t:non_neg_integer/0`** - Only valid for character devices on
  Unix. In all other cases, this field is zero.

- **`inode = ` `t:non_neg_integer/0`** - Gives the `inode` number. On non-Unix file
  systems, this field is zero.

- **`uid = ` `t:non_neg_integer/0`** - Indicates the owner of the file. On non-Unix file
  systems, this field is zero.

- **`gid = ` `t:non_neg_integer/0`** - Gives the group that the owner of the file
  belongs to. On non-Unix file systems, this field is zero.

Typical error reasons:

- **`eacces`** - Missing search permission for one of the parent directories of
  the file.

- **`enoent`** - The file does not exist.

- **`enotdir`** - A component of the filename is not a directory. On some
  platforms, `enoent` is returned instead.

Opens file `File` in the mode determined by `Modes`, which can contain one or
more of the following options:

- **`read`** - The file, which must exist, is opened for reading.

- **`write`** - The file is opened for writing. It is created if it does not
  exist. If the file exists and `write` is not combined with `read`, the file is
  truncated.

- **`append`** - The file is opened for writing. It is created if it does not
  exist. Every write operation to a file opened with `append` takes place at the
  end of the file.

- **`exclusive`** - The file is opened for writing. It is created if it does not
  exist. If the file exists, `{error, eexist}` is returned.

  > #### Warning {: .warning }
  >
  > This option does not guarantee exclusiveness on file systems not supporting
  > `O_EXCL` properly, such as NFS. Do not depend on this option unless you know
  > that the file system supports it (in general, local file systems are safe).

- **`raw`** - [](){: #raw } Allows faster access to a file, as no Erlang process
  is needed to handle the file. However, a file opened in this way has the
  following limitations:

  - The functions in the `io` module cannot be used, as they can only talk to an
    Erlang process. Instead, use functions `read/2`, `read_line/1`, and
    `write/2`.
  - Especially if [`read_line/1`](`read_line/1`) is to be used on a `raw` file,
    it is recommended to combine this option with option `{read_ahead, Size}` as
    line-oriented I/O is inefficient without buffering.
  - Only the Erlang process that opened the file can use it.
  - A remote Erlang file server cannot be used. The computer on which the Erlang
    node is running must have access to the file system (directly or through
    NFS).

- **`binary`** - Read operations on the file return binaries rather than lists.

- **`{delayed_write, Size, Delay}`** - Data in subsequent [`write/2`](`write/2`)
  calls is buffered until at least `Size` bytes are buffered, or until the
  oldest buffered data is `Delay` milliseconds old. Then all buffered data is
  written in one operating system call. The buffered data is also flushed before
  some other file operation than [`write/2`](`write/2`) is executed.

  The purpose of this option is to increase performance by reducing the number
  of operating system calls. Thus, the [`write/2`](`write/2`) calls must be for
  sizes significantly less than `Size`, and not interspersed by too many other
  file operations.

  When this option is used, the result of [`write/2`](`write/2`) calls can
  prematurely be reported as successful, and if a write error occurs, the error
  is reported as the result of the next file operation, which is not executed.

  For example, when `delayed_write` is used, after a number of
  [`write/2`](`write/2`) calls, [`close/1`](`close/1`) can return
  `{error, enospc}`, as there is not enough space on the disc for previously
  written data. [`close/1`](`close/1`) must probably be called again, as the
  file is still open.

- **`delayed_write`** - The same as `{delayed_write, Size, Delay}` with
  reasonable default values for `Size` and `Delay` (roughly some 64 KB, 2
  seconds).

- **`{read_ahead, Size}`** - Activates read data buffering. If
  [`read/2`](`read/2`) calls are for significantly less than `Size` bytes, read
  operations to the operating system are still performed for blocks of `Size`
  bytes. The extra data is buffered and returned in subsequent
  [`read/2`](`read/2`) calls, giving a performance gain as the number of
  operating system calls is reduced.

  The `read_ahead` buffer is also highly used by function
  [`read_line/1`](`read_line/1`) in `raw` mode, therefore this option is
  recommended (for performance reasons) when accessing raw files using that
  function.

  If [`read/2`](`read/2`) calls are for sizes not significantly less than, or
  even greater than `Size` bytes, no performance gain can be expected.

- **`read_ahead`** - The same as `{read_ahead, Size}` with a reasonable default
  value for `Size` (roughly some 64 KB).

- **`compressed`** - Makes it possible to read or write gzip compressed files.
  Option `compressed` must be combined with `read` or `write`, but not both.
  Notice that the file size obtained with `read_file_info/1` does probably not
  match the number of bytes that can be read from a compressed file.

- **`compressed_one`** - Read one member of a gzip compressed file. Option
  `compressed_one` can only be combined with `read`.

- **`{encoding, Encoding}`** - Makes the file perform automatic translation of
  characters to and from a specific (Unicode) encoding. Notice that the data
  supplied to `write/2` or returned by `read/2` still is byte-oriented; this
  option denotes only how data is stored in the disk file.

  Depending on the encoding, different methods of reading and writing data is
  preferred. The default encoding of `latin1` implies using this module (`file`)
  for reading and writing data as the interfaces provided here work with
  byte-oriented data. Using other (Unicode) encodings makes the `m:io` functions
  `get_chars`, `get_line`, and `put_chars` more suitable, as they can work with
  the full Unicode range.

  If data is sent to an `t:io_device/0` in a format that cannot be converted to
  the specified encoding, or if data is read by a function that returns data in
  a format that cannot cope with the character range of the data, an error
  occurs and the file is closed.

  Allowed values for `Encoding`:

  - **`latin1`** - The default encoding. Bytes supplied to the file, that is,
    `write/2` are written "as is" on the file. Likewise, bytes read from the
    file, that is, `read/2` are returned "as is". If module `m:io` is used for
    writing, the file can only cope with Unicode characters up to code point 255
    (the ISO Latin-1 range).

  - **`unicode or utf8`** - Characters are translated to and from UTF-8 encoding
    before they are written to or read from the file. A file opened in this way
    can be readable using function `read/2`, as long as no data stored on the
    file lies beyond the ISO Latin-1 range (0..255), but failure occurs if the
    data contains Unicode code points beyond that range. The file is best read
    with the functions in the Unicode aware module `m:io`.

    Bytes written to the file by any means are translated to UTF-8 encoding
    before being stored on the disk file.

  - **`utf16 or {utf16,big}`** - Works like `unicode`, but translation is done
    to and from big endian UTF-16 instead of UTF-8.

  - **`{utf16,little}`** - Works like `unicode`, but translation is done to and
    from little endian UTF-16 instead of UTF-8.

  - **`utf32 or {utf32,big}`** - Works like `unicode`, but translation is done
    to and from big endian UTF-32 instead of UTF-8.

  - **`{utf32,little}`** - Works like `unicode`, but translation is done to and
    from little endian UTF-32 instead of UTF-8.

  The Encoding can be changed for a file "on the fly" by using function
  `io:setopts/2`. So a file can be analyzed in latin1 encoding for, for example,
  a BOM, positioned beyond the BOM and then be set for the right encoding before
  further reading. For functions identifying BOMs, see module `m:unicode`.

  This option is not allowed on `raw` files.

- **`ram`** - `File` must be `t:iodata/0`. Returns an `t:fd/0`, which lets
  module `file` operate on the data in-memory as if it is a file.

- **`sync`** - On platforms supporting it, enables the POSIX `O_SYNC`
  synchronous I/O flag or its platform-dependent equivalent (for example,
  `FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH` on Windows) so that writes to the file block until
  the data is physically written to disk. However, be aware that the exact
  semantics of this flag differ from platform to platform. For example, none of
  Linux or Windows guarantees that all file metadata are also written before the
  call returns. For precise semantics, check the details of your platform
  documentation. On platforms with no support for POSIX `O_SYNC` or equivalent,
  use of the `sync` flag causes `open` to return `{error, enotsup}`.

- **`directory`** - Allows `open` to work on directories.

Returns:

- **`{ok, IoDevice}`** - The file is opened in the requested mode. `IoDevice` is
  a reference to the file.

- **`{error, Reason}`** - The file cannot be opened.

`IoDevice` is really the pid of the process that handles the file. This process
monitors the process that originally opened the file (the owner process). If the
owner process terminates, the file is closed and the process itself terminates
too. An `IoDevice` returned from this call can be used as an argument to the I/O
functions (see `m:io`).

Typical error reasons:

- **`enoent`** - The file does not exist.

- **`eacces`** - Missing permission for reading the file or searching one of the
  parent directories.

- **`eisdir`** - The named file is a directory.

- **`enotdir`** - A component of the filename is not a directory, or the
  filename itself is not a directory if `directory` mode was specified. On some
  platforms, `enoent` is returned instead.

- **`enospc`** - There is no space left on the device (if `write` access was
  specified).

Reads `Number` bytes/characters from the file referenced by `IoDevice`.

The functions `read/2`, `pread/3`, and `read_line/1` are the only ways to read from
a file opened in `raw` mode (although they work for normally opened files, too).

For files where `encoding` is set to something else than `latin1`, one character
can be represented by more than one byte on the file. The parameter `Number`
always denotes the number of _characters_ read from the file, while the position
in the file can be moved much more than this number when reading a Unicode file.

Reads a line of bytes/characters from the file referenced by `IoDevice`.

Lines are defined to be delimited by the linefeed (LF, `\n`) character, but any
carriage return (CR, `\r`) followed by a newline is also treated as a single LF
character (the carriage return is silently ignored). The line is returned
_including_ the LF, but excluding any CR immediately followed by an LF. This
behaviour is consistent with the behaviour of `io:get_line/2`. If end of file is
reached without any LF ending the last line, a line with no trailing LF is
returned.

The function can be used on files opened in `raw` mode. However, it is
inefficient to use it on `raw` files if the file is not opened with option
`{read_ahead, Size}` specified. Thus, combining `raw` and `{read_ahead, Size}`
is highly recommended when opening a text file for raw line-oriented reading.

Copies `ByteCount` bytes from `Source` to `Destination`. `Source` and

[`open/2`](`open/2`).

Argument `Modes` is a list of possible modes, see `open/2`, and defaults to
`[]`.

If both `Source` and `Destination` refer to filenames, the files are opened with
`[read, binary]` and `[write, binary]` prepended to their mode lists,
respectively, to optimize the copy.

If `Source` refers to a filename, it is opened with `read` mode prepended to the
mode list before the copy, and closed when done.

If `Destination` refers to a filename, it is opened with `write` mode prepended
to the mode list before the copy, and closed when done.

Returns `{ok, BytesCopied}`, where `BytesCopied` is the number of bytes that was
copied, which can be less than `ByteCount` if end of file was encountered on the
source. If the operation fails, `{error, Reason}` is returned.
