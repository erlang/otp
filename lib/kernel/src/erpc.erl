Enhanced Remote Procedure Call

This module provide services similar to Remote Procedure Calls. A remote
procedure call is a method to call a function on a remote node and collect the
answer. It is used for collecting information on a remote node, or for running a
function with some specific side effects on the remote node.

This is an enhanced subset of the operations provided by the `m:rpc` module.
Enhanced in the sense that it makes it possible to distinguish between returned
value, raised exceptions, and other errors. `erpc` also has better performance
and scalability than the original `rpc` implementation. However, current `rpc`
module will utilize `erpc` in order to also provide these properties when
possible.

In order for an `erpc` operation to succeed, the remote node also needs to
support `erpc`. Typically only ordinary Erlang nodes as of OTP 23 have `erpc`
support.

Note that it is up to the user to ensure that correct code to execute via `erpc`
is available on the involved nodes.

Evaluates [`apply(Module, Function, Args)`](`apply/3`) on node `Node` and
returns the corresponding value `Result`. `Timeout` sets an upper time limit for
the `call` operation to complete.

The `call()` function only returns if the applied function successfully returned
without raising any uncaught exceptions, the operation did not time out, and no
failures occurred. In all other cases an exception is raised. The following
exceptions, listed by exception class, can currently be raised by `call()`:

- **`throw`** - The applied function called [`throw(Value)`](`throw/1`) and did
  not catch this exception. The exception reason `Value` equals the argument
  passed to [`throw/1`](`throw/1`).

- **`exit`** - Exception reason:

  - **`{exception, ExitReason}`** - The applied function called
    [`exit(ExitReason)`](`exit/1`) and did not catch this exception. The exit
    reason `ExitReason` equals the argument passed to [`exit/1`](`exit/1`).

  - **`{signal, ExitReason}`** - The process that applied the function received
    an exit signal and terminated due to this signal. The process terminated
    with exit reason `ExitReason`.

- **`error`** - Exception reason:

  - **`{exception, ErrorReason, StackTrace}`** - A runtime error occurred which
    raised an error exception while applying the function, and the applied
    function did not catch the exception. The error reason `ErrorReason`
    indicates the type of error that occurred. `StackTrace` is formatted as when
    caught in a `try/catch` construct. The `StackTrace` is limited to the
    applied function and functions called by it.

  - **`{erpc, ERpcErrorReason}`** - The `erpc` operation failed. The following
    `ERpcErrorReason`s are the most common ones:

    - **`badarg`** - If any one of these are true:

      - `Node` is not an atom.
      - `Module` is not an atom.
      - `Function` is not an atom.
      - `Args` is not a list. Note that the list is not verified to be a proper
        list at the client side.
      - `Timeout` is invalid.

    - **`noconnection`** - The connection to `Node` was lost or could not be
      established. The function may or may not be applied.

    - **`system_limit`** - The `erpc` operation failed due to some system limit
      being reached. This typically due to failure to create a process on the
      remote node `Node`, but can be other things as well.

    - **`timeout`** - The `erpc` operation timed out. The function may or may
      not be applied.

    - **`notsup`** - The remote node `Node` does not support this `erpc`
      operation.

If the `erpc` operation fails, but it is unknown if the function is/will be
applied (that is, a timeout or a connection loss), the caller will not receive
any further information about the result if/when the applied function completes.
If the applied function explicitly communicates with the calling process, such
communication may, of course, reach the calling process.

Receive a response to a `call` request corresponding to a request identifier
saved in `RequestIdCollection`. All request identifiers of `RequestIdCollection`
must correspond to requests that have been made using `send_request/4` or
`send_request/6`, and all requests must have been made by the process calling
this function.

`Label` is the label associated with the request identifier of the request that
the response corresponds to. A request identifier is associated with a label
when [adding a request identifier](`reqids_add/3`) in a
[request identifier collection](`t:request_id_collection/0`), or when sending
the request using `send_request/6`.

Compared to `receive_response/2`, the returned result associated with a specific
request identifier or an exception associated with a specific request identifier
will be wrapped in a 3-tuple. The first element of this tuple equals the value
that would have been produced by [`receive_response/2`](`receive_response/2`),
the second element equals the `Label` associated with the specific request
identifier, and the third element `NewRequestIdCollection` is a possibly
modified request identifier collection. The `error` exceptions `{erpc, badarg}`
and `{erpc, timeout}` are not associated with any specific request identifiers,
and will hence not be wrapped.

If `RequestIdCollection` is empty, the atom `no_request` will be returned.

If the operation times out, all requests identified by `RequestIdCollection`
will be abandoned, then an `{erpc, timeout}` `error` exception will be raised.
That is, no responses corresponding to any of the request identifiers in
`RequestIdCollection` will ever be received after a timeout. The difference
between [`receive_response/3`](`receive_response/3`) and `wait_response/3` is
that [`receive_response/3`](`receive_response/3`) abandons the requests at
timeout so that any potential future responses are ignored, while
[`wait_response/3`](`wait_response/3`) does not.

If `Delete` equals `true`, the association with `Label` will have been deleted
from `RequestIdCollection` in the resulting `NewRequestIdCollection`. If
`Delete` equals `false`, `NewRequestIdCollection` will equal
`RequestIdCollection`. Note that deleting an association is not for free and
that a collection containing already handled requests can still be used by
subsequent calls to [`receive_response/3`](`receive_response/3`),
`check_response/3`, and `wait_response/3`. However, without deleting handled
associations, the above calls will not be able to detect when there are no more
outstanding requests to handle, so you will have to keep track of this some

placed at the same position as the node name is placed in `Nodes`. Each item in
