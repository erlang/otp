-module(erl_debugger).
-moduledoc """
Erlang debugger support (EXPERIMENTAL).

This module exposes low-level functionality for the implementation
of a debugger for Erlang.

Any local process can register itself as the debugger for a node, but
there can be at most one such process registered at any given time.
Using the BIFs in this module, a debugger can:

  - set breakpoints;
  - get notified on debugger events such as a process hitting a breakpoint;
  - resume processes paused on breakpoints

At the moment, the API is highly experimental; so don't depend on it,
or otherwise expect frequent incompatible changes.

%% Types

Debugger session identifier.

It is attached to all debugger events.

The debugger process will receive debugger-event messages, wrapped in
an envelope of this type.

-doc """
Debugger events.

Here are the possible events:

  * `{breakpoint, Pid, {M,F,A}, Line, Resume}`: process Pid hit a breakpoint
    on module `M`, at the given `Line`. The debugger can resume the process
    by executing `Resume()`.

Debugging instrumentations that can be applied on module loading.

     of executable lines

Returns `true` if the emulator supports debugging.

The debugger can only be used if the `+D` argument was passed
to the emulator on start-up.

Modules that are already loaded may have had a different set of
instrumentations applied.

Updates the instrumentations that will be applied on module loading.

had at their time of loading.

%% Registration

-doc """
Register the given process as the debugger.

If the registration succeeds, it returns `{ok, Session}`, where `Session`
is a token that will be included in every message sent to the process.

Returns `{error, already_exists}` if some process is currently
registered as debugger.

%% Breakpoints

-doc """
Sets or clear a breakpoint on the given Module/Line.

When a process hits a breakpoint, it will pause and a `breakpoint`
message is sent to the registered debugger.

Returns `ok` on success. It can fail with the following reasons:
  - `{badkey, Module}`: The given module is not loaded.
  - `{unsupported, Module}`: The module was loaded without support
    for line breakpoints.
  - `{badkey, Line}`: The line is not relevant; it could refer to a comment,
     not existing in the module source, and so on.
  - `{unsupported, Line}`: It is not possible to set a breakpoint in
    in the given line; for example, if it refers to a function head.
