Interface to TCP/IP sockets.

This module provides functions for communicating over TCP/IP
protocol sockets.

The following code fragment is a simple example of a client connecting to a
server at port 5678, transferring a binary, and closing the connection:

```erlang
client() ->
    SomeHostInNet = "localhost", % to make it runnable on one machine
    {ok, Sock} = gen_tcp:connect(SomeHostInNet, 5678,
                                 [binary, {packet, 0}]),
    ok = gen_tcp:send(Sock, "Some Data"),
    ok = gen_tcp:close(Sock).
```

At the other end, a server is listening on port 5678, accepts the connection,
and receives the binary:

```erlang
server() ->
    {ok, LSock} = gen_tcp:listen(5678, [binary, {packet, 0},
                                        {active, false}]),
    {ok, Sock} = gen_tcp:accept(LSock),
    {ok, Bin} = do_recv(Sock, []),
    ok = gen_tcp:close(Sock),
    ok = gen_tcp:close(LSock),
    Bin.

do_recv(Sock, Bs) ->
    case gen_tcp:recv(Sock, 0) of
        {ok, B} ->
            do_recv(Sock, [Bs, B]);
        {error, closed} ->
            {ok, list_to_binary(Bs)}
    end.
```

> Functions that create sockets can take an optional option;
> `{inet_backend, Backend}` that, if specified, has to be the first option. This
> selects the implementation backend towards the platform's socket API.
>
> This is a _temporary_ option that will be ignored in a future release.
>
> The default is `Backend = inet` that selects the traditional `inet_drv.c`
> driver. The other choice is `Backend = socket` that selects the new `m:socket`
> module and its NIF implementation.
>
> The system default can be changed when the node is started with the
> application `kernel`'s configuration variable `inet_backend`.
>
> For `gen_tcp` with `inet_backend = socket` we have tried to be as "compatible"
> as possible which has sometimes been impossible. Here is a list of cases when
> the behaviour of inet-backend `inet` (default) and `socket` are different:
>
> - [Non-blocking send](#non_blocking_send)
>
>   If a user calling [`gen_tcp:send/2`](`send/2`) with `inet_backend = inet`,
>   tries to send more data than there is room for in the OS buffers, the "rest
>   data" is buffered by the inet driver (and later sent in the background). The
>   effect for the user is that the call is non-blocking.
>
>   This is _not_ the effect when `inet_backend = socket`, since there is no
>   buffering. Instead the user hangs either until all data has been sent or the
>   `send_timeout` timeout has been reached.
>
> - `shutdown/2` may hide errors
>
>   The call does not involve the receive process state, and is done
>   right on the underlying socket.  On for example Linux, it is a known
>   misbehaviour that it skips some checks so doing shutdown on a
>   listen socket returns `ok` while the logical result should have been
>   `{error, enotconn}`.  The `inet_drv.c` driver did an extra check
>   and simulated the correct error, but with `Backend = socket`
>   it would introduce overhead to involve the receive process.
>
> - The option [nodelay](`m:inet#option-nodelay`) is a TCP specific option that
>   is _not_ compatible with `domain = local`.
>
>   When using `inet_backend = socket`, trying to create a socket (via listen or
>   connect) with `domain = local` (for example with option \{ifaddr,
>   \{local,"/tmp/test"\}\}) _will fail_ with `{error, enotsup}`.
>
>   This does not actually work for `inet_backend = inet` either, but in that
>   case the error is simply _ignored_, which is a _bad_ idea. We have chosen to
>   _not_ ignore this error for `inet_backend = socket`.
>
> - [Async shutdown write](#async_shutdown_write)
>
>   Calling [gen_tcp:shutdown(Socket, write | read_write)](`shutdown/2`) on a
>   socket created with `inet_backend = socket` will take _immediate_ effect,
>   unlike for a socket created with `inet_backend = inet`.
>
>   See [async shutdown write](#async_shutdown_write) for more info.

## Examples

The following example illustrates use of option `{active,once}` and multiple
accepts by implementing a server as a number of worker processes doing accept on
a single listening socket. Function `start/2` takes the number of worker
processes and the port number on which to listen for incoming connections. If
`LPort` is specified as `0`, an ephemeral port number is used, which is why the
start function returns the actual port number allocated:

```erlang
start(Num,LPort) ->
    case gen_tcp:listen(LPort,[{active, false},{packet,2}]) of
        {ok, ListenSock} ->
            start_servers(Num,ListenSock),
            {ok, Port} = inet:port(ListenSock),
            Port;
        {error,Reason} ->
            {error,Reason}
    end.

start_servers(0,_) ->
    ok;
start_servers(Num,LS) ->
    spawn(?MODULE,server,[LS]),
    start_servers(Num-1,LS).

server(LS) ->
    case gen_tcp:accept(LS) of
        {ok,S} ->
            loop(S),
            server(LS);
        Other ->
            io:format("accept returned ~w - goodbye!~n",[Other]),
            ok
    end.

loop(S) ->
    inet:setopts(S,[{active,once}]),
    receive
        {tcp,S,Data} ->
            Answer = process(Data), % Not implemented in this example
            gen_tcp:send(S,Answer),
            loop(S);
        {tcp_closed,S} ->
            io:format("Socket ~w closed [~w]~n",[S,self()]),
            ok
    end.
```

Example of a simple client:

```erlang
client(PortNo,Message) ->
    {ok,Sock} = gen_tcp:connect("localhost",PortNo,[{active,false},
                                                    {packet,2}]),
    gen_tcp:send(Sock,Message),
    A = gen_tcp:recv(Sock,0),
    gen_tcp:close(Sock),
    A.
```

The `send` call does not accept a time-out option because time-outs on send is
handled through socket option `send_timeout`. The behavior of a send operation
with no receiver is mainly defined by the underlying TCP stack and the network
infrastructure. To write code that handles a hanging receiver that can
eventually cause the sender to hang on a `send` do like the following.

Consider a process that receives data from a client process to be forwarded to a
server on the network. The process is connected to the server through TCP/IP and
does not get any acknowledge for each message it sends, but has to rely on the
send time-out option to detect that the other end is unresponsive. Option
`send_timeout` can be used when connecting:

```erlang
...
{ok,Sock} = gen_tcp:connect(HostAddress, Port,
                            [{active,false},
                             {send_timeout, 5000},
                             {packet,2}]),
                loop(Sock), % See below
...
```

In the loop where requests are handled, send time-outs can now be detected:

```erlang
loop(Sock) ->
    receive
        {Client, send_data, Binary} ->
            case gen_tcp:send(Sock,[Binary]) of
                {error, timeout} ->
                    io:format("Send timeout, closing!~n",
                              []),
                    handle_send_timeout(), % Not implemented here
                    Client ! {self(),{error_sending, timeout}},
                    %% Usually, it's a good idea to give up in case of a
                    %% send timeout, as you never know how much actually
                    %% reached the server, maybe only a packet header?!
                    gen_tcp:close(Sock);
                {error, OtherSendError} ->
                    io:format("Some other error on socket (~p), closing",
                              [OtherSendError]),
                    Client ! {self(),{error_sending, OtherSendError}},
                    gen_tcp:close(Sock);
                ok ->
                    Client ! {self(), data_sent},
                    loop(Sock)
            end
    end.
```

Usually it suffices to detect time-outs on receive, as most protocols include
some sort of acknowledgment from the server, but if the protocol is strictly one
way, option `send_timeout` comes in handy.

-doc """
Create a socket connected to the specified address.

Creates a socket and connects it to a server on TCP port `Port`
on the host with IP address `Address`, that may also be a hostname.

### `Opts` (connect options)

- **`{ip, Address}`** - If the local host has many IP addresses,
  this option specifies which one to use.

- **`{ifaddr, Address}`** - Same as `{ip, Address}`.

  However, if `Address` instead is a `t:socket:sockaddr_in/0` or
  `t:socket:sockaddr_in6/0` this takes precedence over any value
  previously set with the `ip` and `port` options. If these options
  (`ip` or/and `port`) however comes _after_ this option,
  they may be used to _update_ the corresponding fields of this option
  (for `ip`, the `addr` field, and for `port`, the `port` field).

- **`{fd, integer() >= 0}`** - If a socket has somehow been connected without
  using `gen_tcp`, use this option to pass the file descriptor for it.
  If `{ip, Address}` and/or `{port, port_number()}` is combined
  with this option, the `fd` is bound to the specified interface
  and port before connecting. If these options are not specified,
  it is assumed that the `fd` is already bound appropriately.

- **`inet`** - Sets up the socket for IPv4.

- **`inet6`** - Sets up the socket for IPv6.

- **`local`** - Sets up a Unix Domain Socket. See `t:inet:local_address/0`

- **`{port, Port}`** - Specifies which local port number to use.

- **`{tcp_module, module()}`** - Overrides which callback module is used.
  Defaults to `inet_tcp` for IPv4 and `inet6_tcp` for IPv6.

- **`t:option/0`** - See `inet:setopts/2`.

### Socket Data

Packets can be sent to the peer (outbound) with
[`send(Socket, Packet)`](`send/2`).  Packets sent from the peer
(inbound) are delivered as messages to the socket owner;
the process that created the socket, unless `{active, false}`
is specified in the `Options` list.

#### Active mode socket messages

- **`{tcp, Socket, Data}`** - Inbound data from the socket.

- **`{tcp_passive, Socket}`** -
  The socket was in `{active, N}` mode (see `inet:setopts/2` for details)
  and its message counter reached `0`, indicating that
  the socket has transitioned to passive (`{active, false}`) mode.


- **`{tcp_closed, Socket}`** - The socket was closed.

- **`{tcp_error, Socket, Reason}`** A socket error occurred.

#### Passive mode

If `{active, false}` is specified in the option list for the socket,
packets and errors are retrieved by calling [`recv/2,3`](`recv/3`)
(`send/2` may also return errors).

#### Timeout

The optional `Timeout` parameter specifies a connect time-out in milliseconds.
Defaults to `infinity`.

> #### Note {: .info }
>
> Keep in mind that if the underlying OS `connect()` call returns a timeout,
> `gen_tcp:connect` will also return a timeout (i.e. `{error, etimedout}`),
> even if a larger `Timeout` was specified (for example `infinity`).

> #### Note {: .info }

%% Listen on a tcp port
%%

-doc """
Create a listen socket.

Creates a socket and sets it to listen on port `Port` on the local host.

If `Port == 0`, the underlying OS assigns an available (ephemeral)
port number, use `inet:port/1` to retrieve it.

The following options are available:

- **`list`** - Received `Packet`s are delivered as lists of bytes,
  `[`[`byte/0`](`t:byte/0`)`]`.

- **`binary`** - Received `Packet`s are delivered as `t:binary/0`s.

- **`{backlog, B}`** - `B ::` `t:non_neg_integer/0`. The backlog value
  defines the maximum length that the queue of pending connections
  can grow to. Defaults to `5`.

- **`inet6`** - Sets up the socket for IPv6.

- **`inet`** - Sets up the socket for IPv4.

- **`{fd, Fd}`** - If a socket has somehow been created without using
  `gen_tcp`, use this option to pass the file descriptor for it.

- **`{ip, Address}`** - If the host has many IP addresses, this option
  specifies which one to listen on.

- **`{port, Port}`** - Specifies which local port number to use.

- **`{ifaddr, Address}`** - Same as `{ip, Address}`.

  However, if this instead is an `t:socket:sockaddr_in/0` or
  `t:socket:sockaddr_in6/0` this takes precedence over any value
  previously set with the `ip` and `port` options. If these options
  (`ip` or/and `port`) however comes _after_ this option,
  they may be used to _update_ their corresponding fields of this option
  (for `ip`, the `addr` field, and for `port`, the `port` field).

- **`{tcp_module, module()}`** - Overrides which callback module is used.
  Defaults to `inet_tcp` for IPv4 and `inet6_tcp` for IPv6.

- **`t:option/0`** - See `inet:setopts/2`.

The returned socket `ListenSocket` should be used when calling
[`accept/1,2`](`accept/1`) to accept an incoming connection request.

Close a TCP socket.

Note that in most implementations of TCP, doing a `close` does not guarantee
that the data sent is delivered to the recipient.  It is guaranteed that
the recepient will see all sent data before getting the close, but the
sender gets no indication of that.

If the sender needs to know that the recepient has received all data
there are two common ways to achieve this:

1. Use [`gen_tcp:shutdown(Sock, write)`](`shutdown/2`) to signal that no more
   data is to be sent and wait for the other side to acknowledge seeing
   its read side being closed, by closing its write side, which shows
   as a socket close on this side.
2. Implement an acknowledgement in the protocol on top of TCP
   that both connection ends adhere to, indicating that all data
   has been seen.  The socket option [`{packet, N}`](`m:inet#option-packet`)
   may be useful.

If the socket is not in passive mode, the return value is `{error, einval}`.

Argument `Length` is only meaningful when the socket is in `raw` mode and
denotes the number of bytes to read.  If `Length` is `0`, all available
bytes are returned. If `Length > 0`, exactly `Length` bytes are returned,

the controlling process of the socket. However, only one process can call this
