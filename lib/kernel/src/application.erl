Generic OTP application functions

In OTP, _application_ denotes a component implementing some specific
functionality, that can be started and stopped as a unit, and that can be reused
in other systems. This module interacts with _application controller_, a process
started at every Erlang runtime system. This module contains functions for
controlling applications (for example, starting and stopping applications), and
functions to access information about applications (for example, configuration
parameters).

An application is defined by an _application specification_. The specification
is normally located in an _application resource file_ named `Application.app`,
where `Application` is the application name. For details about the application
specification, see [`app`](app.md).

This module can also be viewed as a behaviour for an application implemented
according to the OTP design principles as a supervision tree. The definition of
how to start and stop the tree is to be located in an _application callback
module_, exporting a predefined set of functions.

For details about applications and behaviours, see
[OTP Design Principles](`e:system:design_principles.md`).

This function is called whenever an application is started using `start/1,2`,

structured according to the OTP design principles as a supervision tree, this
means starting the top supervisor of the tree.

- `normal` if it is a normal startup.
- `normal` also if the application is distributed and started at the current
  node because of a failover from another node, and the application
  specification key `start_phases == undefined`.
- `{takeover,Node}` if the application is distributed and started at the current
  node because of a takeover from `Node`, either because

  higher priority than `Node`.

  node because of a failover from `Node`, and the application specification key

Loads the application specification for an application into the application

The application can be specified by its name `Application`. In this case, the
application controller searches the code path for the application resource file
`Application.app` and loads the specification it contains.

The application specification can also be specified directly as a tuple
`AppSpec`, having the format and contents as described in [`app`](app.md).

If `Distributed == {Application,[Time,]Nodes}`, the application becomes
distributed. The argument overrides the value for the application in the Kernel
configuration parameter `distributed`. `Application` must be the application
name (same as in the first argument). If a node crashes and `Time` is specified,
the application controller waits for `Time` milliseconds before attempting to
restart the application on another node. If `Time` is not specified, it defaults
to `0` and the application is restarted immediately.

`Nodes` is a list of node names where the application can run, in priority from
left to right. Node names can be grouped using tuples to indicate that they have
the same priority.

_Example:_

```erlang
Nodes = [cp1@cave, {cp2@cave, cp3@cave}]

This means that the application is preferably to be started at `cp1@cave`. If

`Applications` is either an an `t:atom/0` or a list of `t:atom/0` representing

This function is equivalent to calling [`start/1,2`](`start/1`) repeatedly on
all dependencies that are not yet started of each application. Optional
dependencies will also be loaded and started if they are available.

The `Mode` argument controls if the applications should be started in `serial`
mode (one at a time) or `concurrent` mode. In concurrent mode, a dependency
graph is built and the leaves of the graph are started concurrently and
recursively. In both modes, no assertion can be made about the order the
applications are started. If not supplied, it defaults to `serial`.

Returns `{ok, AppNames}` for a successful start or for an already started
application (which is, however, omitted from the `AppNames` list).

The function reports `{error, {AppName,Reason}}` for errors, where `Reason` is
any possible reason returned by [`start/1,2`](`start/1`) when starting a
specific dependency.

Starts `Application`. If it is not loaded, the application controller first
loads it using [`load/1`](`load/1`). It ensures that any included applications
are loaded, but does not start them. That is assumed to be taken care of in the
code for `Application`.

The application controller checks the value of the application specification key
`applications`, to ensure that all applications needed to be started before this
application are running. If an application is missing and the application is not
marked as optional, `{error,{not_started,App}}` is returned, where `App` is the
name of the missing application. Note this function makes no attempt to start
any of the applications listed in `applications`, not even optional ones. See
[`ensure_all_started/1,2`](`ensure_all_started/1`) for recursively starting the
current application and its dependencies.

Once validated, the application controller then creates an _application master_
for the application. The application master becomes the group leader of all the
processes in the application. I/O is forwarded to the previous group leader,
though, this is just a way to identify processes that belong to the application.
Used for example to find itself from any process, or, reciprocally, to kill them
all when it terminates.

The application master starts the application by calling the application
callback function [`Module:start/2`](`c:start/2`) as defined by the application
specification key `mod`.

Argument `Type` specifies the type of the application. If omitted, it defaults
to `temporary`.

- If a permanent application terminates, all other applications and the entire
  Erlang node are also terminated.
- If a transient application terminates:
  - with `Reason == normal`, this is reported but no other applications are
    terminated.
  - abnormally, all other applications and the entire Erlang node are also
    terminated.
- If a temporary application terminates, this is reported but no other
  applications are terminated.

Notice that an application can always be stopped explicitly by calling
[`stop/1`](`stop/1`). Regardless of the type of the application, no other
applications are affected.

Notice also that the transient type is of little practical use, because when a
supervision tree terminates, the reason is set to `shutdown`, not `normal`.

Takes over the distributed application `Application`, which executes at another
node `Node`.

At the current node, the application is restarted by calling
[`Module:start({takeover,Node},StartArgs)`](`c:start/2`). `Module` and
`StartArgs` are retrieved from the loaded application specification. The
application at the other node is not stopped until the startup is completed,
that is, when [`Module:start/2`](`c:start/2`) and any calls to
[`Module:start_phase/3`](`c:start_phase/3`) have returned.

Thus, two instances of the application run simultaneously during the takeover,
so that data can be transferred from the old to the new instance. If this is not
an acceptable behavior, parts of the old instance can be shut down when the new
instance is started. However, the application cannot be stopped entirely, at
least the top supervisor must remain alive.

Changes the permission for `Application` to run at the current node. The

If the permission of a loaded, but not started, application is set to `false`,
`start` returns `ok` but the application is not started until the permission is
set to `true`.

If the permission of a running application is set to `false`, the application is
stopped. If the permission later is set to `true`, it is restarted.

If the application is distributed, setting the permission to `false` means that
the application will be started at, or moved to, another node according to how
its distribution is configured (see `load/2`).

The function does not return until the application is started, stopped, or
successfully moved to another node. However, in some cases where permission is
set to `true`, the function returns `ok` even though the application is not
started. This is true when an application cannot start because of dependencies
to other applications that are not yet started. When they are started,
`Application` is started as well.

permission can be configured using the Kernel configuration parameter
`permissions`.

Stops `Application`. The application master calls
[`Module:prep_stop/1`](`c:prep_stop/1`), if such a function is defined, and then
tells the top supervisor of the application to shut down (see `m:supervisor`).

This means that the entire supervision tree, including included applications, is
terminated in reversed start order. After the shutdown, the application master
calls [`Module:stop/1`](`c:stop/1`). `Module` is the callback module as defined
by the application specification key `mod`.

Last, the application master terminates. Notice that all processes with the
application master as group leader, that is, processes spawned from a process
belonging to the application, are also terminated.

When stopped, the application is still loaded.

To stop a distributed application, [`stop/1`](`stop/1`) must be called on all
nodes where it can execute (that is, on all nodes where it has been started).
The call to [`stop/1`](`stop/1`) on the node where the application currently
executes stops its execution. The application is not moved between nodes, as
[`stop/1`](`stop/1`) is called on the node where the application currently
executes before [`stop/1`](`stop/1`) is called on the other nodes.
