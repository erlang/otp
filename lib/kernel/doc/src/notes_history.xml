          <p>The <c>disk_log</c> module has been slightly changed for
            the purpose of reducing the risk of memory problems due
            to corrupt files. The <c>chunk</c> commands have been
            optimized by increasing the chunk size from 8 kilobytes
            to 64 kilobytes.</p>

          <p>The code server used <c>prim_file</c> for its file
            operations. This made it impossible to load code from a
            boot server. Now the code server uses <c>erl_prim_loader</c>
            for these operations instead.</p>

          <p>Native lookup (system calls) is now default resolver
            method on all platforms. Also the user inet configuration
            method has changed so that a Kernel variable, <c>inetrc</c>,
            should now be used to specify the name of the user inet
            config file (if it exists). This is all documented in the

          <p>When loading a dynamically linked in driver through
            <c>erl_ddll</c>, the server <c>ddll_server</c> that held
            the port for the driver handling shared libraries got
            the group leader of the invoking application. Later, when
            the application was terminated, it killed all processes in
            its group, also the <c>ddll_server</c>, so the driver still
            had some shared libraries loaded. Finally, when
            the <c>ddll_server</c> was restarted it assumed that all
            shared libraries its driver knew of was statically linked,
            so the dynamically linked in drivers that was loaded when
            <c>ddll_server</c> was killed could neither be loaded nor
            unloaded. This bug has now been fixed by setting the group
            leader of <c>ddll_server</c> to something harmless and more
            eternal, and by unloading all remaining dynamically linked
            in drivers when <c>ddll_server</c> starts. A race condition
            when starting <c>ddll_server</c> has also been fixed.</p>

            uncatched <c>erlang:throw/1</c>, the emulator ignored

          <p>The code server could hang if invoked early in the startup.
            For example if the emulator was started with <c>"-s file eval Filename"</c> and <c>Filename</c> contained a
            call to <c>code:add_patha/1</c> the code server accidentally
            tried to execute code in an unloaded module from inside
            the code that loaded a module - hence hangup. This bug has
            now been fixed.</p>
          <p>Note! Starting Erlang through code loading from a remote
            Erlang boot server will not work after this patch. It will
            be fixed in a later patch. Rumours has it that remote boot
            server code loading did not work before this patch either.
            It is not a commonly used feature.</p>
