  <modulesummary>Distributed Named Process Groups</modulesummary>
  <description>
    <p>This module implements process groups. Each message may be sent
      to one, some, or all members of the group.
      </p>
    <p>A group of processes can be accessed by a common name. For
      example, if there is a group named <c>foobar</c>, there can be a
      set of processes (which can be located on different nodes) which
      are all members of the group <c>foobar</c>. There are no special
      functions for sending a message to the group. Instead, client
      functions should be written with the functions
      <c>get_members/1</c> and <c>get_local_members/1</c> to find out
      which processes are members of the group. Then the message can be
      sent to one or more members of the group.
      </p>
    <p>If a member terminates, it is automatically removed from the
      group.
      </p>
    <warning>
      <p>This module is used by the <c>disk_log</c> module for
        managing distributed disk logs. The disk log names are used as
        group names, which means that some action may need to be taken
        to avoid name clashes.</p>

        <p>This is a useful dispatch function which can be used from
          client functions. It returns a process on the local node, if
          such a process exist. Otherwise, it chooses one randomly.

          function should be used from within a client function that

        <p>Starts the pg2 server. Normally, the server does not need
          to be started explicitly, as it is started dynamically if it
          is needed. This is useful during development, but in a
          target system the server should be started explicitly. Use
          configuration parameters for <c>kernel</c> for this.
