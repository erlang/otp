  <description>
    <p>Sequential tracing makes it possible to trace all messages
      resulting from one initial message. Sequential tracing is
      independent of the ordinary tracing in Erlang, which
      is controlled by the <c>erlang:trace/3</c> BIF. For more information
      about what sequential tracing is and how it can be used, see section
      <seealso marker="#whatis">Sequential Tracing</seealso>.</p>
    <p><c>seq_trace</c> provides functions that control all aspects of
      sequential tracing. There are functions for activation,
      deactivation, inspection, and for collection of the trace output.</p>

    </list>

  <section>
    <marker id="whatis"></marker>
    <title>Sequential Tracing</title>
    <p>Sequential tracing is a way to trace a sequence of messages sent
      between different local or remote processes, where the sequence
      is initiated by a single message. In short, it works as follows:</p>
    <p>Each process has a <em>trace token</em>, which can be empty or
      not empty. When not empty, the trace token can be seen as
      the tuple <c>{Label, Flags, Serial, From}</c>. The trace token is
      passed invisibly with each message.</p>
    <p>To start a sequential trace, the user must explicitly set
      the trace token in the process that will send the first message
      in a sequence.</p>
    <p>The trace token of a process is set each time the process
      matches a message in a receive statement, according to the trace
      token carried by the received message, empty or not.</p>
    <p>On each Erlang node, a process can be set as the <em>system tracer</em>.
      This process will receive trace messages each time
      a message with a trace token is sent or received (if the trace
      token flag <c>send</c> or <c>'receive'</c> is set). The system
      tracer can then print each trace event, write it to a file, or
      whatever suitable.</p>
    <note>
      <p>The system tracer only receives those trace events that
        occur locally within the Erlang node. To get the whole picture
        of a sequential trace, involving processes on many Erlang
        nodes, the output from the system tracer on each involved node
        must be merged (offline).</p>
    </note>
    <p>The following sections describe sequential tracing and its most
      fundamental concepts.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Trace Token</title>
    <p>Each process has a current trace token. Initially, the token is
      empty. When the process sends a message to another process, a
      copy of the current token is sent "invisibly" along with
      the message.</p>
    <p>The current token of a process is set in one of the following two
      ways:</p>
    <list type="bulleted">
      <item>
        <p>Explicitly by the process itself, through a call to
          <c>seq_trace:set_token/1,2</c></p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>When a message is received</p>
      </item>
    </list>
    <p>In both cases, the current token is set. In particular, if
      the token of a received message is empty, the current token of
      the process is set to empty.</p>
    <p>A trace token contains a label and a set of flags. Both
      the label and the flags are set in both alternatives above.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Serial</title>
    <p>The trace token contains a component called
      <c>serial</c>. It consists of two integers, <c>Previous</c> and
      <c>Current</c>. The purpose is to uniquely identify each traced
      event within a trace sequence, as well as to order the messages
      chronologically and in the different branches, if any.</p>
    <p>The algorithm for updating <c>Serial</c> can be described as
      follows:</p>
    <p>Let each process have two counters, <c>prev_cnt</c> and
      <c>curr_cnt</c>, both are set to <c>0</c> when a process is created.
      The counters are updated at the following occasions:</p>
    <list type="bulleted">
      <item>
        <p><em>When the process is about to send a message and the trace token
          is not empty.</em></p>
        <p>Let the serial of the trace token be <c>tprev</c> and
          <c>tcurr</c>.</p>
        <pre>
curr_cnt := curr_cnt + 1
tprev := prev_cnt
tcurr := curr_cnt</pre>
        <p>The trace token with <c>tprev</c> and <c>tcurr</c> is then
          passed along with the message.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><em>When the process calls</em> <c>seq_trace:print(Label, Info)</c>,
          <c>Label</c> <em>matches the label part of the trace token and the
          trace token print flag is <c>true</c>.</em></p>
        <p>The algorithm is the same as for send above.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><em>When a message is received and contains a non-empty trace
          token.</em></p>
        <p>The process trace token is set to the trace token from
          the message.</p>
        <p>Let the serial of the trace token be <c>tprev</c> and
          <c>tcurr</c>.</p>
        <code>
<![CDATA[if (curr_cnt < tcurr )]]>
   curr_cnt := tcurr
prev_cnt := tcurr</code>
      </item>
    </list>
    <p><c>curr_cnt</c> of a process is incremented each time
      the process is involved in a sequential trace. The counter can
      reach its limit (27 bits) if a process is very long-lived and is
      involved in much sequential tracing. If the counter overflows, the
      serial for ordering of the trace events cannot be used. To prevent
      the counter from overflowing in the middle of
      a sequential trace, function <c>seq_trace:reset_trace/0</c>
      can be called to reset <c>prev_cnt</c> and <c>curr_cnt</c> of
      all processes in the Erlang node. This function also sets all
      trace tokens in processes and their message queues to empty, and
      thus stops all ongoing sequential tracing.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Performance Considerations</title>
    <p>The performance degradation for a system that is enabled for
      sequential tracing is negligible as long as no tracing is
      activated. When tracing is activated, there is an
      extra cost for each traced message, but all other messages are
      unaffected.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Ports</title>
    <p>Sequential tracing is not performed across ports.</p>
    <p>If the user for some reason wants to pass the trace token to a
      port, this must be done manually in the code of the port
      controlling process. The port controlling processes have to check
      the appropriate sequential trace settings (as obtained from
      <c>seq_trace:get_token/1</c>) and include trace information in
      the message data sent to their respective ports.</p>
    <p>Similarly, for messages received from a port, a port controller
      has to retrieve trace-specific information, and set appropriate
      sequential trace flags through calls to
      <c>seq_trace:set_token/2</c>.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Distribution</title>
    <p>Sequential tracing between nodes is performed transparently.
      This applies to C-nodes built with <c>Erl_Interface</c> too. A C-node
      built with <c>Erl_Interface</c> only maintains one trace token, which
      means that the C-node appears as one process from
      the sequential tracing point of view.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Example of Use</title>
    <p>This example gives a rough idea of how the new
      primitives can be used and what kind of output it produces.</p>
    <p>Assume that you have an initiating process with
      <c><![CDATA[Pid == <0.30.0>]]></c> like this:</p>
    <code type="none">
-module(seqex).
-compile(export_all).

loop(Port) ->
    receive 
        {Port,Message} ->
            seq_trace:set_token(label,17),
            seq_trace:set_token('receive',true),
            seq_trace:set_token(print,true),
            seq_trace:print(17,"**** Trace Started ****"),
            call_server ! {self(),the_message};
        {ack,Ack} ->
            ok
    end,
    loop(Port).</code>
    <p>And a registered process <c>call_server</c> with
      <c><![CDATA[Pid == <0.31.0>]]></c> like this:</p>
    <code type="none">
loop() ->
    receive
        {PortController,Message} ->
            Ack = {received, Message},
            seq_trace:print(17,"We are here now"),
            PortController ! {ack,Ack}
    end,
    loop().</code>
    <p>A possible output from the system's <c>sequential_tracer</c> can be
      like this:</p>
    <pre>
17:&lt;0.30.0> Info {0,1} WITH
"**** Trace Started ****"
17:&lt;0.31.0> Received {0,2} FROM &lt;0.30.0> WITH
{&lt;0.30.0>,the_message}
17:&lt;0.31.0> Info {2,3} WITH
"We are here now"
17:&lt;0.30.0> Received {2,4} FROM &lt;0.31.0> WITH
{ack,{received,the_message}}</pre>
    <p>The implementation of a system tracer process that produces
      this printout can look like this:</p>
    <code type="none">
tracer() ->
    receive
        {seq_trace,Label,TraceInfo} ->
           print_trace(Label,TraceInfo,false);
        {seq_trace,Label,TraceInfo,Ts} ->
           print_trace(Label,TraceInfo,Ts);
        Other -> ignore
    end,
    tracer().        

print_trace(Label,TraceInfo,false) ->
    io:format("~p:",[Label]),
    print_trace(TraceInfo);
print_trace(Label,TraceInfo,Ts) ->
    io:format("~p ~p:",[Label,Ts]),
    print_trace(TraceInfo).

print_trace({print,Serial,From,_,Info}) ->
    io:format("~p Info ~p WITH~n~p~n", [From,Serial,Info]);
print_trace({'receive',Serial,From,To,Message}) ->
    io:format("~p Received ~p FROM ~p WITH~n~p~n", 
              [To,Serial,From,Message]);
print_trace({send,Serial,From,To,Message}) ->
    io:format("~p Sent ~p TO ~p WITH~n~p~n", 
              [From,Serial,To,Message]).</code>
    <p>The code that creates a process that runs this tracer function
      and sets that process as the system tracer can look like this:</p>
    <code type="none">
start() ->
    Pid = spawn(?MODULE,tracer,[]),
    seq_trace:set_system_tracer(Pid), % set Pid as the system tracer 
    ok.</code>
    <p>With a function like <c>test/0</c>, the whole example can be
      started:</p>
    <code type="none">
test() ->
    P = spawn(?MODULE, loop, [port]),
    register(call_server, spawn(?MODULE, loop, [])),
    start(),
    P ! {port,message}.</code>
