  <description>
    <p>Sequential tracing makes it possible to trace all messages
      resulting from one initial message. Sequential tracing is
      completely independent of the ordinary tracing in Erlang, which
      is controlled by the <c>erlang:trace/3</c> BIF. See the chapter
      <seealso marker="#whatis">What is Sequential Tracing</seealso>
      below for more information about what sequential tracing is and
      how it can be used.</p>
    <p><c>seq_trace</c> provides functions which control all aspects of 
      sequential tracing. There are functions for activation,
      deactivation, inspection and for collection of the trace output.</p>
    <note>
      <p>The implementation of sequential tracing is in beta status.
        This means that the programming interface still might undergo
        minor adjustments (possibly incompatible) based on feedback
        from users.</p>

    <title>Trace Messages Sent To the System Tracer</title>
    <p>The format of the messages are:</p>
    <code type="none">
{seq_trace, Label, SeqTraceInfo, TimeStamp}</code>
    <p>or</p>
    <code type="none">
{seq_trace, Label, SeqTraceInfo}</code>
    <p>depending on whether the <c>timestamp</c> flag of the trace
      token is set to <c>true</c> or <c>false</c>. Where:</p>
    <code type="none">
Label = int()
TimeStamp = {Seconds, Milliseconds, Microseconds}  
  Seconds = Milliseconds = Microseconds = int()</code>
    <p>The <c>SeqTraceInfo</c> can have the following formats:</p>
    <taglist>
      <tag><c>{send, Serial, From, To, Message}</c></tag>
      <item>
        <p>Used when a process <c>From</c> with its trace token flag
          <c>print</c> set to <c>true</c> has sent a message.</p>
      </item>
      <tag><c>{'receive', Serial, From, To, Message}</c></tag>
      <item>
        <p>Used when a process <c>To</c> receives a message with a
          trace token that has the <c>'receive'</c> flag set to
          <c>true</c>.</p>
      </item>
      <tag><c>{print, Serial, From, _, Info}</c></tag>
      <item>
        <p>Used when a process <c>From</c> has called 
          <c>seq_trace:print(Label, TraceInfo)</c> and has a trace
          token with the <c>print</c> flag set to <c>true</c> and
          <c>label</c> set to <c>Label</c>.</p>
      </item>
    </taglist>
    <p><c>Serial</c> is a tuple <c>{PreviousSerial, ThisSerial}</c>,
      where the first integer <c>PreviousSerial</c> denotes the serial
      counter passed in the last received message which carried a trace 
      token. If the process is the first one in a new sequential trace,
      <c>PreviousSerial</c> is set to the value of the process internal 
      "trace clock". The second integer <c>ThisSerial</c> is the serial
      counter that a process sets on outgoing messages and it is based
      on the process internal "trace clock" which is incremented by one
      before it is attached to the trace token in the message.</p>

    <title>What is Sequential Tracing</title>
    <p>Sequential tracing is a way to trace a sequence of messages sent
      between different local or remote processes, where the sequence
      is initiated by one single message. In short it works like this:</p>
    <p>Each process has a <em>trace token</em>, which can be empty or
      not empty. When not empty the trace token can be seen as
      the tuple <c>{Label, Flags, Serial, From}</c>. The trace token is
      passed invisibly with each message.</p>
    <p>In order to start a sequential trace the user must explicitly set
      the trace token in the process that will send the first message
      in a sequence.</p>
    <p>The trace token of a process is set each time the process
      matches a message in a receive statement, according to the trace
      token carried by the received message, empty or not.</p>
    <p>On each Erlang node a process can be set as the <em>system tracer</em>. This process will receive trace messages each time
      a message with a trace token is sent or received (if the trace
      token flag <c>send</c> or <c>'receive'</c> is set). The system
      tracer can then print each trace event, write it to a file or
      whatever suitable.</p>
    <note>
      <p>The system tracer will only receive those trace events that
        occur locally within the Erlang node. To get the whole picture
        of a sequential trace that involves processes on several Erlang
        nodes, the output from the system tracer on each involved node
        must be merged (off line).</p>
    </note>
    <p>In the following sections Sequential Tracing and its most
      fundamental concepts are described.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Trace Token</title>
    <p>Each process has a current trace token. Initially the token is
      empty. When the process sends a message to another process, a
      copy of the current token will be sent "invisibly" along with
      the message.</p>
    <p>The current token of a process is set in two ways, either</p>
    <list type="ordered">
      <item>
        <p>explicitly by the process itself, through a call to
          <c>seq_trace:set_token</c>, or</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>when a message is received.</p>
      </item>
    </list>
    <p>In both cases the current token will be set. In particular, if
      the token of a message received is empty, the current token of
      the process is set to empty.</p>
    <p>A trace token contains a label, and a set of flags. Both
      the label and the flags are set in 1 and 2 above.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Serial</title>
    <p>The trace token contains a component which is called
      <c>serial</c>. It consists of two integers <c>Previous</c> and
      <c>Current</c>. The purpose is to uniquely identify each traced
      event within a trace sequence and to order the messages
      chronologically and in the different branches if any.</p>
    <p>The algorithm for updating <c>Serial</c> can be described as
      follows:</p>
    <p>Let each process have two counters <c>prev_cnt</c> and
      <c>curr_cnt</c> which both are set to 0 when a process is created.
      The counters are updated at the following occasions:</p>
    <list type="bulleted">
      <item>
        <p><em>When the process is about to send a message and the trace token is not empty.</em></p>
        <p>Let the serial of the trace token be <c>tprev</c> and
          <c>tcurr</c>.          <br></br>
<c>curr_cnt := curr_cnt + 1</c>          <br></br>
<c>tprev := prev_cnt</c>          <br></br>
<c>tcurr := curr_cnt</c></p>
        <p>The trace token with <c>tprev</c> and <c>tcurr</c> is then
          passed along with the message.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><em>When the process calls</em><c>seq_trace:print(Label, Info)</c>, <em>Label matches the label part of the trace token and the trace token print flag is true.</em></p>
        <p>The same algorithm as for send above.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><em>When a message is received and contains a nonempty trace token.</em></p>
        <p>The process trace token is set to the trace token from
          the message.</p>
        <p>Let the serial of the trace token be <c>tprev</c> and
          <c>tcurr</c>.          <br></br>
<c><![CDATA[if (curr_cnt < tcurr )]]></c>          <br></br>

          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<c>curr_cnt := tcurr</c>          <br></br>
<c>prev_cnt := tcurr</c></p>
      </item>
    </list>
    <p>The <c>curr_cnt</c> of a process is incremented each time
      the process is involved in a sequential trace. The counter can
      reach its limit (27 bits) if a process is very long-lived and is
      involved in much sequential tracing. If the counter overflows it
      will not be possible to use the serial for ordering of the trace
      events. To prevent the counter from overflowing in the middle of
      a sequential trace the function <c>seq_trace:reset_trace/0</c>
      can be called to reset the <c>prev_cnt</c> and <c>curr_cnt</c> of
      all processes in the Erlang node. This function will also set all
      trace tokens in processes and their message queues to empty and
      will thus stop all ongoing sequential tracing.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Performance considerations</title>
    <p>The performance degradation for a system which is enabled for
      Sequential Tracing is negligible as long as no tracing is
      activated. When tracing is activated there will of course be an
      extra cost for each traced message but all other messages will be
      unaffected.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Ports</title>
    <p>Sequential tracing is not performed across ports.</p>
    <p>If the user for some reason wants to pass the trace token to a
      port this has to be done manually in the code of the port
      controlling process. The port controlling processes have to check
      the appropriate sequential trace settings (as obtained from
      <c>seq_trace:get_token/1</c> and include trace information in
      the message data sent to their respective ports.</p>
    <p>Similarly, for messages received from a port, a port controller
      has to retrieve trace specific information, and set appropriate
      sequential trace flags through calls to
      <c>seq_trace:set_token/2</c>.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Distribution</title>
    <p>Sequential tracing between nodes is performed transparently.
      This applies to C-nodes built with Erl_Interface too. A C-node
      built with Erl_Interface only maintains one trace token, which
      means that the C-node will appear as one process from
      the sequential tracing point of view.</p>
    <p>In order to be able to perform sequential tracing between
      distributed Erlang nodes, the distribution protocol has been
      extended (in a backward compatible way). An Erlang node which
      supports sequential tracing can communicate with an older
      (OTP R3B) node but messages passed within that node can of course
      not be traced.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Example of Usage</title>
    <p>The example shown here will give rough idea of how the new
      primitives can be used and what kind of output it will produce.</p>
    <p>Assume that we have an initiating process with
      <c><![CDATA[Pid == <0.30.0>]]></c> like this:</p>
    <code type="none">
-module(seqex).
-compile(export_all).

loop(Port) ->
    receive 
        {Port,Message} ->
            seq_trace:set_token(label,17),
            seq_trace:set_token('receive',true),
            seq_trace:set_token(print,true),
            seq_trace:print(17,"**** Trace Started ****"),
            call_server ! {self(),the_message};
        {ack,Ack} ->
            ok
    end,
    loop(Port).</code>
    <p>And a registered process <c>call_server</c> with
      <c><![CDATA[Pid == <0.31.0>]]></c> like this:</p>
    <code type="none">
loop() ->
    receive
        {PortController,Message} ->
            Ack = {received, Message},
            seq_trace:print(17,"We are here now"),
            PortController ! {ack,Ack}
    end,
    loop().</code>
    <p>A possible output from the system's sequential_tracer (inspired
      by AXE-10 and MD-110) could look like:</p>
    <pre>
17:&lt;0.30.0> Info {0,1} WITH
"**** Trace Started ****"
17:&lt;0.31.0> Received {0,2} FROM &lt;0.30.0> WITH
{&lt;0.30.0>,the_message}
17:&lt;0.31.0> Info {2,3} WITH
"We are here now"
17:&lt;0.30.0> Received {2,4} FROM &lt;0.31.0> WITH
{ack,{received,the_message}}</pre>
    <p>The implementation of a system tracer process that produces
      the printout above could look like this:</p>
    <code type="none">
tracer() ->
    receive
        {seq_trace,Label,TraceInfo} ->
           print_trace(Label,TraceInfo,false);
        {seq_trace,Label,TraceInfo,Ts} ->
           print_trace(Label,TraceInfo,Ts);
        Other -> ignore
    end,
    tracer().        

print_trace(Label,TraceInfo,false) ->
    io:format("~p:",[Label]),

    <p>The code that creates a process that runs the tracer function
      above and sets that process as the system tracer could look like
      this:</p>
    <code type="none">
start() ->
    Pid = spawn(?MODULE,tracer,[]),
    seq_trace:set_system_tracer(Pid), % set Pid as the system tracer 
    ok.</code>
    <p>With a function like <c>test/0</c> below the whole example can be
      started.</p>
    <code type="none">
test() ->
    P = spawn(?MODULE, loop, [port]),
    register(call_server, spawn(?MODULE, loop, [])),
    start(),
    P ! {port,message}.</code>
