  <modulesummary>A disk-based term logging facility.</modulesummary>
  <description>
    <p><c>disk_log</c> is a disk-based term logger that enables
      efficient logging of items on files.</p>
    <p>Three types of logs are supported:</p>
      <taglist>
	<tag>halt logs</tag>
	<item><p>Appends items to a single file, which size can
	be limited by the <c>disk_log</c> module.</p></item>
	<tag>wrap logs</tag>
	<item><p>Uses a sequence of wrap log files of limited size. As a
	wrap log file is filled up, further items are logged on to the next
	file in the sequence, starting all over with the first file when
	the last file is filled up.</p></item>
	<tag>rotate logs</tag>
        <item><p>Uses a sequence of rotate log files of limited size. As a
        log file is filled up, it's rotated and then compressed. There's one active
        log file and upto the configured number of compressed log files. Only externally 
        formatted logs are supported.</p></item>
      </taglist>
     <p>For efficiency reasons, items are always written to files as binaries.</p>

    <p>Two formats of the log files are supported:</p>
      <taglist>
	<tag>internal format</tag>
	<item><p>Supports automatic repair of log files that are not
	properly closed and enables efficient reading of logged items in
	<em>chunks</em> using a set of functions defined in this module.
	This is the only way to read internally formatted logs.
	An item logged to an internally formatted log must not occupy more
	than 4 GB of disk space (the size must fit in 4 bytes).</p></item>
	<tag>external format</tag>
	<item><p>Leaves it up to the user to read and interpret the logged data.
	The <c>disk_log</c> module cannot repair externally formatted logs.</p></item>
      </taglist>

    <p>For each open disk log, one process handles requests
      made to the disk log. This process is created when
      <seemfa marker="#open/1"><c>open/1</c></seemfa>
      is called, provided there exists no process handling the disk log.
      A process that opens a disk log can be an <em>owner</em>
      or an anonymous <em>user</em> of the disk log. Each owner is 
      linked to the disk log process, and an owner can close the disk log
      either explicitly (by calling <c>close/1</c> or <c>lclose/1,2</c>)
      or by terminating.</p>
      <p>Owners can subscribe to <em>notifications</em>,
      messages of the form <c>{disk_log, Node, Log, Info}</c>, which are sent
      from the disk log process when certain events occur, see 
      the functions and in particular the <c>open/1</c> option
      <seeerl marker="#notify"><c>notify</c></seeerl>.
      A log can have many owners, but a process cannot own a
      log more than once. However, the same process can open the log
      as a user more than once.</p>
      <p>For a disk log process to close its file properly and terminate,
      it must be closed by its owners and once by some non-owner process
      for each time the log was used anonymously. The users are counted
      and there must not be any users left when the disk log process terminates.
      </p>
    <p>Items can be logged <em>synchronously</em> by using functions
      <seemfa marker="#log/2"><c>log/2</c></seemfa>,
      <seemfa marker="#blog/2"><c>blog/2</c></seemfa>,
      <seemfa marker="#log_terms/2"><c>log_terms/2</c></seemfa>, and
      <seemfa marker="#blog_terms/2"><c>blog_terms/2</c></seemfa>.
      For each of these functions, the caller is put
      on hold until the items are logged (but not necessarily
      written, use <c>sync/1</c> to ensure that). By adding an <c>a</c>
      to each of the mentioned function names, we get functions that log
      items <em>asynchronously</em>. Asynchronous functions do not wait for
      the disk log process to write the items to the file, but
      return the control to the caller more or less immediately.
      </p>
    <p>When using the internal format for logs, use functions
      <seemfa marker="#log/2"><c>log/2</c></seemfa>,
      <seemfa marker="#log_terms/2"><c>log_terms/2</c></seemfa>,
      <seemfa marker="#alog/2"><c>alog/2</c></seemfa>, and
      <seemfa marker="#alog_terms/2"><c>alog_terms/2</c></seemfa>.
      These functions log one or more Erlang terms.
      By prefixing each of the functions with a <c>b</c> (for "binary"),
      we get the corresponding <c>blog()</c> functions for the external format.
      These functions log one or more chunks of bytes.
      For example, to log the string <c>"hello"</c> in ASCII format, you
      can use <c>disk_log:blog(Log, "hello")</c>, or
      <c>disk_log:blog(Log, list_to_binary("hello"))</c>. The two
      alternatives are equally efficient.</p>
      <p>The <c>blog()</c> functions can also be used for internally formatted
      logs, but in this case they must be called with binaries constructed
      with calls to
      <seemfa marker="erts:erlang#term_to_binary/1"><c>term_to_binary/1</c></seemfa>.
      There is no check to ensure
      this, it is entirely the responsibility of the caller. If these
      functions are called with binaries that do not correspond to
      Erlang terms, the
      <seemfa marker="#chunk/2"><c>chunk/2,3</c></seemfa>
      and automatic repair
      functions fail. The corresponding terms (not the binaries)
      are returned when <c>chunk/2,3</c> is called.
      </p>
    <p>An open disk log is only accessible from the node where the disk
      log process runs. All processes on the node where the disk log process
      runs can log items or otherwise change, inspect, or close the log.
      </p>
    <p>Errors are reported differently for asynchronous log attempts
      and other uses of the <c>disk_log</c> module. When used synchronously,
      this module replies with an error message, but when called
      asynchronously, this module does not know where to send
      the error message. Instead, owners subscribing to notifications
      receive an <c>error_status</c> message. 
      </p>
    <p>The <c>disk_log</c> module does not report errors to the
      <seeerl marker="error_logger"><c>error_logger</c></seeerl>
      module. It is up to the caller to decide
      whether to employ the error logger. Function
      <seemfa marker="#format_error/1"><c>format_error/1</c></seemfa>
      can be used to produce readable messages from error replies.
      However, information events are sent to the error logger in two
      situations, namely when a log is repaired, or when a file is missing
      while reading chunks.
      </p>
    <p>Error message <c>no_such_log</c> means that the specified
      disk log is not open. Nothing is said about whether the disk log
      files exist or not.
      </p>
    <note>
      <p>If an attempt to reopen or truncate a log fails (see
        <seemfa marker="#reopen/2"><c>reopen/2,3</c></seemfa>
	and
	<seemfa marker="#truncate/1"><c>truncate/1,2</c></seemfa>)
	the disk log process terminates immediately. Before the process
	terminates, links to owners and blocking processes (see
	<seemfa marker="#block/1"><c>block/1,2</c></seemfa>) are removed.
        The effect is that the links work in one direction only. Any
        process using a disk log must check for error message
        <c>no_such_log</c> if some other process truncates or
        reopens the log simultaneously.</p>

        <p>With a call to <c>block/1,2</c> a process can block a log.
          If the blocking process is not an owner of the log, a temporary

        <p>Changes the size of an open log.
          For a halt log, the size can always be increased,
          but it cannot be decreased to something less than
          the current file size.
          </p>
        <p>For a wrap or rotate log, both the size and the number of files can 
          always be increased, as long as the number of files does not
          exceed 65000. If the maximum number of files is decreased, the
          change is not valid until the current file is full and the
          log wraps to the next file.
          The redundant files are removed the next time the log wraps around,
          that is, starts to log to file number 1.
          </p>
        <p>As an example, assume that the old maximum number of files 
          is 10 and that the new maximum number of files is 6. If 
          the current file number is not greater than the new maximum number 
          of files, files 7-10 are removed when file 6
          is full and the log starts to write to file number 1 again. 
          Otherwise, the files greater than the current
          file are removed when the current file is full (for example, if
          the current file is 8, files 9 and 10 are removed). The files between
          the new maximum number of files and the current
          file (that is, files 7 and 8) are removed the next time file 6
          is full.
          </p>
        <p>If the size of the files is decreased, the change immediately
          affects the current log. It does not change the
          size of log files already full until the next time they are used.
          </p>
        <p>If the log size is decreased, for example, to save space,
          function
	  <seemfa marker="#inc_wrap_file/1"><c>inc_wrap_file/1</c></seemfa>,
	  <seemfa marker="#inc_rot_file/1"><c>inc_rot_file/1</c></seemfa>

        <p><c>chunk()</c> returns a tuple

          another continuation, which must be passed on to any

	  <c><anno>Badbytes</anno></c> is the number of bytes in the file found not to be
          Erlang terms in the chunk. Notice that the log is not repaired.
          When trying to read chunks from a log opened in read-write mode,
          tuple <c>{corrupt_log_file, <anno>FileName</anno>}</c> is returned if the

          </p>
        <p>When <c>chunk/2,3</c> is used with wrap logs, the returned
          continuation might not be valid in the next call to
          <c>chunk()</c>. This is because the log can wrap and delete
          the file into which the continuation points. To prevent this,

            <p>Log size.</p>
              <p>When a halt log has reached its maximum size, all attempts to
              log more items are rejected. Defaults to
              <c>infinity</c>, which for halt implies that there is no
              maximum size.</p>
	    <p>For wrap logs, parameter <c><anno>Size</anno></c>
              can be a pair
              <c>{<anno>MaxNoBytes</anno>, <anno>MaxNoFiles</anno>}</c> or
	      <c>infinity</c>.
	      In the latter case, if the files of an existing wrap log
              with the same name can be found, the size is read
              from the existing wrap log, otherwise an error is returned.</p>
            <p>Wrap logs write at most <c><anno>MaxNoBytes</anno></c>
              bytes on each file and use <c><anno>MaxNoFiles</anno></c>
              files before starting all over with the first wrap log
              file. Regardless of <c><anno>MaxNoBytes</anno></c>,
              at least the header (if there is one) and one
              item are written on each wrap log file before
              wrapping to the next file.</p>
            <p>The first time an existing wrap log is opened, that is,
              when the disk log process is created, the value of the
              option <c>size</c> is allowed to differ from the current
              log size, and the size of the disk log is changed as per
              <seemfa
              marker="#change_size/2"><c>change_size/2</c></seemfa>.
              </p>
            <p>When opening an existing wrap log, it is not
              necessary to supply a value for option <c>size</c>,
              but if the log is already open, that is, the disk log
              process exists,
              the supplied value must equal the current log size, otherwise
              the tuple <c>{error, {size_mismatch, <anno>CurrentSize</anno>,
              <anno>NewSize</anno>}}</c> is returned.</p>
            <note>
              <p>Before Erlang/OTP 24.0, the supplied value of option
                <c>size</c> was to be equal to the current log size when
                opening an existing wrap log for the first time, that
                is, when creating the disk log process.</p>
            </note>
	    <p>When opening an already open halt log, option <c>size</c>
	      is ignored.</p>

        <p>When a disk log is opened in read-write mode, any existing

          log is created, otherwise the existing file is opened at the
          position after the last logged item, and the logging of items
          starts from there. If the format is <c>internal</c>

          formatted log, a tuple
