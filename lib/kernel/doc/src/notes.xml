	    The top directory in archive files does not need to have
	    a <c>-vsn</c> suffix anymore. For example if the archive
	    file has the name like <c>mnesia-4.4.7.ez</c> the top
	    directory in the archive can either be named
	    <c>mnesia</c> or <c>mnesia-4.4.7</c>. If the archive file
	    has a name like <c>mnesia.ez</c> the top directory in the
	    archive must be named <c>mnesia</c> as earlier.</p>

<section><title>Kernel 2.13.3</title>

    <section><title>Improvements and New Features</title>
      <list>
        <item>
	    <p> The DNS resolver client inet_res has been rewritten,
	    documented and released. See inet_res(3) and Erts User's
	    Guide: Inet configuration. </p><p> It can formally not be
	    incompatible with respect to earlier versions since there
	    was no earlier official version. However it was used
	    before and some details have changed. </p><p>
	    Configuration now initializes from /etc/resolv.conf and
	    /etc/hosts on all unix platforms regardless of which
	    distribution mode the node is started in. The directory
	    (/etc) these files are supposed to reside in can be
	    changed via an environment variable. These configuration
	    file locations can also be changed in the inet
	    configuration. The files are monitored for change and
	    re-read, which makes a few resolver configuration
	    variables out of application control. The /etc/hosts
	    entries have now their own cache table that is shadowed
	    (with lookup method 'file' is used) by the application
	    configured host entries. This problem (that inet_res
	    configuration only worked for distribution mode long
	    names) was among other reported by Matthew O'Gorman many
	    moons ago. </p><p> The lookup methods are still 'native'
	    only per default. Resolver configuration is done on all
	    Unix platforms just to get a usable configuration for
	    direct calls to inet_res. </p><p> The functions
	    <c>inet_res:nslookup/3..5</c> and
	    <c>inet_res:nnslookup/4..4</c> are no longer recommended
	    to use, instead use <c>inet_res:lookup/3..5</c> and
	    <c>inet_res:resolve/3..5</c> which provide clearer
	    argument types and the possibility to override options in
	    the call. </p><p> Users of previous unsupported versions
	    of inet_res have included internal header files to get to
	    the internal record definitions in order to examine DNS
	    replies. This is still unsupported and there are access
	    functions in inet_dns to use instead. These are
	    documented in inet_res(3). </p><p> Bug fix: a compression
	    reference loop would make DNS message decoding loop
	    forever. Problem reported by Florian Weimer. </p><p> Bug
	    fix and patch suggestion by Sergei Golovan: configuring
	    IPv6 nameservers did not work. His patch (as he warned)
	    created many UDP sockets; one per nameserver. This has
	    been fixed in the released version. </p><p> Improvement:
	    <c>inet_res</c> is now EDNS0 capable. The current
	    implementation is simple and does not probe and cache
	    EDNS info for nameservers, which a fully capable
	    implementation probably should do. EDNS has to be enabled
	    via resolver configuration, and if a nameserver replies
	    that it does not support EDNS, <c>inet_res</c> falls back
	    to a regular DNS query. </p><p> Improvement: now
	    <c>inet_res</c> automatically falls back to TCP if it
	    gets a truncated answer from a nameserver. </p><p>
	    Warning: some of the ancient and exotic record types
	    handled by <c>inet_res</c> and <c>inet_dns</c> are not
	    supported by current versions of BIND, so they could not
	    be tested after the rewrite, with reasonable effort, e.g
	    MD, MF, NULL, and SPF. The risk for bugs in these
	    particular records is still low since their code is
	    mostly shared with other tested record types. </p>

	    A TCP socket with option <c>{packet,4}</c> could crash
	    the emulator if it received a packet header with a very
	    large size value (>2Gb). The same bug caused
	    <c>erlang:decode_packet/3</c> to return faulty values.

	    The file module has now a read_line/1 function similar to
	    the io:get_line/2, but with byte oriented semantics. The
	    function file:read_line/1 works for raw files as well,
	    but for good performance it is recommended to use it
	    together with the 'read_ahead' option for raw file
	    access.</p>

	    Added functionality to get higher resolution timestamp
	    from system. The erlang:now function returns a timestamp
	    that's not always consistent with the actual operating
	    system time (due to resilience against large time changes
	    in the operating system). The function os:timestamp/0 is
	    added to get a similar timestamp as the one being
	    returned by erlang:now, but untouched by Erlangs time
	    correcting and smoothing algorithms. The timestamp
	    returned by os:timestamp is always consistent with the
	    operating systems view of time, like the calendar
	    functions for getting wall clock time, but with higher
	    resolution. Example of usage can be found in the os
	    manual page.</p>

	    The error behavior of gen_tcp and gen_udp has been
	    corrected. gen_tcp:connect/3,4 and gen_udp:send/4 now
	    returns {error,eafnosupport} for conflicting destination
	    address versus socket address family. Other corner cases
	    for IP address string host names combined with not using
	    the native (OS) resolver (which is not default) has also
	    been changed to return {error,nxdomain} instead of
	    {error,einval}. Those changes just may surprise old
	    existing code. gen_tcp:listen/2 and gen_udp:open/2 now
	    fails for conflicting local address versus socket address
	    family instead of trying to use an erroneous address.
	    Problem reported by Per Hedeland.</p>

	    <p>Processes spawned using <c>proc_lib</c> (including
	    <c>gen_server</c> and other library modules that use
	    <c>proc_lib</c>) no longer keep the entire argument list
	    for the initial call, but only the arity.</p>
	    <p>Also, if <c>proc_lib:spawn/1</c> is used to spawn a
	    fun, the actual fun is not kept, but only module,
	    function name, and arity of the function that implements
	    the fun.</p>
	    <p>The reason for the change is that keeping the initial
	    fun (or a fun in an argument list), would prevent
	    upgrading the code for the module. A secondary reason is
	    that keeping the fun and function arguments could waste a
	    significant amount of memory.</p>
	    <p>The drawback with the change is that the crash reports
	    will provide less precise information about the initial
	    call (only <c>Module:Function/Arity</c> instead of
	    <c>Module:Function(Arguments)</c>). The function
	    <c>proc_lib:initial_call/1</c> still returns a list, but

	    The internal (rarely used) DNS resolver has been modified
	    to not use the domain search list when asked to resolve
	    an absolute name; a name with a terminating dot. There
	    was also a bug causing it to create malformed DNS queries
	    for absolute names that has been corrected, correction
	    suggested by Scott Lystig Fritchie. The code has also
	    been corrected to look up cached RRs in the same search
	    order as non-cached, now allows having the root domain
	    among the search domains, and can now actually do a zone
	    transfer request.</p>

          <p>The shell has been updated to fix the following flaws:
            Shell process exit left you with an unresponsive initial
            shell if not using oldshell. Starting a restricted shell
            with a nonexisting callback module resulted in a shell
            where no commands could be used, not even init:stop/0.
            Fun's could not be used as parameters to local shell
            functions (in shell_default or user_default) when
            restricted_shell was active.</p>

          <p>When setting the kernel configuration parameter
            <c>error_logger</c> to <c>false</c>, the documentation
            stated that "No error logger handler is installed". This
            is true, but error logging is not turned off, as the
            initial, primitive error logger event handler is kept,
            printing raw event messages to tty.</p>
          <p>Changing this behavior can be viewed as a backward
            incompatible change. Instead a new value <c>silent</c>
            for the configuration parameter has been added, which

          <p>An interface towards the SCTP Socket API Extensions
            has been implemented.It is an Open Source patch courtesy
            of Serge Aleynikov and Leonid Timochouk. The Erlang code
            parts has been adapted by the OTP team, changing the
            Erlang API somewhat.</p>
          <p>The Erlang interface consists of the module
            <c>gen_sctp</c> and an include file
            <c>-include_lib("kernel/include/inet_sctp.hrl").</c> for
            option record definitions. The <c>gen_sctp</c> module is
            documented.</p>
          <p>The delivered Open Source patch, before the OTP team
            rewrites, was written according to
            <url href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctpsocket-13">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctpsocket-13</url>
            and was claimed to work fine, tested on Linux Fedora Core
            5.0 (kernel 2.6.15-2054 or later) and on Solaris 10 and
            11. The OTP team rewrites used the same standard document
            but might have accidentally broken some functionality. If
            so, it will soon be patched to working state. The tricky
            parts in C and the general design has essentially not
            changed. During the rewrites the code was hand tested on
            SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 10, and briefly on Solaris
            10. Feedbach on code and docs is very much
            appreciated.</p>
          <p>The SCTP interface is in beta state. It has only been
            hand tested and has no automatic test suites in OTP
            meaning everything is most certainly not tested. Socket
            active mode is broken. IPv6 is not tested. The documentation
            has been reworked due to the API changes,
            but has not been proofread after this.</p>
          <p>Thank you from the OTP team to Serge Aleynikov and
            Leonid Timochouk for a valuable contribution. We hope we
            have not messed it up too much.</p>

          <p>To help Dialyzer find more bugs, many functions in the
            Kernel and STDLIB applications now only accept arguments
            of the type that is documented.</p>
          <p>For instance, the functions <c>lists:prefix/2</c> and
            <c>lists:suffix/2</c> are documented to only accept lists
            as their arguments, but they actually accepted anything
            and returned <c>false</c>. That has been changed so that
            the functions cause an exception if one or both arguments
            are not lists.</p>
          <p>Also, the <c>string:strip/3</c> function is documented
            to take a character argument that is a character to strip
            from one or both ends of the string. Given a list instead
            of a character, it used to do nothing, but will now cause
            an exception.</p>
          <p>Dialyzer will find most cases where those functions
            are passed arguments of the wrong type.</p>

          <p>When repairing a disk log with a corrupt index file
            (caused by for instance a hard disk failure) the old
            contents of the index file is kept unmodified. This will
            make repeated attempts to open the disk log fail every
            time.</p>

          <p>Previously <c>unlink/1</c> and <c>erlang:demonitor/2</c>
            behaved completely asynchronous. This had one undesirable
            effect, though. You could never know when you were
            guaranteed <em>not</em> to be affected by a link that you
            had unlinked or a monitor that you had demonitored.</p>
          <p>The new behavior of <c>unlink/1</c> and
            <c>erlang:demonitor/2</c> can be viewed as two operations
            performed atomically. Asynchronously send an unlink
            signal or a demonitor signal, and ignore any future
            results of the link or monitor.</p>
          <p><em>NOTE</em>: This change can cause some obscure code
            to fail which previously did not. For example, the
            following code might hang:</p>
          <code type="none">
            Mon = erlang:monitor(process, Pid),
            %% ...
            exit(Pid, bang),
            erlang:demonitor(Mon),
            receive
                {'DOWN', Mon, process, Pid, _} -> ok
            %% We were previously guaranteed to get a down message
            %% (since we exited the process ourself), so we could
            %% in this case leave out:
            %% after 0 -> ok
            end,

          <p>The behavior when an application fails to start and
            possibly causes the runtime system to halt has been
            cleaned up, including fixing some minor bugs.</p>
          <p><c>application_controller</c> should now always terminate
            with a non-nested string, meaning the slogan in an
            <c>erl_crash.dump</c> should always be easy to read.</p>
          <p><c>init</c> now makes sure that the slogan passed to
            <c>erlang:halt/1</c> does not exceed the maximum allowed
            length.</p>
          <p>Redundant calls to <c>list_to_atom/1</c> has been removed

          <p>Timers could sometimes timeout too early. This bug has

            socket. (Reported and diagnosed by Alexey Shchepin.)</p>

            the equivalent of <c>register/2</c>, which returns
            <c>badarg</c> if a process is already registered. As it
            turns out there is no check in <c>global</c> if a process is
            registered under more than one name. If some process is
            accidentaly or by design given several names, it is
            possible that the name registry becomes inconsistent due
            to the way the resolve function is called when name
            clashes are discovered (see <c>register_name/3</c> in

            variable, <c>global_multi_name_action</c>, is hereby
            introduced. Depending on its value (<c>info</c>,
            <c>warning</c>, or <c>error</c>), messages are sent to
            the error logger when <c>global</c> discovers that some
            process is given more than one name. The variable only
            affects the node where it is defined.</p>
