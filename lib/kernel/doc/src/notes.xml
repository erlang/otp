	    <p>A mechanism for limiting the amount of text that the
	    built-in error logger events will produce has been
	    introduced. It is useful for limiting both the size of
	    log files and the CPU time used to produce them.</p>
	    <p>This mechanism is experimental in the sense that it
	    may be changed if it turns out that it does not solve the
	    problem it is supposed to solve. In that case, there may
	    be backward incompatible improvements to this
	    mechanism.</p>
	    <p>See the documentation for the config parameter
	    <c>error_logger_format_depth</c> in the Kernel
	    application for information about how to turn on this
	    feature.</p>

	    The internal group to user_drv protocol has been changed
	    to be synchronous in order to guarantee that output sent
	    to a process implementing the user_drv protocol is
	    printed before replying. This protocol is used by the
	    standard_output device and the ssh application when
	    acting as a client. </p>
          <p>
	    This change changes the previous unlimited buffer when
	    printing to standard_io and other devices that end up in
	    user_drv to 1KB.</p>

	    gen_tcp:shutdown/2 is now asynchronous</p>
          <p>
	    This solves the following problems with the old
	    implementation:</p>
          <p>
	    It doesn't block when the TCP peer is idle or slow. This
	    is the expected behaviour when shutdown() is called: the
	    caller needs to be able to continue reading from the
	    socket, not be prevented from doing so.</p>
          <p>
	    It doesn't truncate the output. The current version of
	    gen_tcp:shutdown/2 will truncate any outbound data in the
	    driver queue after about 10 seconds if the TCP peer is
	    idle of slow. Worse yet, it doesn't even inform anyone
	    that the data has been truncated: 'ok' is returned to the
	    caller; and a FIN rather than an RST is sent to the TCP
	    peer.</p>

	    There are many cases where user code needs to be able to
	    distinguish between a socket that was closed normally and
	    one that was aborted. Setting the option
	    {show_econnreset, true} enables the user to receive
	    ECONNRESET errors on both active and passive sockets.</p>

	    The standard_error process now handles the getopts I/O
	    protocol request correctly and stores its encoding in the
	    same way as standard_io.</p>
          <p>
	    Also, io:put_chars(standard_error, [oops]) could
	    previously crash the standard_error process. This is now
	    corrected.</p>

	    If the Config given to

	    file, the new application did not get correct config
	    data.</p>
          <p>
	    This is now changed so config data will be expanded for

	    <p><c>code:add_path("/ending/in/slash/")</c> removes the

	    <c>code:del_path("/ending/in/slash/")</c> would fail to

	    The new option <c>persistent</c> is added to

	    with the <c>persistent</c> option will not be overridden
	    by the ones configured in the application resource file
	    on load. This means persistent values will stick after
	    the application is loaded and also on application reload.

	    The spec for file:set_cwd/1 is modified to also accept
	    binaries as arguments. This has always been allowed in
	    the code, but it was not reflected in the spec since
	    binaries are mostly used for raw file names. Raw file
	    names are names that are not encoded according to
	    file:native_name_encoding(), and these are not allowed in
	    file:set_cwd/1. The spec is now, however, more allowing
	    in order to avoid unnecessary dialyzer warnings. Raw file
	    names will still fail in runtime with reason
	    'no_translation'. (Thanks to Jos√© Valim)</p>

	    Erlang/OTP has been ported to the realtime operating
	    system OSE. The port supports both smp and non-smp
	    emulator. For details around the port and how to started
	    see the User's Guide in the ose application. </p>
          <p>
	    Note that not all parts of Erlang/OTP has been ported. </p>
          <p>
	    Notable things that work are: non-smp and smp emulators,
	    OSE signal interaction, crypto, asn1, run_erl/to_erl,
	    tcp, epmd, distribution and most if not all non-os
	    specific functionality of Erlang.</p>
          <p>
	    Notable things that does not work are: udp/sctp, os_mon,
	    erl_interface, binding of schedulers.</p>

	    Add the {active,N} socket option for TCP, UDP, and SCTP,
	    where N is an integer in the range -32768..32767, to
	    allow a caller to specify the number of data messages to
	    be delivered to the controlling process. Once the
	    socket's delivered message count either reaches 0 or is
	    explicitly set to 0 with inet:setopts/2 or by including
	    {active,0} as an option when the socket is created, the
	    socket transitions to passive ({active, false}) mode and
	    the socket's controlling process receives a message to
	    inform it of the transition. TCP sockets receive
	    {tcp_passive,Socket}, UDP sockets receive
	    {udp_passive,Socket} and SCTP sockets receive
	    {sctp_passive,Socket}. </p>
          <p>
	    The socket's delivered message counter defaults to 0, but
	    it can be set using {active,N} via any gen_tcp, gen_udp,
	    or gen_sctp function that takes socket options as
	    arguments, or via inet:setopts/2. New N values are added
	    to the socket's current counter value, and negative
	    numbers can be used to reduce the counter value.
	    Specifying a number that would cause the socket's counter
	    value to go above 32767 causes an einval error. If a
	    negative number is specified such that the counter value
	    would become negative, the socket's counter value is set
	    to 0 and the socket transitions to passive mode. If the
	    counter value is already 0 and inet:setopts(Socket,
	    [{active,0}]) is specified, the counter value remains at
	    0 but the appropriate passive mode transition message is
	    generated for the socket.</p>

	    A call to either the <c>garbage_collect/1</c> BIF or the
	    <c>check_process_code/2</c> BIF may trigger garbage
	    collection of another processes than the process calling
	    the BIF. The previous implementations performed these
	    kinds of garbage collections without considering the
	    internal state of the process being garbage collected. In
	    order to be able to more easily and more efficiently
	    implement yielding native code, these types of garbage
	    collections have been rewritten. A garbage collection
	    like this is now triggered by an asynchronous request
	    signal, the actual garbage collection is performed by the
	    process being garbage collected itself, and finalized by
	    a reply signal to the process issuing the request. Using
	    this approach processes can disable garbage collection
	    and yield without having to set up the heap in a state
	    that can be garbage collected.</p>
          <p>
	    The <seealso
	    marker="erts:erlang#garbage_collect/2"><c>garbage_collect/2</c></seealso>,
	    and <seealso
	    marker="erts:erlang#check_process_code/3"><c>check_process_code/3</c></seealso>
	    BIFs have been introduced. Both taking an option list as
	    last argument. Using these, one can issue asynchronous
	    requests.</p>
          <p>
	    <c>code:purge/1</c> and <c>code:soft_purge/1</c> have
	    been rewritten to utilize asynchronous
	    <c>check_process_code</c> requests in order to
	    parallelize work.</p>
          <p>
	    Characteristics impact: A call to the
	    <c>garbage_collect/1</c> BIF or the
	    <c>check_process_code/2</c> BIF will normally take longer
	    time to complete while the system as a whole wont be as
	    much negatively effected by the operation as before. A
	    call to <c>code:purge/1</c> and <c>code:soft_purge/1</c>
	    may complete faster or slower depending on the state of
	    the system while the system as a whole wont be as much

	    Add sync option to file:open/2.</p>
          <p>
	    The sync option adds the POSIX O_SYNC flag to the open
	    system call on platforms that support the flag or its
	    equivalent, e.g., FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH on Windows. For
	    platforms that don't support it, file:open/2 returns
	    {error, enotsup} if the sync option is passed in. Thank

	    Also allow mixed address families to bind, since the

	    with bind, while the rest are to be bound using

          <p>
	    'behaviour_info(callbacks)' is a special function that is
	    defined in a module which describes a behaviour and
	    returns a list of its callbacks.</p>
          <p>
	    This function is now automatically generated using the
	    '-callback' specs. An error is returned by lint if user
	    defines both '-callback' attributes and the
	    behaviour_info/1 function. If no type info is needed for
	    a callback use a generic spec for it. Add '-callback'
	    attribute to language syntax</p>
          <p>
	    Behaviours may define specs for their callbacks using the
	    familiar spec syntax, replacing the '-spec' keyword with
	    '-callback'. Simple lint checks are performed to ensure
	    that no callbacks are defined twice and all types
	    referred are declared.</p>
          <p>
	    These attributes can be then used by tools to provide
	    documentation to the behaviour or find discrepancies in
	    the callback definitions in the callback module.</p>

	    Sanitize the specs of the code module</p>
          <p>
	    After the addition of unicode_binary() to the
	    file:filename() type, dialyzer started complaining about
	    erroneous or incomplete specs in some functions of the
	    'code' module. The culprit was hard-coded information in
	    erl_bif_types for functions of this module, which were
	    not updated. Since these functions have proper specs
	    these days and code duplication (pun intended) is never a
	    good idea, their type information was removed from
	    erl_bif_types.</p>
          <p>
	    While doing this, some erroneous comments were fixed in
	    the code module and also made sure that the code now runs
	    without dialyzer warnings even when the
	    -Wunmatched_returns option is used.</p>
          <p>
	    Some cleanups were applied to erl_bif_types too.</p>

	    The Erlang VM now supports Unicode filenames. The feature
	    is turned on by default on systems where Unicode
	    filenames are mandatory (Windows and MacOSX), but can be
	    enabled on other systems with the '+fnu' emulator option.
	    Enabling the Unicode filename feature on systems where it
	    is not default is however considered experimental and not
	    to be used for production. Together with the Unicode file
	    name support, the concept of "raw filenames" is
	    introduced, which means filenames provided without
	    implicit unicode encoding translation. Raw filenames are
	    provided as binaries, not lists. For further information,
	    see stdlib users guide and the chapter about using
	    Unicode in Erlang. Also see the file module manual page.</p>

	    <p> The DNS resolver client inet_res has been rewritten,
	    documented and released. See inet_res(3) and Erts User's
	    Guide: Inet configuration. </p><p> It can formally not be
	    incompatible with respect to earlier versions since there
	    was no earlier official version. However it was used
	    before and some details have changed. </p><p>
	    Configuration now initializes from /etc/resolv.conf and
	    /etc/hosts on all unix platforms regardless of which
	    distribution mode the node is started in. The directory
	    (/etc) these files are supposed to reside in can be
	    changed via an environment variable. These configuration
	    file locations can also be changed in the inet
	    configuration. The files are monitored for change and
	    re-read, which makes a few resolver configuration
	    variables out of application control. The /etc/hosts
	    entries have now their own cache table that is shadowed
	    (with lookup method 'file' is used) by the application
	    configured host entries. This problem (that inet_res
	    configuration only worked for distribution mode long
	    names) was among other reported by Matthew O'Gorman many
	    moons ago. </p><p> The lookup methods are still 'native'
	    only per default. Resolver configuration is done on all
	    Unix platforms just to get a usable configuration for
	    direct calls to inet_res. </p><p> The functions
	    <c>inet_res:nslookup/3..5</c> and
	    <c>inet_res:nnslookup/4..4</c> are no longer recommended
	    to use, instead use <c>inet_res:lookup/3..5</c> and
	    <c>inet_res:resolve/3..5</c> which provide clearer
	    argument types and the possibility to override options in
	    the call. </p><p> Users of previous unsupported versions
	    of inet_res have included internal header files to get to
	    the internal record definitions in order to examine DNS
	    replies. This is still unsupported and there are access
	    functions in inet_dns to use instead. These are
	    documented in inet_res(3). </p><p> Bug fix: a compression
	    reference loop would make DNS message decoding loop
	    forever. Problem reported by Florian Weimer. </p><p> Bug
	    fix and patch suggestion by Sergei Golovan: configuring
	    IPv6 nameservers did not work. His patch (as he warned)
	    created many UDP sockets; one per nameserver. This has
	    been fixed in the released version. </p><p> Improvement:
	    <c>inet_res</c> is now EDNS0 capable. The current
	    implementation is simple and does not probe and cache
	    EDNS info for nameservers, which a fully capable
	    implementation probably should do. EDNS has to be enabled
	    via resolver configuration, and if a nameserver replies
	    that it does not support EDNS, <c>inet_res</c> falls back
	    to a regular DNS query. </p><p> Improvement: now
	    <c>inet_res</c> automatically falls back to TCP if it
	    gets a truncated answer from a nameserver. </p><p>
	    Warning: some of the ancient and exotic record types
	    handled by <c>inet_res</c> and <c>inet_dns</c> are not
	    supported by current versions of BIND, so they could not
	    be tested after the rewrite, with reasonable effort, e.g
	    MD, MF, NULL, and SPF. The risk for bugs in these
	    particular records is still low since their code is
	    mostly shared with other tested record types. </p>

	    access.</p>

	    Added functionality to get higher resolution timestamp
	    from system. The erlang:now function returns a timestamp
	    that's not always consistent with the actual operating
	    system time (due to resilience against large time changes
	    in the operating system). The function os:timestamp/0 is
	    added to get a similar timestamp as the one being
	    returned by erlang:now, but untouched by Erlangs time
	    correcting and smoothing algorithms. The timestamp
	    returned by os:timestamp is always consistent with the
	    operating systems view of time, like the calendar
	    functions for getting wall clock time, but with higher
	    resolution. Example of usage can be found in the os
	    manual page.</p>

	    The error behavior of gen_tcp and gen_udp has been
	    corrected. gen_tcp:connect/3,4 and gen_udp:send/4 now
	    returns {error,eafnosupport} for conflicting destination
	    address versus socket address family. Other corner cases
	    for IP address string host names combined with not using
	    the native (OS) resolver (which is not default) has also
	    been changed to return {error,nxdomain} instead of
	    {error,einval}. Those changes just may surprise old
	    existing code. gen_tcp:listen/2 and gen_udp:open/2 now
	    fails for conflicting local address versus socket address
	    family instead of trying to use an erroneous address.

	    <p>Potential incompatibility: If one has written a custom

          <p>When setting the kernel configuration parameter
            <c>error_logger</c> to <c>false</c>, the documentation
            stated that "No error logger handler is installed". This
            is true, but error logging is not turned off, as the
            initial, primitive error logger event handler is kept,
            printing raw event messages to tty.</p>
          <p>Changing this behavior can be viewed as a backward
            incompatible change. Instead a new value <c>silent</c>
            for the configuration parameter has been added, which
            ensures that error logging is completely turned off.</p>

          <p>An interface towards the SCTP Socket API Extensions
            has been implemented.It is an Open Source patch courtesy
            of Serge Aleynikov and Leonid Timochouk. The Erlang code
            parts has been adapted by the OTP team, changing the
            Erlang API somewhat.</p>
          <p>The Erlang interface consists of the module
            <c>gen_sctp</c> and an include file
            <c>-include_lib("kernel/include/inet_sctp.hrl").</c> for
            option record definitions. The <c>gen_sctp</c> module is
            documented.</p>
          <p>The delivered Open Source patch, before the OTP team
            rewrites, was written according to
            <url href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctpsocket-13">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctpsocket-13</url>
            and was claimed to work fine, tested on Linux Fedora Core
            5.0 (kernel 2.6.15-2054 or later) and on Solaris 10 and
            11. The OTP team rewrites used the same standard document
            but might have accidentally broken some functionality. If
            so, it will soon be patched to working state. The tricky
            parts in C and the general design has essentially not
            changed. During the rewrites the code was hand tested on
            SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 10, and briefly on Solaris
            10. Feedbach on code and docs is very much
            appreciated.</p>
          <p>The SCTP interface is in beta state. It has only been
            hand tested and has no automatic test suites in OTP
            meaning everything is most certainly not tested. Socket
            active mode is broken. IPv6 is not tested. The documentation
            has been reworked due to the API changes,
            but has not been proofread after this.</p>
          <p>Thank you from the OTP team to Serge Aleynikov and
            Leonid Timochouk for a valuable contribution. We hope we
            have not messed it up too much.</p>

          <p>To help Dialyzer find more bugs, many functions in the
            Kernel and STDLIB applications now only accept arguments
            of the type that is documented.</p>
          <p>For instance, the functions <c>lists:prefix/2</c> and
            <c>lists:suffix/2</c> are documented to only accept lists
            as their arguments, but they actually accepted anything
            and returned <c>false</c>. That has been changed so that
            the functions cause an exception if one or both arguments
            are not lists.</p>
          <p>Also, the <c>string:strip/3</c> function is documented
            to take a character argument that is a character to strip
            from one or both ends of the string. Given a list instead
            of a character, it used to do nothing, but will now cause
            an exception.</p>
          <p>Dialyzer will find most cases where those functions
            are passed arguments of the wrong type.</p>

          <p>Previously <c>unlink/1</c> and <c>erlang:demonitor/2</c>
            behaved completely asynchronous. This had one undesirable
            effect, though. You could never know when you were

            had unlinked or a monitor that you had demonitored.</p>
          <p>The new behavior of <c>unlink/1</c> and

            results of the link or monitor.</p>
          <p><em>NOTE</em>: This change can cause some obscure code

          <p>Timers could sometimes timeout too early. This bug has

            meant to replace tuple funs <c>{M,F}</c> which have many
            problems.</p>
          <p>The new type test <c>is_function(Fun,A)</c> (which may be
            used in guards) test whether <c>Fun</c> is a fun that can be
            applied with <c>A</c> arguments. (Currently, <c>Fun</c> can
            also be a tuple fun.)</p>

          <p>According to the documentation <c>global</c> implements
            the equivalent of <c>register/2</c>, which returns
            <c>badarg</c> if a process is already registered. As it
            turns out there is no check in <c>global</c> if a process is
            registered under more than one name. If some process is
            accidentally or by design given several names, it is
            possible that the name registry becomes inconsistent due
            to the way the resolve function is called when name
            clashes are discovered (see <c>register_name/3</c> in
            <c>global(3)</c>).</p>
          <p>In OTP R11B <c>global</c> will not allow the registration of
            a process under more than one name. To help finding code
            where <c>no</c> will be returned, a Kernel application
            variable, <c>global_multi_name_action</c>, is hereby
            introduced. Depending on its value (<c>info</c>,
            <c>warning</c>, or <c>error</c>), messages are sent to
            the error logger when <c>global</c> discovers that some
            process is given more than one name. The variable only
            affects the node where it is defined.</p>

          <p>The <c>c</c> option for the <c>+B</c> flag has been
            introduced which makes it possible to use Ctrl-C
            (Ctrl-Break on Windows) to interrupt the shell process
            rather than to invoke the emulator break handler. All new
            <c>+B</c> options are also supported on Windows (werl) as
            of now. Furthermore, Ctrl-C on Windows has now been
            reserved for copying text (what Ctrl-Ins was used for
            previously). Ctrl-Break should be used for break handling.
            Lastly, the documentation of the system flags has been
            updated.</p>

          <p>The possibility to start the Erlang shell in parallel

            compatibility in STDLIB 1.13.1. The flag to be used for
            this is now called <c>async_shell_start</c> and has
            been documented. New shells started from the JCL menu are
            not synchronized with <c>init</c> anymore. This makes it
            possible to start a new shell (e.g. for debugging purposes)
            even if the initial shell has not come up.</p>
