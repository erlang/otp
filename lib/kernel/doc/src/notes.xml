	    <p>Function <c>inet:ntoa/1</c> has been fixed to return
	    lowercase letters according to RFC 5935 that has been
	    approved after this function was written. Previously
	    uppercase letters were returned so this may be a
	    backwards incompatible change depending on how the
	    returned address string is used.</p>
	    <p>Function <c>inet:parse_address/1</c> has been fixed to
	    accept %-suffixes on scoped addresses. The addresses does
	    not work yet, but gives no parse errors.</p>

	    loaded modules that have changed on disk.
	    <c>code:module_status/1</c> returns the status for a

	    <p> The size of crash reports created by
	    <c>gen_server</c>, <c>gen_statem</c> and <c>proc_lib</c>
	    is limited with aid of the Kernel application variable
	    <c>error_logger_format_depth</c>. The purpose is to limit
	    the size of the messages sent to the <c>error_logger</c>
	    process when processes with huge message queues or states
	    crash. </p> <p>The crash report generated by
	    <c>proc_lib</c> includes the new tag
	    <c>message_queue_len</c>. The neighbour report also
	    includes the new tag <c>current_stacktrace</c>. Finally,
	    the neighbour report no longer includes the tags
	    <c>messages</c> and <c>dictionary</c>. </p> <p> The new
	    function <c>error_logger:get_format_depth/0</c> can be
	    used to retrieve the value of the Kernel application
	    variable <c>error_logger_format_depth</c>. </p>

          <p>
	    It doesn't block when the TCP peer is idle or slow. This

	    socket, not be prevented from doing so.</p>
          <p>
	    It doesn't truncate the output. The current version of
	    gen_tcp:shutdown/2 will truncate any outbound data in the
	    driver queue after about 10 seconds if the TCP peer is
	    idle of slow. Worse yet, it doesn't even inform anyone
	    that the data has been truncated: 'ok' is returned to the
	    caller; and a FIN rather than an RST is sent to the TCP

	    OTP-11850 fixed filelib:wildcard/1 to work with broken

	    filelib:file_size/1, etc. This is now corrected.</p>

	    If the Config given to

	    The spec for file:set_cwd/1 is modified to also accept

	    names are names that are not encoded according to
	    file:native_name_encoding(), and these are not allowed in
	    file:set_cwd/1. The spec is now, however, more allowing
	    in order to avoid unnecessary dialyzer warnings. Raw file
	    names will still fail in runtime with reason
	    'no_translation'. (Thanks to José Valim)</p>

	    Erlang/OTP has been ported to the realtime operating

	    emulator. For details around the port and how to started
	    see the User's Guide in the ose application. </p>
          <p>
	    Note that not all parts of Erlang/OTP has been ported. </p>
          <p>
	    Notable things that work are: non-smp and smp emulators,
	    OSE signal interaction, crypto, asn1, run_erl/to_erl,
	    tcp, epmd, distribution and most if not all non-os
	    specific functionality of Erlang.</p>
          <p>
	    Notable things that does not work are: udp/sctp, os_mon,
	    erl_interface, binding of schedulers.</p>

	    Add the {active,N} socket option for TCP, UDP, and SCTP,
	    where N is an integer in the range -32768..32767, to
	    allow a caller to specify the number of data messages to
	    be delivered to the controlling process. Once the
	    socket's delivered message count either reaches 0 or is
	    explicitly set to 0 with inet:setopts/2 or by including
	    {active,0} as an option when the socket is created, the
	    socket transitions to passive ({active, false}) mode and
	    the socket's controlling process receives a message to
	    inform it of the transition. TCP sockets receive
	    {tcp_passive,Socket}, UDP sockets receive
	    {udp_passive,Socket} and SCTP sockets receive
	    {sctp_passive,Socket}. </p>
          <p>
	    The socket's delivered message counter defaults to 0, but
	    it can be set using {active,N} via any gen_tcp, gen_udp,
	    or gen_sctp function that takes socket options as
	    arguments, or via inet:setopts/2. New N values are added
	    to the socket's current counter value, and negative
	    numbers can be used to reduce the counter value.
	    Specifying a number that would cause the socket's counter
	    value to go above 32767 causes an einval error. If a
	    negative number is specified such that the counter value
	    would become negative, the socket's counter value is set
	    to 0 and the socket transitions to passive mode. If the
	    counter value is already 0 and inet:setopts(Socket,
	    [{active,0}]) is specified, the counter value remains at
	    0 but the appropriate passive mode transition message is
	    generated for the socket.</p>

	    A call to either the <c>garbage_collect/1</c> BIF or the
	    <c>check_process_code/2</c> BIF may trigger garbage
	    collection of another processes than the process calling
	    the BIF. The previous implementations performed these
	    kinds of garbage collections without considering the
	    internal state of the process being garbage collected. In
	    order to be able to more easily and more efficiently
	    implement yielding native code, these types of garbage
	    collections have been rewritten. A garbage collection
	    like this is now triggered by an asynchronous request
	    signal, the actual garbage collection is performed by the
	    process being garbage collected itself, and finalized by
	    a reply signal to the process issuing the request. Using
	    this approach processes can disable garbage collection
	    and yield without having to set up the heap in a state
	    that can be garbage collected.</p>
          <p>
	    The <seealso
	    marker="erts:erlang#garbage_collect/2"><c>garbage_collect/2</c></seealso>,
	    and <seealso
	    marker="erts:erlang#check_process_code/3"><c>check_process_code/3</c></seealso>
	    BIFs have been introduced. Both taking an option list as
	    last argument. Using these, one can issue asynchronous
	    requests.</p>
          <p>
	    <c>code:purge/1</c> and <c>code:soft_purge/1</c> have
	    been rewritten to utilize asynchronous
	    <c>check_process_code</c> requests in order to
	    parallelize work.</p>
          <p>
	    Characteristics impact: A call to the
	    <c>garbage_collect/1</c> BIF or the
	    <c>check_process_code/2</c> BIF will normally take longer
	    time to complete while the system as a whole wont be as
	    much negatively effected by the operation as before. A
	    call to <c>code:purge/1</c> and <c>code:soft_purge/1</c>
	    may complete faster or slower depending on the state of
	    the system while the system as a whole wont be as much
	    negatively effected by the operation as before.</p>

	    Environment variable 'shutdown_timeout' is added to
	    kernel application. Earlier, application_controller would
	    hang forever if an application top supervisor did not
	    terminate upon a shutdown request. If this new
	    environment variable is set to a positive integer T, then
	    application controller will now give up after T
	    milliseconds and instead brutally kill the application.
	    For backwards compatibility, the default value for
	    shutdown_timeout is 'infinity'.</p>

	    Replace the behaviour_info(callbacks) export in stdlib's
	    behaviours with -callback' attributes for all the
	    callbacks. Update the documentation with information on
	    the callback attribute Automatically generate
	    'behaviour_info' function from '-callback' attributes</p>
          <p>
	    'behaviour_info(callbacks)' is a special function that is
	    defined in a module which describes a behaviour and
	    returns a list of its callbacks.</p>
          <p>
	    This function is now automatically generated using the
	    '-callback' specs. An error is returned by lint if user
	    defines both '-callback' attributes and the
	    behaviour_info/1 function. If no type info is needed for
	    a callback use a generic spec for it. Add '-callback'
	    attribute to language syntax</p>
          <p>
	    Behaviours may define specs for their callbacks using the
	    familiar spec syntax, replacing the '-spec' keyword with
	    '-callback'. Simple lint checks are performed to ensure
	    that no callbacks are defined twice and all types
	    referred are declared.</p>
          <p>
	    These attributes can be then used by tools to provide
	    documentation to the behaviour or find discrepancies in
	    the callback definitions in the callback module.</p>
          <p>
	    Add callback specs into 'application' module in kernel
	    Add callback specs to tftp module following internet
	    documentation Add callback specs to inets_service module

	    erl_bif_types.</p>

	    The Erlang VM now supports Unicode filenames. The feature
	    is turned on by default on systems where Unicode
	    filenames are mandatory (Windows and MacOSX), but can be
	    enabled on other systems with the '+fnu' emulator option.
	    Enabling the Unicode filename feature on systems where it
	    is not default is however considered experimental and not
	    to be used for production. Together with the Unicode file
	    name support, the concept of "raw filenames" is
	    introduced, which means filenames provided without
	    implicit unicode encoding translation. Raw filenames are
	    provided as binaries, not lists. For further information,
	    see stdlib users guide and the chapter about using
	    Unicode in Erlang. Also see the file module manual page.</p>

	    <p> The DNS resolver client inet_res has been rewritten,
	    documented and released. See inet_res(3) and Erts User's
	    Guide: Inet configuration. </p><p> It can formally not be
	    incompatible with respect to earlier versions since there
	    was no earlier official version. However it was used
	    before and some details have changed. </p><p>
	    Configuration now initializes from /etc/resolv.conf and
	    /etc/hosts on all unix platforms regardless of which
	    distribution mode the node is started in. The directory
	    (/etc) these files are supposed to reside in can be
	    changed via an environment variable. These configuration
	    file locations can also be changed in the inet
	    configuration. The files are monitored for change and
	    re-read, which makes a few resolver configuration
	    variables out of application control. The /etc/hosts
	    entries have now their own cache table that is shadowed
	    (with lookup method 'file' is used) by the application
	    configured host entries. This problem (that inet_res
	    configuration only worked for distribution mode long
	    names) was among other reported by Matthew O'Gorman many
	    moons ago. </p><p> The lookup methods are still 'native'
	    only per default. Resolver configuration is done on all
	    Unix platforms just to get a usable configuration for
	    direct calls to inet_res. </p><p> The functions
	    <c>inet_res:nslookup/3..5</c> and
	    <c>inet_res:nnslookup/4..4</c> are no longer recommended
	    to use, instead use <c>inet_res:lookup/3..5</c> and
	    <c>inet_res:resolve/3..5</c> which provide clearer
	    argument types and the possibility to override options in
	    the call. </p><p> Users of previous unsupported versions
	    of inet_res have included internal header files to get to
	    the internal record definitions in order to examine DNS
	    replies. This is still unsupported and there are access
	    functions in inet_dns to use instead. These are
	    documented in inet_res(3). </p><p> Bug fix: a compression
	    reference loop would make DNS message decoding loop
	    forever. Problem reported by Florian Weimer. </p><p> Bug
	    fix and patch suggestion by Sergei Golovan: configuring
	    IPv6 nameservers did not work. His patch (as he warned)
	    created many UDP sockets; one per nameserver. This has
	    been fixed in the released version. </p><p> Improvement:
	    <c>inet_res</c> is now EDNS0 capable. The current
	    implementation is simple and does not probe and cache
	    EDNS info for nameservers, which a fully capable
	    implementation probably should do. EDNS has to be enabled
	    via resolver configuration, and if a nameserver replies
	    that it does not support EDNS, <c>inet_res</c> falls back
	    to a regular DNS query. </p><p> Improvement: now
	    <c>inet_res</c> automatically falls back to TCP if it
	    gets a truncated answer from a nameserver. </p><p>
	    Warning: some of the ancient and exotic record types
	    handled by <c>inet_res</c> and <c>inet_dns</c> are not
	    supported by current versions of BIND, so they could not
	    be tested after the rewrite, with reasonable effort, e.g
	    MD, MF, NULL, and SPF. The risk for bugs in these
	    particular records is still low since their code is
	    mostly shared with other tested record types. </p>

	    Added functionality to get higher resolution timestamp
	    from system. The erlang:now function returns a timestamp
	    that's not always consistent with the actual operating
	    system time (due to resilience against large time changes
	    in the operating system). The function os:timestamp/0 is
	    added to get a similar timestamp as the one being
	    returned by erlang:now, but untouched by Erlangs time
	    correcting and smoothing algorithms. The timestamp
	    returned by os:timestamp is always consistent with the
	    operating systems view of time, like the calendar
	    functions for getting wall clock time, but with higher
	    resolution. Example of usage can be found in the os
	    manual page.</p>

	    <p>Processes spawned using <c>proc_lib</c> (including
	    <c>gen_server</c> and other library modules that use
	    <c>proc_lib</c>) no longer keep the entire argument list
	    for the initial call, but only the arity.</p>
	    <p>Also, if <c>proc_lib:spawn/1</c> is used to spawn a
	    fun, the actual fun is not kept, but only module,
	    function name, and arity of the function that implements
	    the fun.</p>
	    <p>The reason for the change is that keeping the initial
	    fun (or a fun in an argument list), would prevent
	    upgrading the code for the module. A secondary reason is
	    that keeping the fun and function arguments could waste a
	    significant amount of memory.</p>
	    <p>The drawback with the change is that the crash reports
	    will provide less precise information about the initial
	    call (only <c>Module:Function/Arity</c> instead of
	    <c>Module:Function(Arguments)</c>). The function
	    <c>proc_lib:initial_call/1</c> still returns a list, but

	    module has been rewritten to produce better error codes.
	    Posix error codes now originate from the OS file system

	    fails, and 'einval' is generated if the file handle in

	    suggested by Scott Lystig Fritchie. The code has also

          <p>An interface towards the SCTP Socket API Extensions
            has been implemented.It is an Open Source patch courtesy
            of Serge Aleynikov and Leonid Timochouk. The Erlang code
            parts has been adapted by the OTP team, changing the
            Erlang API somewhat.</p>
          <p>The Erlang interface consists of the module
            <c>gen_sctp</c> and an include file
            <c>-include_lib("kernel/include/inet_sctp.hrl").</c> for
            option record definitions. The <c>gen_sctp</c> module is
            documented.</p>
          <p>The delivered Open Source patch, before the OTP team
            rewrites, was written according to
            <url href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctpsocket-13">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctpsocket-13</url>
            and was claimed to work fine, tested on Linux Fedora Core
            5.0 (kernel 2.6.15-2054 or later) and on Solaris 10 and
            11. The OTP team rewrites used the same standard document
            but might have accidentally broken some functionality. If
            so, it will soon be patched to working state. The tricky
            parts in C and the general design has essentially not
            changed. During the rewrites the code was hand tested on
            SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 10, and briefly on Solaris
            10. Feedbach on code and docs is very much
            appreciated.</p>
          <p>The SCTP interface is in beta state. It has only been
            hand tested and has no automatic test suites in OTP
            meaning everything is most certainly not tested. Socket
            active mode is broken. IPv6 is not tested. The documentation
            has been reworked due to the API changes,
            but has not been proofread after this.</p>
          <p>Thank you from the OTP team to Serge Aleynikov and
            Leonid Timochouk for a valuable contribution. We hope we
            have not messed it up too much.</p>

          <p>To help Dialyzer find more bugs, many functions in the
            Kernel and STDLIB applications now only accept arguments
            of the type that is documented.</p>
          <p>For instance, the functions <c>lists:prefix/2</c> and
            <c>lists:suffix/2</c> are documented to only accept lists
            as their arguments, but they actually accepted anything
            and returned <c>false</c>. That has been changed so that
            the functions cause an exception if one or both arguments
            are not lists.</p>
          <p>Also, the <c>string:strip/3</c> function is documented
            to take a character argument that is a character to strip
            from one or both ends of the string. Given a list instead
            of a character, it used to do nothing, but will now cause
            an exception.</p>
          <p>Dialyzer will find most cases where those functions
            are passed arguments of the wrong type.</p>

          <p>Previously <c>unlink/1</c> and <c>erlang:demonitor/2</c>
            behaved completely asynchronous. This had one undesirable
            effect, though. You could never know when you were
            guaranteed <em>not</em> to be affected by a link that you
            had unlinked or a monitor that you had demonitored.</p>
          <p>The new behavior of <c>unlink/1</c> and
            <c>erlang:demonitor/2</c> can be viewed as two operations
            performed atomically. Asynchronously send an unlink
            signal or a demonitor signal, and ignore any future
            results of the link or monitor.</p>
          <p><em>NOTE</em>: This change can cause some obscure code
            to fail which previously did not. For example, the
            following code might hang:</p>

          <p>Timers could sometimes timeout too early. This bug has
            now been fixed.</p>
          <p>Automatic cancellation of timers created by
            <c>erlang:send_after(Time,</c> pid(), Msg), and
            <c>erlang:start_timer(Time,</c> pid(), Msg) has been
            introduced.
            Timers created with the receiver specified by a pid, will
            automatically be cancelled when the receiver exits. For
            more information see the <c>erlang(3)</c> man page.</p>
          <p>In order to be able to maintain a larger amount of timers
            without increasing the maintenance cost, the internal
            timer wheel and bif timer table have been enlarged.</p>
          <p>Also a number of minor bif timer optimizations have been
            implemented.</p>

            <c>badarg</c> if a process is already registered. As it
            turns out there is no check in <c>global</c> if a process is
            registered under more than one name. If some process is
            accidentally or by design given several names, it is
            possible that the name registry becomes inconsistent due
            to the way the resolve function is called when name
            clashes are discovered (see <c>register_name/3</c> in

            variable, <c>global_multi_name_action</c>, is hereby
            introduced. Depending on its value (<c>info</c>,
            <c>warning</c>, or <c>error</c>), messages are sent to
            the error logger when <c>global</c> discovers that some
            process is given more than one name. The variable only
            affects the node where it is defined.</p>

          <p>A BIF <c>erlang:raise/3</c> has been added. See the manual
            for details. It is intended for internal system programming
            only, advanced error handling.</p>

          <p>The Pman 'trace shell' functionality was broken and has
            now been fixed. Furthermore, Pman could not correctly
            find the pid of the active shell if more than one shell
            process was running on the node. This has also been
            corrected.</p>

          <p>You can now start Erlang with the <c>-rsh</c> flag which
            gives you a remote initial shell instead of a local one.
            Example:</p>
          <pre>
            erl -sname this_node -rsh other_node@other_host
          </pre>

          <p>If <c>/etc/hosts</c> specified two hosts with the same IP
            address (on separate lines), only the last host would be
            registered by inet_db during inet configuration. This has
            been corrected now so that both aliases are registered
            with the same IP address.</p>

          <p>The documentation for BIFs that take I/O lists have
            been clarified. Those are <c>list_to_binary/1</c>,
            <c>port_command/2</c>, <c>port_control/3</c>.</p>
          <p>Documentation for all <c>is_*</c> BIFs (such as
            <c>is_atom/1</c>) has been added.</p>
          <p>Removed the documentation for
            <c>erlang:float_to_binary/2</c> which was removed from
            the run-time system several releases ago.</p>
