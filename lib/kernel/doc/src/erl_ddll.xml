  <modulesummary>Dynamic Driver Loader and Linker</modulesummary>
  <description>
    <p>The <c>erl_ddll</c> module provides an interface for loading
      and unloading <em>erlang linked in drivers</em> in runtime.</p>
    <note>
      <p>This is a large reference document. For casual use of the
        module, as well as for most real world applications, the
        descriptions of the functions <seealso marker="#load/2">load/2</seealso> and <seealso marker="#unload/1">unload/1</seealso> are enough to get
        going. </p>
    </note>
    <p>The driver should be provided as a dynamically linked library
      in a object code format specific for the platform in use,
      i. e. <c>.so</c> files on most Unix systems and <c>.ddl</c>
      files on windows. An erlang linked in driver has to provide
      specific interfaces to the emulator, so this module is not
      designed for loading arbitrary dynamic libraries. For further
      information about erlang drivers, refer to the ERTS reference
      manual section <seealso marker="erts:erl_driver">erl_driver</seealso>.</p>
    <marker id="users"></marker>
    <p>When describing a set of functions, (i.e. a module, a part of a
      module or an application) executing in a process and wanting to
      use a ddll-driver, we use the term <em>user</em>. There can be
      several users in one process (different modules needing the same
      driver) and several processes running the same code, making up
      several <em>users</em> of a driver. In the basic scenario, each
      user loads the driver before starting to use it and unloads the
      driver when done. The reference counting keeps track of
      processes as well as the number of loads by each process, so that
      the driver will only be unloaded when no one wants it
      (it has no user). The driver also keeps track of ports that are
      opened towards it, so that one can delay unloading until all
      ports are closed or kill all ports using the driver when it is
      unloaded.  </p>
    <marker id="scenarios"></marker>
    <p>The interface supports two basic scenarios of loading and
      unloading. Each scenario can also have the option of either
      killing ports when the driver is unloading, or waiting for the
      ports to close themselves. The scenarios are:</p>
    <taglist>
      <tag><em>Load and unload on a "when needed basis"</em></tag>
      <item>
        <p>This (most common) scenario simply supports that each
          <seealso marker="#users">user</seealso> of the driver loads
          it when it is needed and unloads it when the <seealso marker="#users">user</seealso> no longer have any use for
          it. The driver is always reference counted and as long as a
          process keeping the driver loaded is still alive, the driver
          is present in the system.</p>
        <p>Each <seealso marker="#users">user</seealso> of the driver
          use <em>literally</em> the same pathname for the driver when
          demanding load, but the <seealso marker="#users">users</seealso> are not really concerned
          with if the driver is already loaded from the filesystem or
          if the object code has to be loaded from filesystem.</p>
        <p>Two pairs of functions support this scenario:</p>
        <taglist>
          <tag><em>load/2 and unload/1</em></tag>
          <item>
            <p>When using the <c>load/unload</c> interfaces, the
              driver will not <em>actually</em> get unloaded until the
              <em>last port</em> using the driver is closed. The function
              <c>unload/1</c> can return immediately, as the <seealso marker="#users">users</seealso> are not really concerned
              with when the actual unloading occurs. The
              driver will actually get unloaded when no one needs it any longer.</p>
            <p>If a process having the driver loaded dies, it will have
              the same effect as if unloading was done. </p>
            <p>When loading, the function <c>load/2</c> returns
              <c>ok</c> as soon as there is any instance of the driver
              present, so that if a driver is waiting to get unloaded
              (due to open ports), it will simply change state to no
              longer need unloading.</p>
          </item>
          <tag><em>load_driver/2 and unload_driver/1</em></tag>
          <item>
            <p>These interfaces is intended to be used when it is considered an
              error that ports are open towards a driver that no <seealso marker="#users">user</seealso>
              has loaded. The ports still open when the
              last <seealso marker="#users">user</seealso> calls
              <c>unload_driver/1</c> or when the last process having the
              driver loaded dies, will get killed with reason
              <c>driver_unloaded</c>.</p>
            <p>The function names <c>load_driver</c> and
              <c>unload_driver</c> are kept for backward
              compatibility.</p>
          </item>
        </taglist>
      </item>
      <tag><em>Loading and reloading for code replacement</em></tag>
      <item>
        <p>This scenario occurs when the driver code might need
          replacement during operation of the Erlang
          emulator. Implementing driver code replacement is somewhat
          more tedious than beam code replacement, as one driver
          cannot be loaded as both "old" and "new" code. All <seealso marker="#users">users</seealso> of a driver must have it
          closed (no open ports) before the old code can be unloaded
          and the new code can be loaded.</p>
        <p>The actual unloading/loading is done as one atomic
          operation, blocking all processes in the system from using
          the driver concerned while in progress.</p>
        <p>The preferred way to do driver code replacement is to let
          <em>one single process</em> keep track of the driver. When
          the process start, the driver is loaded. When replacement
          is required, the driver is reloaded. Unload is probably never
          done, or done when the process exits. If more than one <seealso marker="#users">user</seealso> has a driver loaded when code
          replacement is demanded, the replacement cannot occur until
          the last "other" <seealso marker="#users">user</seealso> has
          unloaded the driver.</p>
        <p>Demanding reload when a reload is already in progress is
          always an error. Using the high level functions, it is also
          an error to demand reloading when more than one <seealso marker="#users">user</seealso> has the driver loaded. To
          simplify driver replacement, avoid designing your system so
          that more than than one <seealso marker="#users">user</seealso> has the driver loaded.</p>
        <p>The two functions for reloading drivers should be used
          together with corresponding load functions, to support the two
          different behaviors concerning open ports:</p>
        <taglist>
          <tag><em>load/2 and reload/2</em></tag>
          <item>
            <p>This pair of functions is used when reloading should be
              done after the last open port towards the driver is
              closed.</p>
            <p>As <c>reload/2</c> actually waits for the reloading to
              occur, a misbehaving process keeping open ports towards
              the driver (or keeping the driver loaded) might cause
              infinite waiting for reload. Timeouts has to be provided
              outside of the process demanding the reload or by using
              the low-level interface <seealso marker="#try_load/3">try_load/3</seealso> in combination
              with driver monitors (see below).</p>
          </item>
          <tag><em>load_driver/2 and reload_driver/2</em></tag>
          <item>
            <p>This pair of functions are used when open ports towards
              the driver should be killed with reason
              <c>driver_unloaded</c> to allow for new driver code to
              get loaded.</p>
            <p>If, however, another process has the driver loaded,
              calling <c>reload_driver</c> returns the error code
              <c>pending_process</c>. As stated earlier,
              the recommended design is to not allow other <seealso marker="#users">users</seealso> than the "driver
              reloader" to actually demand loading of the concerned
              driver.</p>

      <fsummary>Load a driver</fsummary>
      <desc>
        <p>Loads and links the dynamic driver <c><anno>Name</anno></c>. <c><anno>Path</anno></c>
          is a file path to the directory containing the driver.
          <c><anno>Name</anno></c> must be a sharable object/dynamic library. Two
          drivers with different <c><anno>Path</anno></c> parameters cannot be
          loaded under the same name. The <c><anno>Name</anno></c> is a string or
          atom containing at least one character.</p>
        <p>The <c><anno>Name</anno></c> given should correspond to the filename
          of the actual dynamically loadable object file residing in
          the directory given as <c><anno>Path</anno></c>, but <em>without</em> the
          extension (i.e. <c>.so</c>). The driver name provided in
          the driver initialization routine must correspond with the
          filename, in much the same way as erlang module names
          correspond to the names of the <c>.beam</c> files.</p>
        <p>If the driver has been previously unloaded, but is still
          present due to open ports against it, a call to
          <c>load/2</c> will stop the unloading and keep the driver
          (as long as the <c><anno>Path</anno></c> is the same) and <c>ok</c> is
          returned. If one actually wants the object code to be
          reloaded, one uses <seealso marker="#reload/2">reload/2</seealso> or the low-level
          interface <seealso marker="#try_load/3">try_load/3</seealso>
          instead. Please refer to the description of <seealso marker="#scenarios">different scenarios</seealso> for
          loading/unloading in the introduction.</p>
        <p>If more than one process tries to load an already loaded
          driver withe the same <c><anno>Path</anno></c>, or if the same process
          tries to load it several times, the function will return
          <c>ok</c>.  The emulator will keep track of the
          <c>load/2</c> calls, so that a corresponding number of
          <c>unload/2</c> calls will have to be done from the same
          process before the driver will actually get unloaded. It is
          therefore safe for an application to load a driver that is
          shared between processes or applications when needed. It can
          safely be unloaded without causing trouble for other
          parts of the system. </p>
        <p>It is not allowed to load
          several drivers with the same name but with different
          <c>Path</c> parameters.</p>
        <note>
          <p>Note especially that the <c><anno>Path</anno></c> is interpreted
            literally, so that all loaders of the same driver needs to
            give the same <em>literal</em><c><anno>Path</anno></c> string, even
            though different paths might point out the same directory
            in the filesystem (due to use of relative paths and
            links).</p>
        </note>
        <p>On success, the function returns <c>ok</c>. On
          failure, the return value is <c>{error,<anno>ErrorDesc</anno>}</c>,
          where <c><anno>ErrorDesc</anno></c> is an opaque term to be
          translated into human readable form by the <seealso marker="#format_error/1">format_error/1</seealso>
          function.</p>
        <p>For more control over the error handling, again use the

          interface instead.</p>

          process. The <c><anno>MonitorRef</anno></c> returned by this function is
          included in the message sent.</p>
        <p>As with process monitors, each driver monitor set will only
          generate <em>one single message</em>. The monitor is
          "destroyed" after the message is sent and there is then no
          need to call <seealso marker="#demonitor/1">demonitor/1</seealso>.</p>
        <p>The <c><anno>MonitorRef</anno></c> can also be used in subsequent calls
          to <seealso marker="#demonitor/1">demonitor/1</seealso> to
          remove a monitor.</p>
        <p>The function accepts the following parameters:</p>
        <taglist>
          <tag><em><anno>Tag</anno></em></tag>
          <item>
            <p>The monitor tag is always <c>driver</c> as this function
              can only be used to create driver monitors. In the future,
              driver monitors will be integrated with process monitors,
              why this parameter has to be given for consistence.</p>
          </item>
          <tag><em><anno>Item</anno></em></tag>
          <item>
            <p>The <c><anno>Item</anno></c> parameter specifies which driver one
              wants to monitor (the name of the driver) as well as
              which state change one wants to monitor. The parameter
              is a tuple of arity two whose first element is the
              driver name and second element is either of:</p>
            <taglist>
              <tag><em>loaded</em></tag>
              <item>
                <p>Notify me when the driver is reloaded (or loaded if
                  loading is underway). It only makes sense to monitor
                  drivers that are in the process of being loaded or
                  reloaded. One cannot monitor a future-to-be driver
                  name for loading, that will only result in a
                  <c>'DOWN'</c> message being immediately sent.
                  Monitoring for loading is therefore most useful when
                  triggered by the <seealso marker="#try_load/3">try_load/3</seealso> function,
                  where the monitor is created <em>because</em> the
                  driver is in such a pending state.</p>
                <p>Setting a driver monitor for <c>loading</c> will
                  eventually lead to one of the following messages

          <item>
            <p>The filesystem path to the directory where the driver
              object file is situated. The filename of the object file
              (minus extension) must correspond to the driver name
              (used in the name parameter) and the driver must
              identify itself with the very same name. The

              meaning it can be a list of other <c>iolist()</c>s, characters
              (eight bit integers) or binaries, all to be flattened
              into a sequence of characters.</p>
            <p>The (possibly flattened) <c><anno>Path</anno></c> parameter must be
              consistent throughout the system, a driver should, by

              which case the <c><anno>Path</anno></c> may be specified
              differently. Note that all <seealso marker="#users">users</seealso> trying to load the
              driver at a later time will need to use the <em>new</em><c><anno>Path</anno></c> if the <c><anno>Path</anno></c> is changed using a
              <c>reload</c> option. This is yet another reason

              meanings:</p>

              <tag><em>{driver_options, <anno>DriverOptionList</anno>}</em></tag>
              <item>
                <p>This option is to provide options that will change
                  its general behavior and will "stick" to the driver
                  throughout its lifespan.</p>
                <p>The driver options for a given driver name need
                  always to be consistent, <em>even when the driver is reloaded</em>, meaning that they are as much a part
                  of the driver as the actual name.</p>
                <p>Currently the only allowed driver option is
                  <c>kill_ports</c>, which means that all ports opened
                  towards the driver are killed with the exit-reason
                  <c>driver_unloaded</c> when no process any longer
                  has the driver loaded. This situation arises either
                  when the last <seealso marker="#users">user</seealso> calls <seealso marker="#try_unload/2">try_unload/2</seealso>, or
                  the last process having loaded the driver exits.</p>

                <p>A <c><anno>MonitorOption</anno></c> tells <c>try_load/3</c> to
                  trigger a driver monitor under certain
                  conditions. When the monitor is triggered, the
                  function will return a three-tuple <c>{ok, <anno>PendingStatus</anno>, reference()}</c>, where the <c>reference()</c> is
                  the monitor ref for the driver monitor.</p>
                <p>Only one <c><anno>MonitorOption</anno></c> can be specified and
                  it is either the atom <c>pending</c>, which means
                  that a monitor should be created whenever a load
                  operation is delayed, and the atom
                  <c>pending_driver</c>, in which a monitor is
                  created whenever the operation is delayed due to
                  open ports towards an otherwise unused driver. The
                  <c>pending_driver</c> option is of little use, but
                  is present for completeness, it is very well defined
                  which reload-options might give rise to which
                  delays. It might, however, be a good idea to use the
                  same <c><anno>MonitorOption</anno></c> as the <c><anno>ReloadOption</anno></c>
                  if present.</p>
                <p>If reloading is not requested, it might still be
                  useful to specify the <c>monitor</c> option, as
                  forced unloads (<c>kill_ports</c> driver option or
                  the <c>kill_ports</c> option to <seealso marker="#try_unload/2">try_unload/2</seealso>) will
                  trigger a transient state where driver loading
                  cannot be performed until all closing ports are
                  actually closed. So, as <c>try_unload</c> can, in
                  almost all situations, return <c>{ok, pending_driver}</c>, one should always specify at least
                  <c>{monitor, pending_driver}</c> in production
                  code (see the monitor discussion above). </p>

              <item>
                <p>This option is used when one wants to
                  <em>reload</em> a driver from disk, most often in a
                  code upgrade scenario. Having a <c>reload</c> option
                  also implies that the <c><anno>Path</anno></c> parameter need
                  <em>not</em> be consistent with earlier loads of
                  the driver.</p>
                <p>To reload a driver, the process needs to have previously
                  loaded the driver, i.e there has to be an active <seealso marker="#users">user</seealso> of the driver in the process. </p>
                <p>The <c>reload</c> option can be either the atom
                  <c>pending</c>, in which reloading is requested for
                  any driver and will be effectuated when <em>all</em>
                  ports opened against the driver are closed.  The
                  replacement of the driver will in this case take
                  place regardless of if there are still
                  pending <seealso marker="#users">users</seealso>
                  having the driver loaded!
                  The option also triggers port-killing (if the
                  <c>kill_ports</c> driver option is used) even though
                  there are pending users, making it usable for forced
                  driver replacement, but laying a lot of
                  responsibility on the driver <seealso marker="#users">users</seealso>. The pending option is
                  seldom used as one does not want other <seealso marker="#users">users</seealso> to have loaded the
                  driver when code change is underway. </p>
                <p>The more useful option is <c>pending_driver</c>,
                  which means that reloading will be queued if the
                  driver is <em>not</em> loaded by any other <seealso marker="#users">users</seealso>, but the driver has
                  opened ports, in which case <c>{ok, pending_driver}</c> will be returned (a
                  <c>monitor</c> option is of course recommended).</p>
                <p>If the driver is unloaded (not present in the
                  system), the error code
                  <c>not_loaded</c> will be returned. The
                  <c>reload</c> option is intended for when the user
                  has already loaded the driver in advance.</p>

      <name name="try_unload" arity="2"/>
      <fsummary>Unload a driver</fsummary>
      <desc>
        <p>This is the low level function to unload (or decrement
          reference counts of) a driver. It can be used to force port
          killing, in much the same way as the driver option
          <c>kill_ports</c> implicitly does, and it can trigger a
          monitor either due to other <seealso marker="#users">users</seealso> still having the driver
          loaded or that there are open ports using the driver.</p>
        <p>Unloading can be described as the process of telling the
          emulator that this particular part of the code in this
          particular process (i.e. this <seealso marker="#users">user</seealso>) no longer needs the
          driver. That can, if there are no other users, trigger
          actual unloading of the driver, in which case the driver
          name disappears from the system and (if possible) the memory
          occupied by the driver executable code is reclaimed. If the
          driver has the <c>kill_ports</c> option set, or if
          <c>kill_ports</c> was specified as an option to this
          function, all pending ports using this driver will get
          killed when unloading is done by the last <seealso marker="#users">user</seealso>. If no port-killing is
          involved and there are open ports, the actual unloading
          is delayed until there are no more open ports using the
          driver. If, in this case, another <seealso marker="#users">user</seealso> (or even this user) loads the
          driver again before the driver is actually unloaded, the
          unloading will never take place.</p>
        <p>To allow the <seealso marker="#users">user</seealso> that
          <em>requests unloading</em> to wait for <em>actual unloading</em> to
          take place, <c>monitor</c> triggers can be specified in much
          the same way as when loading. As <seealso marker="#users">users</seealso> of this function however
          seldom are interested in more than decrementing the
          reference counts, monitoring is more seldom needed. If the
          <c>kill_ports</c> option is used however, monitor trigging is
          crucial, as the ports are not guaranteed to have been killed
          until the driver is unloaded, why a monitor should be
          triggered for at least the <c>pending_driver</c> case.</p>
        <p>The possible monitor messages that can be expected are the
          same as when using the <c>unloaded</c> option to the
          <seealso marker="#monitor/2">monitor/2</seealso> function.</p>
        <p>The function will return one of the following statuses upon
          success:</p>
        <taglist>
          <tag><em>{ok, unloaded}</em></tag>
          <item>
            <p>The driver was immediately unloaded, meaning that the
              driver name is now free to use by other drivers and, if
              the underlying OS permits it, the memory occupied by the
              driver object code is now reclaimed.</p>
            <p>The driver can only be unloaded when there are no open
              ports using it and there are no more <seealso marker="#users">users</seealso> requiring it to be
              loaded.</p>
          </item>
          <tag><em>{ok, pending_driver}</em>or <em>{ok, pending_driver, reference()}</em></tag>
          <item>
            <p>This return value indicates that this call removed the
              last <seealso marker="#users">user</seealso> from the
              driver, but there are still open ports using it.
              When all ports are closed and no new <seealso marker="#users">users</seealso> have arrived, the driver
              will actually be reloaded and the name and memory
              reclaimed.</p>
            <p>This return value is valid even when the option
              <c>kill_ports</c> was used, as killing ports may not be
              a process that completes immediately. The condition is,
              in that case, however transient. Monitors are as always
              useful to detect when the driver is really unloaded.</p>
