      the Erlang runtime system: file servers, code servers,
      and so on.</p>

      mandatory in the sense that the minimal system based on
      Erlang/OTP consists of Kernel and STDLIB. Kernel
      contains the following functional areas:</p>
    <list type="bulleted">

      <item>Supervision of Erlang/OTP</item>

    </list>
