  <modulesummary>File Interface Module</modulesummary>
  <description>
    <p>The module <c>file</c> provides an interface to the file system.</p>
    <p>On operating systems with thread support, it is possible to let
      file operations be performed in threads of their own, allowing
      other Erlang processes to continue executing in parallel with
      the file operations. See the command line flag
      <c>+A</c> in <seealso marker="erts:erl">erl(1)</seealso>.</p>

    <p>With regard to file name encoding, the Erlang VM can operate in
    two modes. The current mode can be queried using the <seealso
    marker="#native_name_encoding">native_name_encoding/0</seealso>
    function.  It returns either <c>latin1</c> or <c>utf8</c>.</p>

    <p>In the <c>latin1</c> mode, the Erlang VM does not change the
    encoding of file names. In the <c>utf8</c> mode, file names can
    contain Unicode characters greater than 255 and the VM will
    convert file names back and forth to the native file name encoding
    (usually UTF-8, but UTF-16 on Windows).</p>

    <p>The default mode depends on the operating system. Windows and
    MacOS X enforce consistent file name encoding and therefore the
    VM uses the <c>utf8</c> mode.</p>

    <p>On operating systems with transparent naming (i.e. all Unix
    systems except MacOS X), the default will be <c>utf8</c> if the
    terminal supports UTF-8, otherwise <c>latin1</c>. The default may
    be overridden using the <c>+fnl</c> (to force <c>latin1</c> mode)
    or <c>+fnu</c> (to force <c>utf8</c> mode) when starting <seealso
    marker="erts:erl">erl</seealso>.</p>

    <p>On operating systems with transparent naming, files could be
    inconsistently named, i.e. some files are encoded in UTF-8 while
    others are encoded in (for example) iso-latin1. To be able to
    handle file systems with inconsistent naming when running in the
    <c>utf8</c> mode, the concept of "raw file names" has been
    introduced.</p>

    <p>A raw file name is a file name given as a binary. The Erlang VM
    will perform no translation of a file name given as a binary on
    systems with transparent naming.</p>

    <p>When running in the <c>utf8</c> mode, the
    <c>file:list_dir/1</c> and <c>file:read_link/1</c> functions will
    never return raw file names. Use the <seealso
    marker="#list_dir_all">list_dir_all/1</seealso> and <seealso
    marker="#read_link_all">read_link_all/1</seealso> functions to
    return all file names including raw file names.</p>

              The <c>raw</c> option allows faster access to a file,

              However, a file opened in this way has the following
              limitations:</p>
            <list type="bulleted">
              <item>The functions in the <c>io</c> module cannot be used,

               Instead, use the <c>read/2</c>, <c>read_line/1</c> and 
	       <c>write/2</c>
               functions.</item>
	      <item>Especially if <c>read_line/1</c> is to be used on a <c>raw</c> file, it is recommended to combine this option with the <c>{read_ahead, Size}</c> option as line oriented I/O is inefficient without buffering.</item>
              <item>Only the Erlang process which opened the file can use
               it.</item>
              <item>A remote Erlang file server cannot be used;
               the computer on which the Erlang node is running must
               have access to the file system (directly or through
               NFS).</item>

          <item>

          <tag><c>{delayed_write, Size, Delay}</c></tag>
          <item>
            <p>If this option is used, the data in subsequent
              <c>write/2</c> calls is buffered until there are at least
              <c>Size</c> bytes buffered, or until the oldest buffered
              data is <c>Delay</c> milliseconds old. Then all buffered
              data is written in one operating system call.
              The buffered data is also flushed before some other file
              operation than <c>write/2</c> is executed.</p>
            <p>The purpose of this option is to increase performance
              by reducing the number of operating system calls, so the
              <c>write/2</c> calls should be for sizes significantly
              less than <c>Size</c>, and not interspersed by to many
              other file operations, for this to happen.</p>
            <p>When this option is used, the result of <c>write/2</c>
              calls may prematurely be reported as successful, and if
              a write error should actually occur the error is
              reported as the result of the next file operation, which
              is not executed.</p>
            <p>For example, when <c>delayed_write</c> is used, after a
              number of <c>write/2</c> calls, <c>close/1</c> might
              return <c>{error, enospc}</c> because there was not enough
              space on the disc for previously written data, and
              <c>close/1</c> should probably be called again since the
              file is still open.</p>

          <tag><c>{read_ahead, Size}</c></tag>
          <item>
            <p>This option activates read data buffering. If
              <c>read/2</c> calls are for significantly less than
              <c>Size</c> bytes, read operations towards the operating
              system are still performed for blocks of <c>Size</c>
              bytes. The extra data is buffered and returned in
              subsequent <c>read/2</c> calls, giving a performance gain
              since the number of operating system calls is reduced.</p>
	    <p>The <c>read_ahead</c> buffer is also highly utilized
	      by the <c>read_line/1</c> function in <c>raw</c> mode,
	      why this option is recommended (for performance reasons)
	      when accessing raw files using that function.</p>
            <p>If <c>read/2</c> calls are for sizes not significantly
              less than, or even greater than <c>Size</c> bytes, no
              performance gain can be expected.</p>

	      Note that the file size obtained with
              <c>read_file_info/1</c> will most probably not match the
              number of bytes that can be read from a compressed file.</p>

          <tag><c>{encoding, Encoding}</c></tag>
          <item>
            <p>Makes the file perform automatic translation of characters to and from a specific (Unicode) encoding. Note that the data supplied to file:write or returned by file:read still is byte oriented, this option only denotes how data is actually stored in the disk file.</p>
	    <p>Depending on the encoding, different methods of reading and writing data is preferred. The default encoding of <c>latin1</c> implies using this (the file) module for reading and writing data, as the interfaces provided here work with byte-oriented data, while using other (Unicode) encodings makes the  <seealso marker="stdlib:io">io(3)</seealso> module's <c>get_chars</c>, <c>get_line</c> and <c>put_chars</c> functions more suitable, as they can work with the full Unicode range.</p>
	    <p>If data is sent to an <c>io_device()</c> in a format that cannot be converted to the specified encoding, or if data is read by a function that returns data in a format that cannot cope with the character range of the data, an error occurs and the file will be closed.</p> 
	    <p>The allowed values for <c>Encoding</c> are:</p>
	    <taglist>
	    <tag><c>latin1</c></tag>
	    <item>
	    <p>The default encoding. Bytes supplied to i.e. file:write are written as is on the file, likewise bytes read from the file are returned to i.e. file:read as is.

            <p>On platforms that support it, enables the POSIX <c>O_SYNC</c> synchronous I/O flag or its platform-dependent
            equivalent (e.g., <c>FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH</c> on Windows) so that writes to the file block until the data has
            been physically written to disk. Be aware, though, that the exact semantics of this flag differ from platform to
            platform; for example, neither Linux nor Windows guarantees that all file metadata are also written before the call
            returns. For precise semantics, check the details of your platform's documentation. On platforms with no
            support for POSIX <c>O_SYNC</c> or equivalent, use of the <c>sync</c> flag causes <c>open</c> to return
            <c>{error, enotsup}</c>.</p>

          be closed and the process itself will be terminated.

	  <p>For files where <c>encoding</c> is set to something else than <c>latin1</c>, one character might be represented by more than one byte on the file.

	  <p>Also if <c>encoding</c> is set to something else than <c>latin1</c>, the <c>read/3</c> call will fail if the data contains characters larger than 255, why the <seealso marker="stdlib:io">io(3)</seealso> module is to be preferred when reading such a file.</p>

      <desc>
        <p>Makes sure that any buffers kept by the operating system
          (not by the Erlang runtime system) are written to disk. In
          many ways it resembles fsync but it does not update
          some of the file's metadata such as the access time. On
          some platforms this function has no effect.</p>
        <p>Applications that access databases or log files often write
          a tiny data fragment (e.g., one line in a log file) and then
          call fsync() immediately in order to ensure that the written
          data is physically stored on the harddisk. Unfortunately, fsync()
          will always initiate two write operations: one for the newly
          written data and another one in order to update the modification
          time stored in the inode. If the modification time is not a part
          of the transaction concept, fdatasync() can be used to avoid
          unnecessary inode disk write operations.</p>
        <p>Available only in some POSIX systems, this call results in a

    <title>Performance</title>
    <p>Some operating system file operations, for example a
      <c>sync/1</c> or <c>close/1</c> on a huge file, may block their 
      calling thread for seconds. If this befalls the emulator main
      thread, the response time is no longer in the order of
      milliseconds, depending on the definition of "soft" in soft
      real-time system.</p>
    <p>If the device driver thread pool is active, file operations are
      done through those threads instead, so the emulator can go on
      executing Erlang processes. Unfortunately, the time for serving a
      file operation increases due to the extra scheduling required
      from the operating system.</p>
    <p>If the device driver thread pool is disabled or of size 0, large
      file reads and writes are segmented into several smaller, which
      enables the emulator so server other processes during the file
      operation. This gives the same effect as when using the thread
      pool, but with larger overhead. Other file operations, for
      example <c>sync/1</c> or <c>close/1</c> on a huge file, still are
      a problem.</p>
    <p>For increased performance, raw files are recommended. Raw files
      uses the file system of the node's host machine. For normal files
      (non-raw), the file server is used to find the files, and if
      the node is running its file server as slave to another node's,
      and the other node runs on some other host machine, they may have
      different file systems. This is seldom a problem, but you have
      now been warned.</p>
    <p>A normal file is really a process so it can be used as an IO
      device (see <c>io</c>). Therefore when data is written to a
      normal file, the sending of the data to the file process, copies 
      all data that are not binaries. Opening the file in binary mode
      and writing binaries is therefore recommended. If the file is
      opened on another node, or if the file server runs as slave to
      another node's, also binaries are copied.</p>
    <p>Caching data to reduce the number of file operations, or rather
      the number of calls to the file driver, will generally increase
      performance. The following function writes 4 MBytes in 23
      seconds when tested:</p>
    <code type="none"><![CDATA[
create_file_slow(Name, N) when integer(N), N >= 0 ->
    {ok, FD} = file:open(Name, [raw, write, delayed_write, binary]),
    ok = create_file_slow(FD, 0, N),
    ok = ?FILE_MODULE:close(FD),
    ok.
      
create_file_slow(FD, M, M) ->
    ok;
create_file_slow(FD, M, N) ->
    ok = file:write(FD, <<M:32/unsigned>>),
    create_file_slow(FD, M+1, N).]]></code>
    <p>The following, functionally equivalent, function collects 1024
      entries into a list of 128 32-byte binaries before each call to
      <c>file:write/2</c> and so does the same work in 0.52 seconds,
      which is 44 times faster.</p>
    <code type="none"><![CDATA[
create_file(Name, N) when integer(N), N >= 0 ->
    {ok, FD} = file:open(Name, [raw, write, delayed_write, binary]),
    ok = create_file(FD, 0, N),
    ok = ?FILE_MODULE:close(FD),
    ok.
      
create_file(FD, M, M) ->
    ok;
create_file(FD, M, N) when M + 1024 =&lt; N ->
    create_file(FD, M, M + 1024, []),
    create_file(FD, M + 1024, N);
create_file(FD, M, N) ->
    create_file(FD, M, N, []).
      
create_file(FD, M, M, R) ->
    ok = file:write(FD, R);
create_file(FD, M, N0, R) when M + 8 =&lt; N0 ->
    N1  = N0-1,  N2  = N0-2,  N3  = N0-3,  N4  = N0-4, 
    N5  = N0-5,  N6  = N0-6,  N7  = N0-7,  N8  = N0-8, 
    create_file(FD, M, N8, 
                [<<N8:32/unsigned,  N7:32/unsigned, 
                   N6:32/unsigned,  N5:32/unsigned, 
                   N4:32/unsigned,  N3:32/unsigned, 
                   N2:32/unsigned,  N1:32/unsigned>> | R]);
create_file(FD, M, N0, R) ->
    N1 = N0-1,
    create_file(FD, M, N1, [<<N1:32/unsigned>> | R]).]]></code>
    <note>
      <p>Trust only your own benchmarks. If the list length in 
        <c>create_file/2</c> above is increased, it will run slightly
        faster, but consume more memory and cause more memory
        fragmentation. How much this affects your application is
        something that this simple benchmark can not predict.</p>
      <p>If the size of each binary is increased to 64 bytes, it will
        also run slightly faster, but the code will be twice as clumsy.
        In the current implementation are binaries larger than 64 bytes
        stored in memory common to all processes and not copied when
        sent between processes, while these smaller binaries are stored
        on the process heap and copied when sent like any other term.</p>
      <p>So, with a binary size of 68 bytes <c>create_file/2</c> runs
        30 percent slower then with 64 bytes, and will cause much more
        memory fragmentation. Note that if the binaries were to be sent
        between processes (for example a non-raw file) the results
        would probably be completely different.</p>
    </note>
    <p>A raw file is really a port. When writing data to a port, it is
      efficient to write a list of binaries. There is no need to
      flatten a deep list before writing. On Unix hosts, scatter output,
      which writes a set of buffers in one operation, is used when
      possible. In this way <c>file:write(FD, [Bin1, Bin2 | Bin3])</c>
      will write the contents of the binaries without copying the data
      at all except for perhaps deep down in the operating system
      kernel.</p>
    <p>For raw files, <c>pwrite/2</c> and <c>pread/2</c> are
      efficiently implemented. The file driver is called only once for
      the whole operation, and the list iteration is done in the file
      driver.</p>
    <p>The options <c>delayed_write</c> and <c>read_ahead</c> to 
      <c>file:open/2</c> makes the file driver cache data to reduce
      the number of operating system calls. The function
      <c>create_file/2</c> in the example above takes 60 seconds
      seconds without the <c>delayed_write</c> option, which is 2.6
      times slower.</p>
    <p>And, as a really bad example, <c>create_file_slow/2</c> above
      without the <c>raw</c>, <c>binary</c> and <c>delayed_write</c>
      options, that is it calls <c>file:open(Name, [write])</c>, needs
      1 min 20 seconds for the job, which is 3.5 times slower than
      the first example, and 150 times slower than the optimized
      <c>create_file/2</c>. </p>

    <title>Warnings</title>
    <p>If an error occurs when accessing an open file with the <c>io</c>
      module, the process which handles the file will exit. The dead
      file process might hang if a process tries to access it later.
      This will be fixed in a future release.</p>
