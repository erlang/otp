  <description>
    <p>In OTP, <em>application</em> denotes a component implementing
      some specific functionality, that can be started and stopped as a
      unit, and which can be re-used in other systems as well. This
      module interfaces the <em>application controller</em>, a process
      started at every Erlang runtime system, and contains functions
      for controlling applications (for example starting and stopping
      applications), and functions to access information about
      applications (for example configuration parameters).</p>
    <p>An application is defined by an <em>application specification</em>. The specification is normally located in an
      <em>application resource file</em> called <c>Application.app</c>,
      where <c>Application</c> is the name of the application. Refer to
      <seealso marker="app">app(4)</seealso> for more information about
      the application specification.</p>
    <p>This module can also be viewed as a behaviour for an application
      implemented according to the OTP design principles as a
      supervision tree. The definition of how to start and stop
      the tree should be located in an <em>application callback module</em> exporting a pre-defined set of functions.</p>
    <p>Refer to <seealso marker="doc/design_principles:des_princ">OTP Design Principles</seealso> for more information about
      applications and behaviours.</p>

      <desc>
        <p>Loads the application specification for an application into
          the application controller. It will also load the application
          specifications for any included applications. Note that
          the function does not load the actual Erlang object code.</p>
        <p>The application can be given by its name <c><anno>Application</anno></c>.
          In this case the application controller will search the code
          path for the application resource file <c><anno>Application</anno>.app</c>
          and load the specification it contains.</p>
        <p>The application specification can also be given directly as a
          tuple <c><anno>AppSpec</anno></c>. This tuple should have the format and
          contents as described in <c>app(4)</c>.</p>
        <p>If <c><anno>Distributed</anno> == {<anno>Application</anno>,[<anno>Time</anno>,]<anno>Nodes</anno>}</c>,
          the application will be distributed. The argument overrides
          the value for the application in the Kernel configuration
          parameter <c>distributed</c>. <c><anno>Application</anno></c> must be
          the name of the application (same as in the first argument).
          If a node crashes and <c><anno>Time</anno></c> has been specified, then
          the application controller will wait for <c><anno>Time</anno></c>
          milliseconds before attempting to restart the application on
          another node. If <c><anno>Time</anno></c> is not specified, it will
          default to 0 and the application will be restarted
          immediately.</p>
        <p><c><anno>Nodes</anno></c> is a list of node names where the application
          may run, in priority from left to right. Node names can be
          grouped using tuples to indicate that they have the same
          priority. Example:</p>
        <code type="none">
Nodes = [cp1@cave, {cp2@cave, cp3@cave}]</code>
        <p>This means that the application should preferably be started
          at <c>cp1@cave</c>. If <c>cp1@cave</c> is down,
          the application should be started at either <c>cp2@cave</c>
          or <c>cp3@cave</c>.</p>
        <p>If <c>Distributed == default</c>, the value for
          the application in the Kernel configuration parameter
          <c>distributed</c> will be used.</p>

      <name name="loaded_applications" arity="0"/>
      <fsummary>Get the currently loaded applications</fsummary>
      <desc>
        <p>Returns a list with information about the applications which
          have been loaded using <c>load/1,2</c>, also included
          applications. <c><anno>Application</anno></c> is the application name.
          <c><anno>Description</anno></c> and <c><anno>Vsn</anno></c> are the values of its
          <c>description</c> and <c>vsn</c> application specification
          keys, respectively.</p>
      </desc>
    </func>
    <func>
      <name name="permit" arity="2"/>
      <fsummary>Change an application's permission to run on a node.</fsummary>
      <desc>
        <p>Changes the permission for <c><anno>Application</anno></c> to run at
          the current node. The application must have been loaded using
          <c>load/1,2</c> for the function to have effect.</p>
        <p>If the permission of a loaded, but not started, application
          is set to <c>false</c>, <c>start</c> will return <c>ok</c> but
          the application will not be started until the permission is
          set to <c>true</c>.</p>
        <p>If the permission of a running application is set to
          <c>false</c>, the application will be stopped. If
          the permission later is set to <c>true</c>, it will be
          restarted.</p>
        <p>If the application is distributed, setting the permission to
          <c>false</c> means that the application will be started at, or
          moved to, another node according to how its distribution is
          configured (see <c>load/2</c> above).</p>
        <p>The function does not return until the application is
          started, stopped or successfully moved to another node.
          However, in some cases where permission is set to <c>true</c>
          the function may return <c>ok</c> even though the application
          itself has not started. This is true when an application
          cannot start because it has dependencies to other
          applications which have not yet been started. When they have
          been started, <c>Application</c> will be started as well.</p>
        <p>By default, all applications are loaded with permission
          <c>true</c> on all nodes. The permission is configurable by
          using the Kernel configuration parameter <c>permissions</c>.</p>

        <p>Sets the value of the configuration parameter <c><anno>Par</anno></c> for
          <c><anno>Application</anno></c>.</p>
        <p><c>set_env/4</c> uses the standard <c>gen_server</c> timeout
          value (5000 ms). The <c>timeout</c> option can be provided
          if another timeout value is useful, for example, in situations
          where the application controller is heavily loaded.</p>
        <p>If <c>set_env/4</c> is called before the application is loaded,
          the application environment values specified in the <c>Application.app</c>
          file will override the ones previously set. This is also true for application
          reloads.</p>
        <p>The <c>persistent</c> option can be set to <c>true</c>
          when there is a need to guarantee parameters set with <c>set_env/4</c>
          will not be overridden by the ones defined in the application resource
          file on load. This means persistent values will stick after the application
          is loaded and also on application reload.</p>
        <warning>
          <p>Use this function only if you know what you are doing, 
            that is, on your own applications. It is very application
            and configuration parameter dependent when and how often
            the value is read by the application, and careless use 
            of this function may put the application in a 
            weird, inconsistent, and malfunctioning state. </p>

               application (which are however omitted from the <c>AppNames</c> list), and reports
               <c>{error, {AppName,Reason}}</c> for errors, where <c>Reason</c> is any possible reason

          the application controller will first load it using
          <c>load/1</c>. It will make sure any included applications
          are loaded, but will not start them. That is assumed to be
          taken care of in the code for <c><anno>Application</anno></c>.</p>
        <p>The application controller checks the value of
          the application specification key <c>applications</c>, to
          ensure that all applications that should be started before

        <p>The application controller then creates an <em>application master</em> for the application. The application master is
          the group leader of all the processes in the application.
          The application master starts the application by calling
