  <modulesummary>Interface to TCP/IP sockets.</modulesummary>
  <description>
    <p>This module provides functions for communicating
      with sockets using the TCP/IP protocol.</p>
    <p>The following code fragment is a simple example of
      a client connecting to a server at port 5678, transferring a
      binary, and closing the connection:</p>
    <code type="none">
client() ->
    SomeHostInNet = "localhost", % to make it runnable on one machine
    {ok, Sock} = gen_tcp:connect(SomeHostInNet, 5678, 
                                 [binary, {packet, 0}]),
    ok = gen_tcp:send(Sock, "Some Data"),
    ok = gen_tcp:close(Sock).</code>
    <p>At the other end, a server is listening on port 5678, accepts
      the connection, and receives the binary:</p>
    <code type="none">
server() ->
    {ok, LSock} = gen_tcp:listen(5678, [binary, {packet, 0}, 
                                        {active, false}]),
    {ok, Sock} = gen_tcp:accept(LSock),
    {ok, Bin} = do_recv(Sock, []),
    ok = gen_tcp:close(Sock),
    ok = gen_tcp:close(LSock),
    Bin.

do_recv(Sock, Bs) ->
    case gen_tcp:recv(Sock, 0) of
        {ok, B} ->
            do_recv(Sock, [Bs, B]);
        {error, closed} ->
            {ok, list_to_binary(Bs)}
    end.</code>

    <seeerl marker="#examples">Examples</seeerl>.</p>

    <note>
      <p>
        Functions that create sockets can take an optional option;
        <c>{inet_backend,&nbsp;Backend}</c> that, if specified,
        has to be the first option.  This selects
        the implementation backend towards the platform's socket API.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a <em>temporary</em> option
        that will be ignored in a future release.
      </p>
      <p>
        The default is <c>Backend&nbsp;=&nbsp;inet</c>
        that selects the traditional <c>inet_drv.c</c> driver.
        The other choice is <c>Backend&nbsp;=&nbsp;socket</c>
        that selects the new <seeerl marker="socket"><c>socket</c></seeerl>
        module and its NIF implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system default can be changed when the node is started
        with the application <c>kernel</c>'s configuration variable
        <c>inet_backend</c>.
      </p>
      <p>For <c>gen_tcp</c> with <c>inet_backend = socket</c> we have tried
      to be as "compatible" as possible which has sometimes been impossible.
      Here is a list of cases when the behaviour of inet-backend
      <c>inet</c> (default) and <c>socket</c> are different: </p>
      <list type="bulleted">
        <item>
	  <p><seeerl marker="#non_blocking_send">Non-blocking send</seeerl></p>
	  <p>If a user calling
	  <seemfa marker="#send/2"><c>gen_tcp:send/2</c></seemfa>     
	  with <c>inet_backend = inet</c>,
	  tries to send more data than there is room for in the OS buffers,
	  the "rest data" is buffered by the inet driver (and later sent in the
	  background).
	  The effect for the user is that the call is non-blocking.</p>
	  <p>This is <em>not</em> the effect when
	  <c>inet_backend = socket</c>, since there is no buffering.
	  Instead the user hangs either until all data has been sent or the
	  <c>send_timeout</c> timeout has been reached. </p>
	</item>

	<item><p>Remote close detected by background send. </p>
	<p>An background send will detect a 'remote close' and
	(the inet driver will) mark the socket as 'closed'.
	No other action is taken.
	If the socket has <c>active</c> set to <c>false</c> (passive) at
	this point and no one is reading, this will not be noticed.
	But as soon as the socket is "activated" (<c>active</c> set to
	not <c>false</c>,
	<seemfa marker="#send/2">send/2</seemfa>
	is called or
	<seemfa marker="#recv/2">recv/2,3</seemfa>
	is called),
	an error message will be sent to the
	caller or (socket) owner: <c>{tcp_error, Socket, econnreset}</c>.
	Any data in the OS receive buffers will be lost! </p>
	<p>This behaviour is <em>not</em> replicated by the socket
	implementation.
	A send operation will detect a remote close and immediately
	return this to the caller, but do nothing else.
	A reader will therefor be able to extract any data from the OS buffers.
	If the socket is set to <c>active</c> to not <c>false</c>, the data
	will be received as expected (<c>{tcp, ...}</c> and then a closed
	message (<c>{tcp_closed, ...}</c> will be received (not an error). </p>
	</item>

        <item>
	  <p>The option
	  <seeerl marker="inet#option-show_econnreset">show_econnreset</seeerl>
	  basically do <em>not</em>
	  work as described when used with <c>inet_backend = socket</c>.
	  The "issue" is that a remote close (as described above)
	  <em>do</em> allow a reader to extract what is in the read buffers
	  before a close is "delivered".</p>
	</item>

        <item>
	  <p>The option
	  <seeerl marker="inet#option-nodelay">nodelay</seeerl>
	  is a TCP specific option that is <em>not</em> compatible with
	  <c>domain = local</c>. </p>
	  <p>When using <c>inet_backend = socket</c>, trying to create a socket
	  (via listen or connect) with <c>domain = local</c>
	  (for example with option {ifaddr, {local,"/tmp/test"}})
	  <em>will fail</em> with <c>{error, enotsup}</c>. </p>
	  <p>This does not actually work for <c>inet_backend = inet</c> either,
	  but in that case the error is simply <em>ignored</em>,
	  which is a <em>bad</em> idea. We have choosen to <em>not</em>
	  ignore this error for <c>inet_backend = socket</c>. </p>

	  <p>Calling
	  <seemfa marker="#shutdown/2">gen_tcp:shutdown(Socket, write | read_write)</seemfa>

	  will take <em>immediate</em> effect,

	  If the platform implements the IPv4 option

	<note>
	  <p>
	    This option appears to be VERY Linux specific,
	    and its existence in future Linux kernel versions
	    is also worrying since the option is part of RFC 2292
	    which is since long (2003) obsoleted by RFC 3542
	    that <em>explicitly</em> removes this possibility to get
	    packet information from a stream socket.
	    For comparision: it has existed in FreeBSD but is now removed,
	    at least since FreeBSD 10.

	  <p>If this happens when using <c>packet =/= raw</c>, we have a partial

	  from the data portion of the current package. Instead, set package
	  to raw, send the rest data (as raw data) and then set package to

    <p>The following example illustrates use of option
    <c>{active,once}</c> and multiple accepts by implementing a server
    as a number of worker processes doing accept on a single listening
    socket. Function <c>start/2</c> takes the number of worker
    processes and the port number on which to listen for incoming
    connections. If <c>LPort</c> is specified as <c>0</c>, an
    ephemeral port number is used, which is why the start function
    returns the actual port number allocated:</p>
    <code type="none">
start(Num,LPort) ->
    case gen_tcp:listen(LPort,[{active, false},{packet,2}]) of
        {ok, ListenSock} ->
            start_servers(Num,ListenSock),
            {ok, Port} = inet:port(ListenSock),
            Port;
        {error,Reason} ->
            {error,Reason}
    end.

start_servers(0,_) ->
    ok;
start_servers(Num,LS) ->
    spawn(?MODULE,server,[LS]),
    start_servers(Num-1,LS).

server(LS) ->
    case gen_tcp:accept(LS) of
        {ok,S} ->
            loop(S),
            server(LS);
        Other ->
            io:format("accept returned ~w - goodbye!~n",[Other]),
            ok
    end.

loop(S) ->
    inet:setopts(S,[{active,once}]),
    receive
        {tcp,S,Data} ->
            Answer = process(Data), % Not implemented in this example
            gen_tcp:send(S,Answer),
            loop(S);
        {tcp_closed,S} ->
            io:format("Socket ~w closed [~w]~n",[S,self()]),
            ok
    end.</code>
    <p>Example of a simple client:</p>
    <code type="none">
client(PortNo,Message) ->
    {ok,Sock} = gen_tcp:connect("localhost",PortNo,[{active,false},
                                                    {packet,2}]),
    gen_tcp:send(Sock,Message),
    A = gen_tcp:recv(Sock,0),
    gen_tcp:close(Sock),
    A.</code>
    <p>The <c>send</c> call does not accept a time-out
      option because time-outs on send is handled through socket
      option <c>send_timeout</c>. The behavior of a send operation with
      no receiver is mainly defined by the underlying TCP
      stack and the network infrastructure. To write
      code that handles a hanging receiver that can eventually cause
      the sender to hang on a <c>send</c> do like the following.</p>
    <p>Consider a process that receives data from a client process
      to be forwarded to a server on the network. The process is
      connected to the server through TCP/IP and does not get any acknowledge
      for each message it sends, but has to rely on the send time-out
      option to detect that the other end is unresponsive. Option
      <c>send_timeout</c> can be used when connecting:</p>
    <code type="none">
...
{ok,Sock} = gen_tcp:connect(HostAddress, Port,
                            [{active,false},
                             {send_timeout, 5000},
                             {packet,2}]),
                loop(Sock), % See below
...</code>
    <p>In the loop where requests are handled, send time-outs can now be
      detected:</p>
    <code type="none">
loop(Sock) ->
    receive
        {Client, send_data, Binary} ->
            case gen_tcp:send(Sock,[Binary]) of
                {error, timeout} ->
                    io:format("Send timeout, closing!~n",
                              []),
                    handle_send_timeout(), % Not implemented here
                    Client ! {self(),{error_sending, timeout}},
                    %% Usually, it's a good idea to give up in case of a 
                    %% send timeout, as you never know how much actually 
                    %% reached the server, maybe only a packet header?!
                    gen_tcp:close(Sock);
                {error, OtherSendError} ->
                    io:format("Some other error on socket (~p), closing",
                              [OtherSendError]),
                    Client ! {self(),{error_sending, OtherSendError}},
                    gen_tcp:close(Sock);
                ok ->
                    Client ! {self(), data_sent},
                    loop(Sock)
            end
    end.</code>
    <p>Usually it suffices to detect time-outs on receive, as most
      protocols include some sort of acknowledgment from the server,
      but if the protocol is strictly one way, option <c>send_timeout</c>
      comes in handy.</p>
