	TEST SUITE REQUIREMENTS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
As third party products are involved when using ODBC you will have to
setup your own test environment to be able to run the ODBC test
suites.

You need to install a database such as postgres, sql-server, oracle
etc, and ODBC-drivers for that database. 

Then you need to setup a test database, however you do not
need to create any tables that will be done by the test suites.
The test suites will also remove all tables that it creates when
the test is complete.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
ERLANG FILES YOU MAY NEED TO CHANGE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

A remote database management system has a callback module to handle
possible differences in data type handling etc, the callback module
also defines the ODBC connection string. Currently available callback
modules are postgres.erl, sqlserver.erl and oracle.erl. Depending on
how you set things up you might want to edit the connection string in
the callback module or even add your own callback module.

The callback module used in each test case is defined by the ?RDBMS
macro defined in odbc_test.hrl so you might need to change this to
suite your purposes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXAMPLE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

As an example say we have the database odbctestdb, with
the user odbctest that has the password Sesame. The database
runs on the host myhost.

UINX/LINUX
-----------

Set up a database and install the unixODBC drivers. 
Then the unix/linux user that should run the test suits needs an .odbc.ini
file to map connection data. For example ODBC connection string:
"DSN=Postgres;UID=odbctest" will need an .odbc.ini entry that looks
something like this:

--- Start example of .odbc.ini ----

[Postgres]
Driver=/usr/lib/psqlodbc.so 
Description=Postgres driver
ServerName=myhost
Database=odbctestdb
Port=5432
LogonID=odbctest
Password=Sesame

---End example of .odbc.ini ------------


WINDOWS MOST FLAVORS
--------------------

There will be a "ODBC data source administrator" tool under
Control Panel -> Administrative Tools, use this to set up
your database. Choose to connect with SQL Server authentication.
As odbc connection string use: "DSN=odbctestdb;UID=odbctest;PWD=Sesame"
