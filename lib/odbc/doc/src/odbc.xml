  <description>
    <p>This application provides an Erlang interface to communicate
      with relational SQL-databases. It is built on top of Microsofts
      ODBC interface and therefore requires that you have an ODBC driver
      to the database that you want to connect to.</p>
    <note>
      <p>The functions <c>first/[1,2]</c>, <c>last/[1,2]</c>,
        <c>next/[1,2]</c>, <c>prev[1,2]</c> and <c>select/[3,4]</c>
        assumes there is a result set associated with the connection to
        work on. Calling the function <c>select_count/[2,3]</c>
        associates such a result set with the connection. Calling
        select_count again will remove the current result set
        association and create a new one. Calling a function which dose
        not operate on an associated result sets, such as
        <c>sql_query/[2,3]</c>, will remove the current result set
        association.</p>
      <p>Alas some drivers only support sequential traversal of the
        result set, e.i. they do not support what in the ODBC world is
        known as scrollable cursors. This will have the effect that
        functions such as <c>first/[1,2]</c>, <c>last/[1,2]</c>,
        <c>prev[1,2]</c>, etc will return <c>{error, driver_does_not_support_function}</c></p>

    <title>COMMON DATA TYPES </title>
    <p>Here follows type definitions that are used by more than one
      function in the ODBC API. </p>
    <note>
      <p>The type <c>TimeOut</c> has the default value
        <c>infinity</c>, so for instance:        <br></br>

        commit(Ref, CommitMode) is the same as
        commit(Ref, CommitMode, infinity). If the
        timeout expires the client will exit with the reason
        timeout. </p>

    <title>ERROR HANDLING </title>
    <p>The error handling strategy and possible errors sources are

      <type>
        <v>ConnectStr = string()</v>
        <d>An example of a connection string: <c>"DSN=sql-server;UID=aladdin;PWD=sesame"</c> where DSN is your ODBC Data Source Name, UID is a database user id and PWD is the password for that user. These are usually the attributes required in the connection string, but some drivers have other driver specific attributes, for example <c>"DSN=Oracle8;DBQ=gandalf;UID=aladdin;PWD=sesame"</c> where DBQ is your TNSNAMES.ORA entry name e.g. some Oracle specific configuration attribute.</d>
        <v>Options = [] | [option()]</v>
        <d>All options has default values. </d>
        <v>option() = {auto_commit, on | off} | {timeout, milliseconds()}

      </type>
      <desc>
        <p>Opens a connection to the database. The connection is
          associated with the process that created it and can only be
          accessed through it. This function may spawn new processes
          to handle the connection. These processes will terminate if
          the process that created the connection dies or if you call
          disconnect/1.</p>
	    
	  <p>If automatic commit mode is turned on, each query will be
          considered as an individual transaction and will be
          automatically committed after it has been executed. If you want
          more than one query to be part of the same transaction the automatic
          commit mode should be turned off. Then you will have to call
          commit/3 explicitly to end a transaction. </p>

	  <p>The default timeout is infinity </p>
	  
	  <p> >If the option binary_strings is turned on all strings
	  will be returned as binaries and strings inputed to
	  param_query will be expected to be binaries. The user needs
	  to ensure that the binary is in an encoding that the
	  database expects. By default this option is turned off.</p>
	  
        <p>As default result sets are returned as a lists of
          tuples. The <c>TupleMode</c> option still exists to keep some
          degree of backwards compatibility. If the option is set to
          off, result sets will be returned as a lists of lists
          instead of a lists of tuples.</p>
	  
        <p>Scrollable cursors are nice but causes some overhead. For
          some connections speed might be more important than flexible
          data access and then you can disable scrollable cursor for a
          connection, limiting the API but gaining speed.</p>

	  <note><p>Turning the scrollable_cursors option off is noted
	  to make old odbc-drivers able to connect that will otherwhise fail.</p></note>
	  
        <p>If trace mode is turned on this tells the ODBC driver to
          write a trace log to the file SQL.LOG that is placed in the
          current directory of the erlang emulator. This information
          may be useful if you suspect there might be a bug in the
          erlang ODBC application, and it might be relevant for you to
          send this file to our support. Otherwise you will probably
          not have much use of this.</p>
	  
        <note>
          <p>For more information about the <c>ConnectStr</c> see
            description of the function SQLDriverConnect in [1].</p>
        </note>

		  <p>The <c>extended_errors</c> option enables extended ODBC error
			  information when an operation fails. Rather than returning <c>{error, Reason}</c>,
			  the failing function will reutrn <c>{error, {ODBCErrorCode, NativeErrorCode, Reason}}</c>.
			  Note that this information is probably of little use when writing database-independent code,
			  but can be of assistance in providing more sophisticated error handling when dealing with
			  a known underlying database.
	           </p>
			 <list type="bulleted">
				  <item><c>ODBCErrorCode</c> is the ODBC error string returned by the ODBC driver.</item>
				  <item><c>NativeErrorCode</c> is the numberic error code returned by the underlying database. The possible values
					  and their meanings are dependent on the database being used.</item>
				  <item><c>Reason</c> is as per the <c>Reason</c> field when extended errors are not enabled.</item>
		  </list>

        <note>
            <p>The current implementation spawns a port programm
            written in C that utilizes the actual ODBC driver. There
            is a default timeout of 5000 msec for this port programm
            to connect to the Erlang ODBC application. This timeout
            can be changed by setting an application specific
            environment variable 'port_timeout' with the number of
            milliseconds for the ODBC application. E.g.: [{odbc,
            [{port_timeout, 60000}]}] to set it to 60 seconds.

        <p>Selects <c>N</c> consecutive rows of the result set. If
          <c>Position</c> is <c>next</c> it is semantically equivalent
          of calling <c>next/[1,2]</c> <c>N</c> times. If
          <c>Position</c> is <c>{relative, Pos}</c>, <c>Pos</c> will be
          used as an offset from the current cursor position to
          determine the first selected row. If <c>Position</c> is
          <c>{absolute, Pos}</c>, <c>Pos</c> will be the number of the
          first row selected. After this function has returned the
          cursor is positioned at the last selected row. If there is
          less then <c>N</c> rows left of the result set the length of
          <c>Rows</c> will be less than <c>N</c>. If the first row to
          select happens to be beyond the last row of the result set,
          the returned value will be <c>{selected, ColNames,[]}</c>
          e.i. the list of row values is empty indicating that there
          is no more data to fetch.</p>
