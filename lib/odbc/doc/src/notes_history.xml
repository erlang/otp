          <p>The erlang odbc process will now die normally if a
            connection cannot be established. No connection no
            process it is expected. And as the client has already
            received the error message that would be the reason with
            which the erlang process would be stopped, the supervisor
            report will be superfluous. Naturally you may still get
            supervisor reports if the erlang process is stopped for
            any other reason than the above.</p>

          <p>The Erlang ODBC application consists of both Erlang and C
            code. The C code is delivered as a precompiled executable
            for windows and solaris. For the purpose of recompilation
            or compiling on some other platform there is a Makefile
            included.</p>
