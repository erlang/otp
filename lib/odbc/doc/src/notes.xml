	    ODBC now handles the types SQL_WCHAR and SQL_WVARCHAR.
	    ODBC also has a new connection option to return all
	    strings as binaries and also expect strings to be
	    binaries in the param_query function. This provides some
	  but not a full unicode support.</p>

    <section><title>Improvements and New Features</title>
      <list>
        <item>
	    <p>Cross compilation improvements and other build system
	    improvements.</p>
	    <p>Most notable:</p> <list><item> Lots of cross
	    compilation improvements. The old cross compilation
	    support was more or less non-existing as well as broken.
	    Please, note that the cross compilation support should
	    still be considered as experimental. Also note that old
	    cross compilation configurations cannot be used without
	    modifications. For more information on cross compiling
	    Erlang/OTP see the <c>$ERL_TOP/INSTALL-CROSS.md</c> file.
	    </item><item> Support for staged install using <url
	    href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/DESTDIR.html">DESTDIR</url>.
	    The old broken <c>INSTALL_PREFIX</c> has also been fixed.
	    For more information see the <c>$ERL_TOP/INSTALL.md</c>
	    file. </item><item> Documentation of the <c>release</c>
	    target of the top <c>Makefile</c>. For more information
	    see the <c>$ERL_TOP/INSTALL.md</c> file. </item><item>
	    <c>make install</c> now by default creates relative
	    symbolic links instead of absolute ones. For more
	    information see the <c>$ERL_TOP/INSTALL.md</c> file.
	    </item><item> <c>$ERL_TOP/configure --help=recursive</c>
	    now works and prints help for all applications with
	    <c>configure</c> scripts. </item><item> Doing <c>make
	    install</c>, or <c>make release</c> directly after
	    <c>make all</c> no longer triggers miscellaneous
	    rebuilds. </item><item> Existing bootstrap system is now
	    used when doing <c>make install</c>, or <c>make
	    release</c> without a preceding <c>make all</c>.
	    </item><item> The <c>crypto</c> and <c>ssl</c>
	    applications use the same runtime library path when
	    dynamically linking against <c>libssl.so</c> and
	    <c>libcrypto.so</c>. The runtime library search path has
	    also been extended. </item><item> The <c>configure</c>
	    scripts of <c>erl_interface</c> and <c>odbc</c> now
	    search for thread libraries and thread library quirks the
	    same way as <c>erts</c> do. </item><item> The
	    <c>configure</c> script of the <c>odbc</c> application
	    now also looks for odbc libraries in <c>lib64</c> and
	    <c>lib/64</c> directories when building on a 64-bit
	    system. </item><item> The <c>config.h.in</c> file in the
	    <c>erl_interface</c> application is now automatically
	    generated in instead of statically updated which reduces
	    the risk of <c>configure</c> tests without any effect.
	    </item></list>
	    <p>(Thanks to Henrik Riomar for suggestions and
	    testing)</p>
	    <p>(Thanks to Winston Smith for the AVR32-Linux cross
	    configuration and testing)</p>

        <item>
	    <p>The documentation is now possible to build in an open
	    source environment after a number of bugs are fixed and
	    some features are added in the documentation build
	    process. </p>
	    <p>- The arity calculation is updated.</p>
	    <p>- The module prefix used in the function names for
	    bif's are removed in the generated links so the links
	    will look like
	    "http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#append_element-2"
	    instead of
	    "http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#erlang:append_element-2".</p>
	    <p>- Enhanced the menu positioning in the html
	    documentation when a new page is loaded.</p>
	    <p>- A number of corrections in the generation of man
	    pages (thanks to Sergei Golovan)</p>
	    <p>- The legal notice is taken from the xml book file so
	    OTP's build process can be used for non OTP
	    applications.</p>

            visible change is that the frames are removed.</p>

          <p>
            The odbc application now has to be explicitly started and
            stopped e.i. it will not automatically be started as a
            temporary application as it did before. Although a
            practical feature when testing things in the shell, it is
            not desirable that people take advantage of this and not
            start the odbc application in a correct way in their
            products. Added functions to the odbc API that calls
            application:start/stop.</p>

            Changed Makefile.in so that odbc is not disabled on
            64-bits architectures. It was earlier disabled due to
            that it had never been tested in that environment.</p>

          <p>The port program now sends different exit codes to Erlang
            when it exits due to failure. This instead of sending the
            same exit code and then trying to write to stderr. Erlang
            encodes the exit code to a descriptive atom.</p>

          <p>Result sets are now by default returned as a list of
            tuples which is the most intuitive and useful mapping. To
            keep some degree of backwards compatibility you may turn
            this off to get the old behavior that result sets are
            returned as lists of lists. However do not use this in
            new code as it is considered a deprecated feature that
            eventually will disappear.</p>

          <p>The odbc implementation now mostly uses sockets to
            communicate between the c and the erlang process, this is
            to avoid a lot of problems arising from different
            odbc-drivers doing strange things that disturbed the
            port-program communication mechanism.</p>
