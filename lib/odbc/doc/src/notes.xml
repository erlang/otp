    <section><title>Improvements and New Features</title>

        <item>
          <p>
	    Ipv6 is now supported on Windows as well as on UNIX for
	    internal socket communication. (ODBC uses sockets instead
	    of the "Erlang port pipes" as some ODBC-drivers are known
	    to mess with stdin/stdout.) </p>
          <p>
	    Loopback address constants are used when connecting the
	    c-side to the erlang-side over local socket API avoiding
	    getaddrinfo problems, and the {ip, loopback} option is
	    added as a listen option on the erlang-side. Also cleaned
	    up the TIME_STAMP contribution.</p>

          <p>
            ODBC now handles the types SQL_WCHAR and SQL_WVARCHAR.
            Thanks to Juhani Ränkimies. ODBC also has a new
            connection option to return all strings as binaries and
            also expect strings to be binaries in the param_query
            function. These changes provides some unicode support.</p>

            DD}, {HH, MM, SS}}. Thanks to Juhani Ränkimies.</p>

        <item>
	    <p>Cross compilation improvements and other build system
	    improvements.</p>
	    <p>Most notable:</p> <list><item> Lots of cross
	    compilation improvements. The old cross compilation
	    support was more or less non-existing as well as broken.
	    Please, note that the cross compilation support should
	    still be considered as experimental. Also note that old
	    cross compilation configurations cannot be used without
	    modifications. For more information on cross compiling
	    Erlang/OTP see the <c>$ERL_TOP/INSTALL-CROSS.md</c> file.
	    </item><item> Support for staged install using <url
	    href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/DESTDIR.html">DESTDIR</url>.
	    The old broken <c>INSTALL_PREFIX</c> has also been fixed.
	    For more information see the <c>$ERL_TOP/INSTALL.md</c>
	    file. </item><item> Documentation of the <c>release</c>
	    target of the top <c>Makefile</c>. For more information
	    see the <c>$ERL_TOP/INSTALL.md</c> file. </item><item>
	    <c>make install</c> now by default creates relative
	    symbolic links instead of absolute ones. For more
	    information see the <c>$ERL_TOP/INSTALL.md</c> file.
	    </item><item> <c>$ERL_TOP/configure --help=recursive</c>
	    now works and prints help for all applications with
	    <c>configure</c> scripts. </item><item> Doing <c>make
	    install</c>, or <c>make release</c> directly after
	    <c>make all</c> no longer triggers miscellaneous
	    rebuilds. </item><item> Existing bootstrap system is now
	    used when doing <c>make install</c>, or <c>make
	    release</c> without a preceding <c>make all</c>.
	    </item><item> The <c>crypto</c> and <c>ssl</c>
	    applications use the same runtime library path when
	    dynamically linking against <c>libssl.so</c> and
	    <c>libcrypto.so</c>. The runtime library search path has
	    also been extended. </item><item> The <c>configure</c>
	    scripts of <c>erl_interface</c> and <c>odbc</c> now
	    search for thread libraries and thread library quirks the
	    same way as <c>erts</c> do. </item><item> The
	    <c>configure</c> script of the <c>odbc</c> application
	    now also looks for odbc libraries in <c>lib64</c> and
	    <c>lib/64</c> directories when building on a 64-bit
	    system. </item><item> The <c>config.h.in</c> file in the
	    <c>erl_interface</c> application is now automatically
	    generated in instead of statically updated which reduces
	    the risk of <c>configure</c> tests without any effect.
	    </item></list>
	    <p>(Thanks to Henrik Riomar for suggestions and
	    testing)</p>
	    <p>(Thanks to Winston Smith for the AVR32-Linux cross
	    configuration and testing)</p>

	    <p>The documentation is now possible to build in an open
	    source environment after a number of bugs are fixed and
	    some features are added in the documentation build
	    process. </p>
	    <p>- The arity calculation is updated.</p>
	    <p>- The module prefix used in the function names for
	    bif's are removed in the generated links so the links
	    will look like
	    "http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#append_element-2"
	    instead of
	    "http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#erlang:append_element-2".</p>
	    <p>- Enhanced the menu positioning in the html
	    documentation when a new page is loaded.</p>
	    <p>- A number of corrections in the generation of man
	    pages (thanks to Sergei Golovan)</p>
	    <p>- The legal notice is taken from the xml book file so
	    OTP's build process can be used for non OTP
	    applications.</p>

            The odbc application now has to be explicitly started and
            stopped e.i. it will not automatically be started as a
            temporary application as it did before. Although a
            practical feature when testing things in the shell, it is
            not desirable that people take advantage of this and not
            start the odbc application in a correct way in their
            products. Added functions to the odbc API that calls
            application:start/stop.</p>

            Changed Makefile.in so that odbc is not disabled on

          <p>/usr was added as a default place for configure to look
            for the odbc library on unix/linux platforms.</p>

          <p>A legacy timer in the c port program was set to infinity.
            All timeout handling is handled by the erlang code and a
            extra timeout in the c code will just lead to confusion
            if it is released.</p>

            the data is inserted in the table on the sql-server but
            for some reason the connection is lost.</p>

      <title>Improvements and New Features</title>
      <list type="bulleted">
        <item>
          <p>odbc now uses configure as all "normal" applications
            instead of providing special Makefiles for each
            commercial supported platform. This also makes it easier
            to build odbc on non supported platforms.</p>

          <p>Added use of the socket option TCP_NODELAY, as in the
            case of Erlang odbc the Nagel algorithm will never help,
            but always cause an unnecessary delay.</p>

        <item>
          <p>The port program now sends different exit codes to Erlang
            when it exits due to failure. This instead of sending the
            same exit code and then trying to write to stderr. Erlang
            encodes the exit code to a descriptive atom.</p>

          <p>Erlang ODBC now supports parameterized queries for the

          <p>Result sets are now by default returned as a list of
            tuples which is the most intuitive and useful mapping. To
            keep some degree of backwards compatibility you may turn
            this off to get the old behavior that result sets are
            returned as lists of lists. However do not use this in
            new code as it is considered a deprecated feature that
            eventually will disappear.</p>

        <item>
          <p>The odbc implementation now mostly uses sockets to
            communicate between the c and the erlang process, this is
            to avoid a lot of problems arising from different
            odbc-drivers doing strange things that disturbed the
            port-program communication mechanism.</p>
