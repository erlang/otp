          <p>
	    New application variable to set timeout of internal
	    communication setup between the erlang code and the
	    c-port program that interfaces the odbc driver. This can
	    be useful if you have an underlying system that is slow
	    due to heavy load at startup.</p>
          <p>
	    With this environment variable you can easily bypass and
	    tailor odbc to the needs of the underlying actual system
	    without changing the configuration. Which is a good thing
	    because this value is very system specific.</p>

	    Application upgrade (appup) files are corrected for the
	    following applications: </p>
          <p>
	    <c>asn1, common_test, compiler, crypto, debugger,

	    xmerl</c></p>
          <p>
	    A new test utility for testing appup files is added to
	    test_server. This is now used by most applications in
	    OTP.</p>

	    An ODBC process should exit normally if its client exits
	    with 'shutdown'</p>
          <p>
	    There is nothing strange about the client shutting down,
	    so the ODBC process should exit normally to avoid
	    generating a crash report for a non-problem. (Thanks to

	    Ipv6 is now supported on Windows as well as on UNIX for
	    internal socket communication. (ODBC uses sockets instead
	    of the "Erlang port pipes" as some ODBC-drivers are known
	    to mess with stdin/stdout.) </p>
          <p>
	    Loopback address constants are used when connecting the
	    c-side to the erlang-side over local socket API avoiding
	    getaddrinfo problems, and the {ip, loopback} option is
	    added as a listen option on the erlang-side. Also cleaned
	    up the TIME_STAMP contribution.</p>

            ODBC now handles the types SQL_WCHAR and SQL_WVARCHAR.
            Thanks to Juhani Ränkimies. ODBC also has a new
            connection option to return all strings as binaries and
            also expect strings to be binaries in the param_query
            function. These changes provides some unicode support.</p>

	    <p>Cross compilation improvements and other build system
	    improvements.</p>
	    <p>Most notable:</p> <list><item> Lots of cross
	    compilation improvements. The old cross compilation
	    support was more or less non-existing as well as broken.
	    Please, note that the cross compilation support should
	    still be considered as experimental. Also note that old
	    cross compilation configurations cannot be used without
	    modifications. For more information on cross compiling
	    Erlang/OTP see the <c>$ERL_TOP/INSTALL-CROSS.md</c> file.
	    </item><item> Support for staged install using <url
	    href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/DESTDIR.html">DESTDIR</url>.
	    The old broken <c>INSTALL_PREFIX</c> has also been fixed.
	    For more information see the <c>$ERL_TOP/INSTALL.md</c>
	    file. </item><item> Documentation of the <c>release</c>
	    target of the top <c>Makefile</c>. For more information
	    see the <c>$ERL_TOP/INSTALL.md</c> file. </item><item>
	    <c>make install</c> now by default creates relative
	    symbolic links instead of absolute ones. For more
	    information see the <c>$ERL_TOP/INSTALL.md</c> file.
	    </item><item> <c>$ERL_TOP/configure --help=recursive</c>
	    now works and prints help for all applications with
	    <c>configure</c> scripts. </item><item> Doing <c>make
	    install</c>, or <c>make release</c> directly after
	    <c>make all</c> no longer triggers miscellaneous
	    rebuilds. </item><item> Existing bootstrap system is now
	    used when doing <c>make install</c>, or <c>make
	    release</c> without a preceding <c>make all</c>.
	    </item><item> The <c>crypto</c> and <c>ssl</c>
	    applications use the same runtime library path when
	    dynamically linking against <c>libssl.so</c> and
	    <c>libcrypto.so</c>. The runtime library search path has
	    also been extended. </item><item> The <c>configure</c>
	    scripts of <c>erl_interface</c> and <c>odbc</c> now
	    search for thread libraries and thread library quirks the
	    same way as <c>erts</c> do. </item><item> The
	    <c>configure</c> script of the <c>odbc</c> application
	    now also looks for odbc libraries in <c>lib64</c> and
	    <c>lib/64</c> directories when building on a 64-bit
	    system. </item><item> The <c>config.h.in</c> file in the
	    <c>erl_interface</c> application is now automatically
	    generated in instead of statically updated which reduces
	    the risk of <c>configure</c> tests without any effect.
	    </item></list>
	    <p>(Thanks to Henrik Riomar for suggestions and
	    testing)</p>

	    <p>The documentation is now possible to build in an open
	    source environment after a number of bugs are fixed and
	    some features are added in the documentation build
	    process. </p>
	    <p>- The arity calculation is updated.</p>
	    <p>- The module prefix used in the function names for
	    bif's are removed in the generated links so the links
	    will look like
	    "http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#append_element-2"
	    instead of

            The odbc application now has to be explicitly started and
            stopped e.i. it will not automatically be started as a
            temporary application as it did before. Although a
            practical feature when testing things in the shell, it is
            not desirable that people take advantage of this and not
            start the odbc application in a correct way in their
            products. Added functions to the odbc API that calls
            application:start/stop.</p>
