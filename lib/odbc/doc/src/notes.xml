            The documentation is now built with open source tools
            (xsltproc and fop) that exists on most platforms. One
            visible change is that the frames are removed.</p>

            Erlang R12B-2 on Linux (SuSE 10.3), MySQL 5.0.45, myodbc
            3.51 and unixODBC 2.2.12. Earlier it could happen that an
            error was returned even though data was correctly
            inserted into the database.</p>

            Enhanced configure to among other things work better when
            there is a library found but it is not usable e.i. 32 bit
            library in 64 bit build.</p>

          <p>
            The odbc application now has to be explicitly started and
            stopped e.i. it will not automatically be started as a
            temporary application as it did before. Although a
            practical feature when testing things in the shell, it is
            not desirable that people take advantage of this and not
            start the odbc application in a correct way in their
            products. Added functions to the odbc API that calls
            application:start/stop.</p>

            Changed Makefile.in so that odbc is not disabled on
            64-bits architectures. It was earlier disabled due to
            that it had never been tested in that environment.</p>

          <p>When using a parameterized query on a windows platform
            the data was inserted in the table on the sql-server but
            the connection was lost, this seems to be due to a
            compiler error that has now been worked around, but
            further investigation is ongoing to verify that that
            really was the problem.</p>

          <p>Result sets are now by default returned as a list of

            keep some degree of backwards compatibility you may turn
            this off to get the old behavior that result sets are
            returned as lists of lists. However do not use this in
            new code as it is considered a deprecated feature that
            eventually will disappear.</p>

          <p>The odbc implementation now mostly uses sockets to
            communicate between the c and the erlang process, this is
            to avoid a lot of problems arising from different
            odbc-drivers doing strange things that disturbed the
            port-program communication mechanism.</p>
