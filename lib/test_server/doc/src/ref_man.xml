    <p><em>Test Server</em> is a portable test server for
      automated application testing. The server can run test suites
      and log progress and results to HTML
      pages. The main purpose of Test Server is to act as engine
      inside customized test tools. A callback interface for 
      such framework applications is provided.</p>
