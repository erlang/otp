    <title>TEST SUITE SUPPORT FUNCTIONS</title>
    <p>The following functions are supposed to be used inside a test
      suite.
      </p>
  </section>
  <funcs>
    <func>
      <name>os_type() -> OSType</name>
      <fsummary>Returns the OS type of the target node</fsummary>
      <type>
        <v>OSType = term()</v>
        <d>This is the same as returned from <c>os:type/0</c></d>
      </type>
      <desc>
        <p>This function can be called on controller or target node, and
          it will always return the OS type of the target node.</p>
      </desc>
    </func>
    <func>
      <name>fail()</name>
      <name>fail(Reason)</name>
      <fsummary>Makes the test case fail.</fsummary>
      <type>
        <v>Reason = term()</v>
        <d>The reason why the test case failed.</d>
      </type>
      <desc>
        <p>This will make the test suite fail with a given reason, or
          with <c>suite_failed</c> if no reason was given. Use this
          function if you want to terminate a test case, as this will
          make it easier to read the log- and HTML files. <c>Reason</c>
          will appear in the comment field in the HTML log.</p>
      </desc>
    </func>
    <func>
      <name>timetrap(Timout) -> Handle</name>
      <fsummary></fsummary>
      <type>
        <v>Timeout = integer() | {hours,H} | {minutes,M} | {seconds,S}</v>
        <v>H = M = S = integer()</v>
        <v>Pid = pid()</v>
        <d>The process that is to be timetrapped (<c>self()</c>by default)</d>
      </type>
      <desc>
        <p>Sets up a time trap for the current process. An expired
          timetrap kills the process with reason
          <c>timetrap_timeout</c>. The returned handle is to be given
          as argument to <c>timetrap_cancel</c> before the timetrap
          expires.  If <c>Timeout</c> is an integer, it is expected to
          be milliseconds.</p>
        <note>
          <p>If the current process is trapping exits, it will not be killed
            by the exit signal with reason <c>timetrap_timeout</c>.
            If this happens, the process will be sent an exit signal
            with reason <c>kill</c> 10 seconds later which will kill the
            process. Information about the timetrap timeout will in
            this case not be found in the test logs. However, the
            error_logger will be sent a warning.</p>
        </note>
      </desc>
    </func>
    <func>
      <name>timetrap_cancel(Handle) -> ok</name>
      <fsummary>Cancels a timetrap.</fsummary>
      <type>
        <v>Handle = term()</v>
        <d>Handle returned from <c>timetrap</c></d>
      </type>
      <desc>
        <p>This function cancels a timetrap. This must be done before
          the timetrap expires.</p>
      </desc>
    </func>
    <func>
      <name>timetrap_scale_factor() -> ScaleFactor</name>
      <fsummary>Returns the scale factor for timeouts.</fsummary>
      <type>
        <v>ScaleFactor = integer()</v>
      </type>
      <desc>
        <p>This function returns the scale factor by which all timetraps
	are scaled. It is normally 1, but can be greater than 1 if
	the test_server is running <c>cover</c>, using a larger amount of
	scheduler threads than the amount of logical processors on the
	system, running under purify, valgrind or in a debug-compiled
	emulator. The scale factor can be used if you need to scale you
	own timeouts in test cases with same factor as the test_server
	uses.</p>
      </desc>
    </func>
    <func>
      <name>sleep(MSecs) -> ok</name>
      <fsummary>Suspens the calling task for a specified time.</fsummary>
      <type>
        <v>MSecs = integer() | float() | infinity</v>
        <d>The number of milliseconds to sleep</d>
      </type>
      <desc>
        <p>This function suspends the calling process for at least the
          supplied number of milliseconds. There are two major reasons
          why you should use this function instead of
          <c>timer:sleep</c>, the first being that the module
          <c>timer</c> may be unavailable at the time the test suite is
          run, and the second that it also accepts floating point
          numbers.</p>
      </desc>
    </func>
    <func>
      <name>adjusted_sleep(MSecs) -> ok</name>
      <fsummary>Suspens the calling task for a specified time.</fsummary>
      <type>
        <v>MSecs = integer() | float() | infinity</v>
        <d>The default number of milliseconds to sleep</d>
      </type>
      <desc>
        <p>This function suspends the calling process for at least the
          supplied number of milliseconds. The function behaves the same
	  way as <c>test_server:sleep/1</c>, only <c>MSecs</c>
	  will be multiplied by the 'multiply_timetraps' value, if set,
	  and also automatically scaled up if 'scale_timetraps' is set
	  to true (which it is by default).</p>
      </desc>
    </func>
    <func>
      <name>hours(N) -> MSecs</name>
      <name>minutes(N) -> MSecs</name>
      <name>seconds(N) -> MSecs</name>
      <fsummary></fsummary>
      <type>
        <v>N = integer()</v>
        <d>Value to convert to milliseconds.</d>
      </type>
      <desc>
        <p>Theese functions convert <c>N</c> number of hours, minutes
          or seconds into milliseconds.
          </p>
        <p>Use this function when you want to
          <c>test_server:sleep/1</c> for a number of seconds, minutes or
          hours(!).</p>
      </desc>
    </func>
    <func>
      <name>format(Format) -> ok</name>
      <name>format(Format, Args)</name>
      <name>format(Pri,Format)</name>
      <name>format(Pri, Format, Args)</name>
      <fsummary></fsummary>
      <type>
        <v>Format = string()</v>
        <d>Format as described for <c>io_:format</c>.</d>
        <v>Args = list()</v>
        <d>List of arguments to format.</d>
      </type>
      <desc>
        <p>Formats output just like <c>io:format</c> but sends the
          formatted string to a logfile. If the urgency value,
          <c>Pri</c>, is lower than some threshold value, it will also
          be written to the test person's console. Default urgency is
          50, default threshold for display on the console is 1.
          </p>
        <p>Typically, the test person don't want to see everything a
          test suite outputs, but is merely interested in if the test
          cases succeeded or not, which the test server tells him. If he
          would like to see more, he could manually change the threshold
          values by using the <c>test_server_ctrl:set_levels/3</c>
          function.</p>

    </func>
    <func>
      <name>capture_start() -> ok</name>
      <name>capture_stop() -> ok</name>
      <name>capture_get() -> list()</name>
      <fsummary>Captures all output to stdout for a process.</fsummary>
      <desc>
        <p>These functions makes it possible to capture all output to
          stdout from a process started by the test suite. The list of
          characters captured can be purged by using <c>capture_get</c>.</p>
      </desc>

      <name>messages_get() -> list()</name>
      <fsummary>Empty the message queue.</fsummary>

        <p>This function will empty and return all the messages
          currently in the calling process' message queue.</p>

    <func>
      <name>timecall(M, F, A) -> {Time, Value}</name>
      <fsummary>Measures the time needed to call a function.</fsummary>
      <type>
        <v>M = atom()</v>
        <d>The name of the module where the function resides.</d>

        <d>Value returned from the called function.</d>
      </type>
      <desc>
        <p>This function measures the time (in seconds) it takes to
          call a certain function. The function call is <em>not</em>
          caught within a catch.</p>
      </desc>
    </func>
    <func>
      <name>do_times(N, M, F, A) -> ok</name>
      <name>do_times(N, Fun)</name>
      <fsummary>Calls MFA or Fun N times.</fsummary>

        <d>Arguments to M:F.</d>
      </type>
      <desc>
        <p>Calls MFA or Fun N times. Useful for extensive testing of a
          sensitive function.</p>
      </desc>
    </func>
    <func>
      <name>m_out_of_n(M, N, Fun) -> ok | exit({m_out_of_n_failed, {R,left_to_do}}</name>
      <fsummary>Fault tolerant <c>do_times</c>.</fsummary>
      <type>
        <v>N = integer()</v>
        <d>Number of times to call the Fun.</d>
        <v>M = integer()</v>
        <d>Number of times to require a successful return.</d>
      </type>
      <desc>
        <p>Repeatedly evaluates the given function until it succeeds
          (doesn't crash) M times. If, after N times, M successful
          attempts have not been accomplished, the process crashes with

          how many cases that was still to be successfully completed.
          </p>
        <p>For example:
          </p>
        <p><c>m_out_of_n(1,4,fun() -> tricky_test_case() end)</c>          <br></br>
Tries to run tricky_test_case() up to 4 times, and is

        <p><c>m_out_of_n(7,8,fun() -> clock_sanity_check() end)</c>          <br></br>
Tries running clock_sanity_check() up to 8 times,and
          allows the function to fail once.  This might be useful if
          clock_sanity_check/0 is known to fail if the clock crosses an
          hour boundary during the test (and the up to 8 test runs could
          never cross 2 boundaries)</p>

        <p><c>Comment</c> is a string which will be written in
          the shell, e.g. explaining what to do.</p>
        <p>This function will cancel all timetraps and pause the
          execution of the test case until the user executes the
          <c>continue/0</c> function. It gives the user the opportunity
          to interact with the erlang node running the tests, e.g. for
          debugging purposes or for manually executing a part of the
          test case.</p>

        <p>The user can now interact with the erlang node, and when

      <desc>
        <p><c>Fun</c> is executed in a process on a temporarily created
          hidden node with a proxy for communication with the test server
          node. The node is called a shielded node (should have been called
          a shield node). If <c>Fun</c> is successfully executed, the result
          is returned. A peer node (see <c>start_node/3</c>) started from
          the shielded node will be shielded from test server node, i.e.
          they will not be aware of each other. This is useful when you want
          to start nodes from earlier OTP releases than the OTP release of
          the test server node.</p>
        <p>Nodes from an earlier OTP release can normally not be started
          if the test server hasn't been started in compatibility mode
          (see the <c>+R</c> flag in the <c>erl(1)</c> documentation) of
          an earlier release. If a shielded node is started in compatibility
          mode of an earlier OTP release than the OTP release of the test
          server node, the shielded node can start nodes of an earlier OTP
          release.</p>
        <note>
          <p>You <em>must</em> make sure that nodes started by the shielded
            node never communicate directly with the test server node.</p>
        </note>
        <note>
          <p>Slave nodes always communicate with the test server node;
            therefore, <em>never</em> start <em>slave nodes</em> from the

          <item>Use an Erlang emulator determined by ReleaseList when

           'this'. Rel is either the name of a release, e.g., "r12b_patched"
           or 'latest'. 'this' means using the same emulator as the test
           server. Prog is the name of an emulator executable.  If the
           list has more than one element, one of them is picked
           randomly.  (Only works on Solaris and Linux, and the test server 
           gives warnings when it notices that nodes are not of the same
           version as itself.)

        <p>The <em>execution clause</em> (argument <c>Config</c>) is

          The execution clause is the real test case. Here you must call

  <section>
    <title>TEST SUITE LINE NUMBERS</title>
    <p>If a test case fails, the test server can report the exact line
      number at which it failed. There are two ways of doing this,
      either by using the <c>line</c> macro or by using the
      <c>test_server_line</c> parse transform.
      </p>
    <p>The <c>line</c> macro is described under TEST SUITE SUPPORT
      MACROS below. The <c>line</c> macro will only report the last line
      executed when a test case failed.
      </p>
    <p>The <c>test_server_line</c> parse transform is activated by
      including the headerfile <c>test_server_line.hrl</c> in the test
      suite. When doing this, it is important that the
      <c>test_server_line</c> module is in the code path of the erlang
      node compiling the test suite. The parse transform will report a
      history of a maximum of 10 lines when a test case
      fails. Consecutive lines in the same function are not shown.
      </p>
    <p>The attribute <c>-no_lines(FuncList).</c> can be used in the
      test suite to exclude specific functions from the parse
      transform. This is necessary e.g. for functions that are executed
      on old (i.e. &lt;R10B) OTP releases. <c>FuncList = [{Func,Arity}]</c>.
      </p>
    <p>If both the <c>line</c> macro and the parse transform is used in
      the same module, the parse transform will overrule the macro.
      </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>TEST SUITE SUPPORT MACROS</title>
    <p>There are some macros defined in the <c>test_server.hrl</c>
      that are quite useful for test suite programmers:
      </p>
    <p>The <em>line</em> macro, is quite
      essential when writing test cases. It tells the test server
      exactly what line of code that is being executed, so that it can
      report this line back if the test case fails. Use this macro at
      the beginning of every test case line of code.
      </p>
    <p>The <em>config</em> macro, is used to
      retrieve information from the <c>Config</c> variable sent to all
      test cases. It is used with two arguments, where the first is the
      name of the configuration variable you wish to retrieve, and the
      second is the <c>Config</c> variable supplied to the test case
      from the test server.
      </p>
    <p>Possible configuration variables include:</p>
    <list type="bulleted">
      <item><c>data_dir</c>  - Data file directory.</item>
      <item><c>priv_dir</c>  - Scratch file directory.</item>
      <item><c>nodes</c>     - Nodes specified in the spec file</item>
      <item><c>nodenames</c> - Generated nodenames.</item>
      <item>Whatever added by conf test cases or
      <c>init_per_testcase/2</c></item>
    </list>
    <p>Examples of the <c>line</c> and <c>config</c> macros can be
      seen in the Examples chapter in the user's guide.
      </p>
    <p>If the <c>line_trace</c> macro is defined, you will get a
      timestamp (<c>erlang:now()</c>) in your minor log for each
      <c>line</c> macro in your suite. This way you can at any time see
      which line is currently being executed, and when the line was
      called.
      </p>
    <p>The <c>line_trace</c> macro can also be used together with the
      <c>test_server_line</c> parse transform described above. A
      timestamp will then be written for each line in the suite, except
      for functions stated in the <c>-no_lines</c> attribute.
      </p>
    <p>The <c>line_trace</c> macro can e.g. be defined as a compile
      option, like this:
            <br></br>
<c>erlc -W -Dline_trace my_SUITE.erl</c></p>
