    <title>Using the test server controller</title>
    <p>The test server controller provides a low level interface to
      all the Test Server functionality. It is possible to use this
      interface directly, but it is recommended to use a framework
      such as <em>Common Test</em> instead. If no existing framework
      suits your needs, you could of course build your own 
      on top of the test server controller. Some information about how 
      to do this can be found in the section named "Writing you own 
      test server framework" in the Test Server User's Guide.
      </p>
    <p>For information about using the controller directly, please see 
      all available functions in the reference manual for
      <c>test_server_ctrl</c>.
