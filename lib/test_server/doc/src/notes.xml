	    If the init_per_testcase/2 function fails, the test case
	    now gets marked and counted as auto skipped, not user
	    skipped (which would previously happen).</p>

          <p>
	    When running a suite starting with a test case group,

	    Errors in coverage data collection and analysis were
	    difficult to detect. The logging has been improved so
	    that more information about e.g. imported and missing
	    modules is printed to the html log files.</p>

	    The Common Test HTML overview pages have been improved.
	    It is now possible to see if a test case has been skipped
	    explicitly or because a configuration function has
	    failed. Also, the history page (all_runs.html) now has
	    scrolling text displaying the test names. The old format
	    (showing names as a truncated string) can still be
	    generated by means of the flag/option 'basic_html'.</p>

	    The conf case in Test Server has been extended with
	    properties that make it possible to execute test cases in
	    parallel, in sequence and in shuffled order. It is now
	    also possible to repeat test cases according to different
	    criterias. The properties can be combined, making it
	    possible to e.g. repeat a conf case a certain number of
	    times and execute the test cases in different (random)
	    order every time. The properties are specified in a list
	    in the conf case definition: {conf, Properties, InitCase,
	    TestCases, EndCase}. The available properties are:
	    parallel, sequence, shuffle, repeat, repeat_until_all_ok,
	    repeat_until_any_ok, repeat_until_any_fail,
	    repeat_until_all_fail.</p>

	    The Erlang mode for Emacs has been updated with new and
	    modified skeletons for Common Test and TS. Syntax for
	    test case groups in Common Test (and conf cases with
	    properties in TS) has been added and a new minimal Common
	    Test suite skeleton has been introduced.</p>

            The step functionality in Common Test (based on
            interaction with Debugger) was broken. This has been
            fixed, and some new step features have also been added.
            Please see the Common Test User's Guide for details.</p>

	    When a testcase terminated due to a timetrap, io sent to
	    the group leader from framework:end_tc/3 (using
	    ct:pal/2/3 or ct:log/2/3) would cause deadlock. This has
	    been fixed.</p>

	    Test Server is a portable test server for automated
	    application testing. The server can run test suites on
	    local or remote targets and log progress and results to
	    HTML pages. The main purpose of Test Server is to act as
	    engine inside customized test tools. A callback interface
	    for such framework applications is provided.</p>
