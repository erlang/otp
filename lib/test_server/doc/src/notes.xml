	    Returning {return_group_result,failed} from end_per_group
	    in a group that is part of a sequence, did not cause the
	    proceeding cases (or groups) to get skipped. This has
	    been fixed.</p>

	    Common Test has been updated to handle start options and
	    test specification terms for test case groups (and test
	    cases in groups). Also, an option named 'label', has been
	    added that associates the test run with a name that
	    Common Test prints in the overview HTML logs.</p>

	    It is now possible to skip all tests in a suite, or a
	    group, by returning {fail,Reason} from the end_tc/5
	    framework function for init_per_suite, or init_per_group.</p>

          <p>
	    It is now possible for the Test Server framework end_tc
	    function to change the status of the test case from ok or
	    auto-skipped to failed by returning {fail,Reason}.</p>

	    Test Server will now call the end_per_testcase/2 function
	    even if the test case has been terminated explicitly
	    (with abort_current_testcase/1), or after a timetrap
	    timeout. Under these circumstances the return value of
	    end_per_testcase is completely ignored. Therefore the
	    function will not be able to change the reason for test
	    case termination by returning {fail,Reason}, nor will it
	    be able to save data with {save_config,Data}.</p>

	    Previously, a repeat property of a test case group
	    specified the number of times the group should be
	    repeated after the main test run. I.e. {repeat,N} would
	    case the group to execute 1+N times. To be consistent
	    with the behaviour of the run_test repeat option, this
	    has been changed. N now specifies the absolute number of
	    executions instead.</p>

	    The tc_status value in the Config list for a test case
	    that has failed because of a timetrap timeout, has

	    <p>The documentation is now possible to build in an open
	    source environment after a number of bugs are fixed and
	    some features are added in the documentation build
	    process. </p>
	    <p>- The arity calculation is updated.</p>
	    <p>- The module prefix used in the function names for
	    bif's are removed in the generated links so the links
	    will look like
	    "http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#append_element-2"
	    instead of
	    "http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#erlang:append_element-2".</p>
	    <p>- Enhanced the menu positioning in the html
	    documentation when a new page is loaded.</p>
	    <p>- A number of corrections in the generation of man
	    pages (thanks to Sergei Golovan)</p>
	    <p>- The legal notice is taken from the xml book file so
	    OTP's build process can be used for non OTP
	    applications.</p>

	    explicitly or because a configuration function has
	    failed. Also, the history page (all_runs.html) now has
	    scrolling text displaying the test names. The old format
	    (showing names as a truncated string) can still be
	    generated by means of the flag/option 'basic_html'.</p>

	    The conf case in Test Server has been extended with
	    properties that make it possible to execute test cases in
	    parallel, in sequence and in shuffled order. It is now
	    also possible to repeat test cases according to different
	    criterias. The properties can be combined, making it
	    possible to e.g. repeat a conf case a certain number of
	    times and execute the test cases in different (random)
	    order every time. The properties are specified in a list
	    in the conf case definition: {conf, Properties, InitCase,
	    TestCases, EndCase}. The available properties are:
	    parallel, sequence, shuffle, repeat, repeat_until_all_ok,
	    repeat_until_any_ok, repeat_until_any_fail,
	    repeat_until_all_fail.</p>

	    Test suite skeleton has been introduced.</p>

	    Test Server is a portable test server for automated
	    application testing. The server can run test suites on
	    local or remote targets and log progress and results to
	    HTML pages. The main purpose of Test Server is to act as
	    engine inside customized test tools. A callback interface
	    for such framework applications is provided.</p>
