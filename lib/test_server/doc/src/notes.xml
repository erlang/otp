	    When generating Makefile from Makefile.src,
	    ts_lib:get_arg/4 earlier removed all spaces in the
	    extracted argument. The code was probably meant for
	    removing leading and trailing spaces only, and is now
	    corrected to do so.</p>

	    With the Common Test 'create_priv_dir' start option set
	    to 'auto_per_tc', the name of the priv directory for a
	    configuration function could clash with the name of the
	    priv directory for a test case, which would cause Test
	    Server failure. This error has been corrected.</p>

	    The status of an aborted test due to test suite
	    compilation error has changed from 'auto_skipped' to
	    'failed'. This affects both the textual log file, event
	    handling and CT hook callbacks. The logging of
	    compilation failures has also been improved, especially
	    in the case of multiple test suites failing compilation.</p>

	    When running OTP tests using the ts interface, it is now
	    possible to specify so called test categories per OTP
	    application. A test category is represented by a CT test
	    specification and defines an arbitrary subset of existing
	    test suites, groups and cases. Examples of test
	    categories are 'smoke' (smoke tests) and 'bench'
	    (benchmarks). (Call ts:help() for more info). Also,
	    functions for reading terms from the current test
	    specification during test, ct:get_testspec_terms/0 and
	    ct:get_testspec_terms/1, have been implemented.</p>

	    If the last expression in a test case causes a timetrap
	    timeout, the stack trace is ignored and not printed to
	    the test case log file. This happens because the
	    {Suite,TestCase,Line} info is not available in the stack
	    trace in this scenario, due to tail call elimination.
	    Common Test has been modified to handle this situation by
	    inserting a {Suite,TestCase,last_expr} tuple in the
	    correct place and printing the stack trace as expected.</p>

	    Printouts by means of ct:log/2/3 or ct:pal/2/3 from the
	    hook functions on_tc_fail/2 and on_tc_skip/2 would (quite
	    unexpectedly) end up in the "unexpected i/o" log file
	    instead of in the test case log file. This behaviour has
	    been changed so that now, all printouts (including stdio
	    printouts) from these hook functions will be routed to
	    the test case log file.</p>

	    The source code to html code generator in Test Server
	    (and Common Test) would fail to generate anchors in the

	    resulting in bad html links to such functions. This

	    can't be expanded (i.e. not pre-process them), so that
	    correct anchors will always be produced.</p>

	    The mechanism for running code cover analysis with
	    common_test has been improved. Earlier, if a test run
	    consisted of multiple tests, cover would be started and
	    stopped for each test. This would give "intermediate"
	    cover logs available from the "Coverage log" link on the
	    test suite result pages. To accumulate cover data over
	    all tests, the 'export' option had to be used in the
	    cover spec file. This was not well documented, and the
	    functionality was quite confusing.</p>
          <p>
	    Using the 'nodes' option in the cover spec file would
	    fail when the test run consisted of multiple tests, since
	    the specified nodes would only be included in the cover
	    analysis of the first test.</p>
          <p>
	    The repeated compilation and analysis of the same modules
	    was also very time consuming.</p>
          <p>
	    To overcome these problems, ct will now only cover
	    compile and analyze modules once per test run, i.e. once
	    for each cover spec file. The log file is available via a
	    new button on the top level index page. The old "Coverage
	    log" links on the test suite result pages still exist,
	    but they all point to the same log containing the
	    accumulated result.</p>

	    <p>The way Common Test handles skipping of test cases has
	    been updated. In previous versions, returning
	    <c>{skip,Reason}</c> from a configuration function (such
	    as init_per_suite or init_per_group), resulted in all
	    affected test cases getting skipped with status
	    <c>auto_skipped</c>. This was inappropriate, since this
	    status is supposed to be used to inform that Common Test
	    has taken the initiative to skip something (e.g. a test
	    case group if init_per_group failed). Therefore, in this
	    version of Common Test, whenever the user skips a suite,
	    group, or individual test case (by means of a
	    configuration function or test specification term), the
	    affected test cases get the status <c>user_skipped</c>
	    instead.</p> <p>This update has meant a few changes that
	    may affect Common Test users in various ways:</p> <list>
	    <item>The test results and statistics will be affected,
	    which is important to know when running regression tests
	    and comparing results to previous test runs.</item>
	    <item>Users that read or parse the textual log file
	    <c>suite.log</c> will notice that an auto skipped
	    function is now reported as <c>auto_skipped</c> rather
	    than <c>skipped</c> as before.</item> <item>When
	    <c>require</c> fails in an info function (such as suite/0
	    or group/1), all affected configuration functions and
	    test cases are marked as <c>auto_skipped</c>.</item>
	    <item>If Common Test detects an error in the test suite
	    (such as e.g. an invalid all/0 function), all affected
	    configuration functions and test cases are marked as
	    <c>auto_skipped</c>.</item> <item>If a repeated test run
	    session reaches a deadline with <c>force_stop</c>
	    enabled, all remaining test cases are marked as
	    <c>auto_skipped</c> rather than <c>user_skipped</c> as
	    before.</item> <item>The event messages that Common Test
	    generates during test runs have been affected by this
	    update. For details see OTP-11524.</item> </list>

	    case to stdout whenever it received an error- or progress

	    and ct:pal/2, before and after a test run. (Some minor

	    Test Framework Log page. The Common Test User's Guide has

	    The unicode update of test_server for R16A introduced a
	    few potential errors when logging to files. Sometimes ~tp
	    or ~ts was used for formatting also when writing to files
	    that were not opened with the {encoding,utf8} option. If
	    then the argument contained unicode characters above 255,
	    the file descriptor would crash. This has been corrected
	    by the following modifications:</p> <list> <item> Since the
	    'unexpected_io' log file is used only when the test case
	    HTML file is not available (e.g. between test cases),
	    this file is now also a HTML file and as other
	    test_server HTML logs it is always UTF-8 encoded </item>
	    <item> Since it is possible to change which information
	    is going to which log file (with
	    test_server_ctrl:set_levels/3), we do not have full
	    control over which information is written to which file.
	    This means that any printout could be written to the
	    'major' log file (suite.log), which was earlier encoded
	    as latin1. To avoid crashing this file descriptor due to
	    unicode strings, the 'major' log file is now also encoded
	    in UTF-8 (possible incopatibility). </item> <item> The
	    cross_cover.info file is no longer a text file which can
	    be read with file:consult/1, instead it is written as a
	    pure binary file using term_to_binary when writing and
	    binary_to_term when reading. </item> <item> The encoding
	    of the file named 'last_name', which only content is the
	    path to the last run.&lt;timestamp&gt; directory, is now
	    dependent on the file name mode of the VM. If file names
	    are expected to be unicode, then the 'last_name' file is
	    UTF-8 encoded, else it is latin1 encoded. </item> </list>
          <p>
	    Also, ~tp has been changed back to ~p unless it is
	    somehow likely that the argument includes strings. It is
	    not obvious that this is the correct thing to do, but
	    some decission had to be taken...</p>

	    <p>In test_server, the same process would supervise the
	    currently running test case and be group leader (and IO
	    server) for the test case. Furthermore, when running
	    parallel test cases, new temporary supervisor/group
	    leader processes were spawned and the process that was
	    group leader for sequential test cases would not be
	    active. That would lead to several problems:</p>
	    <p>* Processes started by init_per_suite will inherit the
	    group leader of the init_per_suite process (and that
	    group leader would not process IO requests when parallel
	    test cases was running). If later a parallel test case
	    caused such a processto print using (for example)
	    io:format/2, the calling would hang.</p>
	    <p>* Similarly, if a process was spawned from a parallel
	    test case, it would inherit the temporary group leader
	    for that parallel test case. If that spawned process
	    later - when the group of parallel tests have finished -
	    attempted to print something, its group leader would be
	    dead and there would be <c>badarg</c> exception.</p>
	    <p>Those problems have been solved by having group
	    leaders separate from the processes that supervises the
	    test cases, and keeping temporary group leader process
	    for parallel test cases alive until no more process in
	    the system use them as group leaders.</p>
	    <p>Also, a new <c>unexpected_io.log</c> log file
	    (reachable from the summary page of each test suite) has
	    been introduced. All unexpected IO will be printed into
	    it(for example, IO to a group leader for a parallel test
	    case that has finished).</p>

	    possible to modify some aspects of the logging behaviour
	    in Common Test (or Test Server). For example, if the html
	    version of the test suite source code should not be
	    generated during the test run (and consequently be
	    unavailable in the log file system), the feature may be
	    disabled by means of "ct_run ... -logopts no_src" (or
	    ct:run_test([..., {logopts,[no_src]}])). A new framework
	    callback function, get_logopts/0, has been introduced

	    When running tests with auto-compilation disabled, Common
	    Test could only display the test suite source code on
	    html format in the test case log if the source file was
	    located in the same directory as the pre-compiled suite.
	    This has been modified so that Common Test now tries to
	    locate the source file by means of the test suite module
	    info (Suite:module_info/1). As a result, a suite may now
	    be compiled to a different output directory (e.g.
	    $MYTEST/bin) than the source code directory (e.g.
	    $MYTEST/src), without the source-code-to-html generation
	    being affected.</p>

	    Test Server is a portable test server for automated
	    application testing. The server can run test suites on
	    local or remote targets and log progress and results to
	    HTML pages. The main purpose of Test Server is to act as
	    engine inside customized test tools. A callback interface
	    for such framework applications is provided.</p>
