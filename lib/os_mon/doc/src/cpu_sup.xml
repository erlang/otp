  <modulesummary>A CPU Load and CPU Utilization Supervisor Process</modulesummary>
  <description>
    <p><c>cpu_sup</c> is a process which supervises the CPU load
      and CPU utilization. It is part of the OS_Mon application, see
      <seealso marker="os_mon_app">os_mon(6)</seealso>. Available for Unix,
      although CPU utilization values (<c>util/0,1</c>) are only
      available for Solaris, Linux and FreeBSD.</p>
    <p>The load values are proportional to how long time a runnable
      Unix process has to spend in the run queue before it is scheduled.
      Accordingly, higher values mean more system load. The returned
      value divided by 256 produces the figure displayed by <c>rup</c>
      and <c>top</c>. What is displayed as 2.00 in <c>rup</c>, is
      displayed as load up to the second mark in <c>xload</c>.</p>
    <p>For example, <c>rup</c> displays a load of 128 as 0.50, and
      512 as 2.00.</p>
    <p>If the user wants to view load values as percentage of machine
      capacity, then this way of measuring presents a problem, because
      the load values are not restricted to a fixed interval. In this
      case, the following simple mathematical transformation can
      produce the load value as a percentage:</p>
    <code type="none">
      PercentLoad = 100 * (1 - D/(D + Load))
    </code>
    <p><c>D</c> determines which load value should be associated with
      which percentage. Choosing <c>D</c> = 50 means that 128 is 60% 
      load, 256 is 80%, 512 is 90%, and so on.</p>
    <p>Another way of measuring system load is to divide the number of
      busy CPU cycles by the total number of CPU cycles. This produces 
      values in the 0-100 range immediately. However, this method hides 
      the fact that a machine can be more or less saturated. CPU
      utilization is therefore a better name than system load for this
      measure.</p>
    <p>A server which receives just enough requests to never become
      idle will score a CPU utilization of 100%. If the server receives
      50% more requests, it will still score 100%. When the system load
      is calculated with the percentage formula shown previously,
      the load will increase from 80% to 87%.</p>
    <p>The <c>avg1/0</c>, <c>avg5/0</c>, and <c>avg15/0</c> functions
      can be used for retrieving system load values, and
      the <c>util/0</c> and <c>util/1</c> functions can be used for
      retrieving CPU utilization values.</p>
    <p>When run on Linux, <c>cpu_sup</c> assumes that the <c>/proc</c>
      file system is present and accessible by <c>cpu_sup</c>. If it is
      not, <c>cpu_sup</c> will terminate.</p>
