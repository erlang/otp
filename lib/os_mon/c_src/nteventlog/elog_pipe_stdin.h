/*
 * Module: elog_pipe_stdin
 * Purpouse: Read data from stdin when stdin is a pipe
 * and deliver events only when data is really availabel or 
 * end of file is reached.
 * If we would wait on an ordinary pipe handle, we 
 * would return immediately as it's always "signaled".
 * some kind of asynchronous I/O in the win32 way is 
 * not possible as it's not supported on anonymous pipes
 * (besides we have not opened the file ourselves so we 
 *  cannot specify that we want async I/O...).
 * ToDo: The reading is inneficcient, the buffering 
 * goes on forever, which would be dangerous if to much 
 * data was passed into stdin. The handling of 
 * Console stdin should be transparent instead of
 * forcing the user of the module to check if this is a 
 * console for selecting between ReadFile and 
 * read_pipe_stdin.
 * The handling of the event object is somewhat strange 
 * because I want to know about EOF before I've read
 * to it.
