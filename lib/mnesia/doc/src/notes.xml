  <p>This document describes the changes made to the Mnesia system
    from version to version.  The intention of this document is to
    list all incompatibilities as well as all enhancements and
    bugfixes for every release of Mnesia. Each release of Mnesia
    thus constitutes one section in this document. The title of each
    section is the version number of Mnesia.</p>

	    Added experimental external backend plugin api. This adds
	    the possibility for the user to write other storage
	    backends for data, for example by using shared memory or
	    ram-cached disk storage.</p>
          <p>
	    The plugin api may change in future versions after being
	    battle tested.</p>

          <p>
	    In case of bag tables, trying to delete a non-existing
	    object leads to the index becoming corrupt. This happens
	    if the non-existing object we try to delete happens to
	    share its key and index field value with a single
	    existing object in the table. Result: The index entry
	    corresponding to the existing object is removed.</p>
          <p>
	    Prevent index from being corrupted if a nonexistent item
	    is deleted</p>
          <p>
	    We have to ensure that we actually delete the last object
	    with a given (key, index) pair before removing the index.

	    Add {majority, boolean()} per-table option.</p>
          <p>
	    With {majority, true} set for a table, write transactions
	    will abort if they cannot commit to a majority of the
	    nodes that have a copy of the table. Currently, the
	    implementation hooks into the prepare_commit, and forces
	    an asymmetric transaction if the commit set affects any
	    table with the majority flag set. In the commit itself,
	    the transaction will abort if it cannot satisfy the
	    majority requirement for all tables involved in the
	    transaction.(Thanks to Ulf Wiger)</p>

          <p>
	    "-f" is a non-standard chmod option which at least SGI

	    "-f" flag is to suppress warning messages, it can be
	    safely omitted. (Thanks to Holger Weiß)</p>
