    <title>Combining Mnesia and SNMP </title>
    <p>Many telecommunications applications must be controlled and
      reconfigured remotely. It is sometimes an advantage to perform
      this remote control with an open protocol such as the Simple
      Network Management Protocol (SNMP). The alternatives to this would
      be:  
      </p>
    <list type="bulleted">
      <item>Not being able to control the application remotely at all.
      </item>
      <item>Using a proprietary control protocol.
      </item>
      <item>Using a bridge which maps control messages in a
       proprietary protocol to a standardized management protocol and
       vice versa. 
      </item>
    </list>
    <p>All of these approaches have different advantages and
      disadvantages. Mnesia applications can easily be opened to the
      SNMP protocol. It is possible to establish a direct one-to-one
      mapping between Mnesia tables and SNMP tables. This
      means that a Mnesia table can be configured to be <em>both</em>
      a Mnesia table and an SNMP table. A number of functions to
      control this behavior are described in the Mnesia reference
      manual.
