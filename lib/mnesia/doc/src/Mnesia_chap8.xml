    <title>Combine Mnesia and SNMP</title>
    <p>Many telecommunications applications must be controlled and
      reconfigured remotely. It is sometimes an advantage to perform
      this remote control with an open protocol such as the Simple
      Network Management Protocol (SNMP). The alternatives to this would
      be the following:</p>
    <list type="bulleted">
      <item>Not being able to control the application remotely
      </item>
      <item>Using a proprietary control protocol
      </item>
      <item>Using a bridge that maps control messages in a
       proprietary protocol to a standardized management protocol and
       conversely
      </item>
    </list>
    <p>All these approaches have different advantages and
      disadvantages. <c>Mnesia</c> applications can easily be opened to
      the SNMP protocol. A direct 1-to-1 mapping can be established
      between <c>Mnesia</c> tables and SNMP tables. This means
      that a <c>Mnesia</c> table can be configured to be <em>both</em>
      a <c>Mnesia</c> table and an SNMP table. A number of functions to
      control this behavior are described in the Reference Manual.</p>
