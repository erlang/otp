  <modulesummary>A Distributed Telecommunications DBMS </modulesummary>
  <description>
    <p><c>Mnesia</c> is a distributed DataBase Management System (DBMS),
      appropriate for telecommunications applications and other Erlang
      applications which require continuous operation and  exhibit soft
      real-time properties.
      </p>
    <p>Listed below are some of the most important and attractive capabilities, Mnesia provides:
      </p>
    <list type="bulleted">
      <item>
        <p>A relational/object hybrid data model which is
          suitable for telecommunications applications.
          </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>A specifically designed  DBMS query language, QLC (as an add-on library). 
          </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>Persistence. Tables may be coherently kept on disc as
          well as in main memory.
          </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>Replication. Tables may be replicated at several nodes.
          </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>Atomic transactions. A series of table manipulation
          operations can be grouped into a single atomic
          transaction.
          </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>Location transparency. Programs can be written without
          knowledge of the actual location of data.
          </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>Extremely fast real time data searches.
          </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>Schema manipulation routines. It is possible to
          reconfigure the DBMS at runtime without stopping the
          system.
          </p>
      </item>
    </list>
    <p>This Reference Manual describes the Mnesia API. This includes
      functions used to define and manipulate Mnesia tables.
      </p>
    <p>All functions documented in these pages can be used in any
      combination with queries using the list comprehension notation. The
      query notation is described in the QLC's man page.
      </p>
    <p>Data in Mnesia is organized as a set of tables.  Each table
      has a name which must be an atom. Each table is made up of
      Erlang records.  The user is responsible for the record
      definitions.  Each table also has a set of properties. Below
      are some of the properties that are associated with each
      table:
      </p>
    <list type="bulleted">
      <item>
        <p><c>type</c>. Each table can either have 'set',
          'ordered_set' or 'bag' semantics. Note: currently 'ordered_set' 
          is not supported for 'disc_only_copies'. If a table is of type
          'set' it means that each key leads to either one or zero
          records.           <br></br>
If a new item is inserted with the same key as
          an existing record, the old record is overwritten. On the
          other hand, if a table is of type 'bag', each key can map to
          several records. However, all records in type bag tables are
          unique, only the keys may be duplicated.
          </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>record_name</c>. All records stored in a table must
          have the same name. You may say that the records must be
          instances of the same record type.
          </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>ram_copies</c> A table can be replicated on a number
          of Erlang nodes. The <c>ram_copies</c> property specifies a
          list of Erlang nodes where RAM copies are kept.  These
          copies can be dumped to disc at regular intervals.  However,
          updates to these copies are not written to disc on a
          transaction basis.
          </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>disc_copies</c> The <c>disc_copies</c> property
          specifies a list of Erlang nodes where the table is kept in
          RAM as well as on disc. All updates of the table are
          performed on the actual table and are also logged to disc.
          If a table is of type <c>disc_copies</c> at a certain node,
          it means that the entire table is resident in RAM memory as
          well as on disc. Each transaction performed on the table is
          appended to a LOG file as well as written into the RAM
          table.
          </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>disc_only_copies</c> Some, or all, table replicas
          can be kept on disc only. These replicas are considerably
          slower than the RAM based replicas.
          </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>index</c> This is a list of attribute names, or
          integers, which specify the tuple positions on which
          Mnesia shall build and maintain an extra index table.
          </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>local_content</c> When an application requires 
          tables whose contents is local to each node,
          <c>local_content</c> tables may be used. The name of the
          table is known to all Mnesia nodes, but its contents is
          unique on each node. This means that access to such a table
          must be done locally.  Set the <c>local_content</c> field to
          <c>true</c> if you want to enable the <c>local_content</c>
          behavior. The default is <c>false</c>.
          </p>
      </item>
      <item>
	<p><c>majority</c> This attribute can be either <c>true</c> or
	<c>false</c> (default is <c>false</c>). When <c>true</c>, a majority
	of the table replicas must be available for an update to succeed.
	Majority checking can be enabled on tables with mission-critical data,
	where it is vital to avoid inconsistencies due to network splits.
	</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>snmp</c> Each (set based) Mnesia table can be
          automatically turned into an SNMP ordered table as well.
          This property specifies the types of the SNMP keys.
          </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>attributes</c>. The names of the attributes for the
          records that are inserted in the table.
          </p>
      </item>
    </list>
    <p>See <c>mnesia:create_table/2</c> about the complete set of
      table properties and their details.
      </p>
    <p>This document uses a table of persons to illustrate various
      examples. The following record definition is assumed:
      </p>
    <code type="none">
-record(person, {name,
                 age = 0,
                 address = unknown,
                 salary = 0,
                 children = []}),
    </code>
    <p>The first attribute of the record is the primary key, or key
      for short.
      </p>
    <p>The function descriptions are sorted in alphabetic order. <em>Hint:</em>
      start to read about <c>mnesia:create_table/2</c>,
      <c>mnesia:lock/2</c> and <c>mnesia:activity/4</c> before you continue on
      and learn about the rest.
      </p>
    <p>Writing or deleting in transaction context creates a local copy
      of each modified record during the transaction. During iteration,
      i.e. <c>mnesia:fold[lr]/4</c> <c>mnesia:next/2</c> <c>mnesia:prev/2</c> 
      <c>mnesia:snmp_get_next_index/2</c>, mnesia will compensate for 
      every written or deleted record, which may reduce the
      performance. If possible avoid writing or deleting records in
      the same transaction before iterating over the table.
    </p>

  <funcs>
    <func>
      <name>abort(Reason) -> transaction abort </name>

      <desc>
        <p>Makes the transaction silently 
          return the tuple <c>{aborted, Reason}</c>.
          The abortion of a Mnesia transaction means that
          an exception will be thrown to an enclosing <c>catch</c>.
          Thus, the expression <c>catch mnesia:abort(x)</c> does
          not abort the transaction. </p>
      </desc>
    </func>
    <func>
      <name>activate_checkpoint(Args) -> {ok,Name,Nodes} | {error,Reason}</name>
      <fsummary>Activate a checkpoint.</fsummary>
      <desc>
        <p>A checkpoint is a consistent view of the system. 
          A checkpoint can be activated on a set of tables.
          This checkpoint can then be traversed and will
          present a view of the system as it existed at the time when
          the checkpoint was activated,  even if the tables are being or have been
          manipulated. 
          </p>
        <p><c>Args</c> is a list of the following tuples: 
          </p>
        <list type="bulleted">
          <item>
            <p><c>{name,Name}</c>. <c>Name</c> of checkpoint. Each
              checkpoint must have a name which is unique to the
              associated nodes. The name can be reused only once the
              checkpoint has been deactivated. By default, a name
              which is probably unique is generated.
              </p>
          </item>
          <item>
            <p><c>{max,MaxTabs}</c>. <c>MaxTabs</c> is a list of
              tables that should be included in the checkpoint. The
              default is []. For these tables, the redundancy will be
              maximized and checkpoint information will be retained together
              with all replicas. The checkpoint becomes more fault
              tolerant if the tables have several replicas. When a new
              replica is added by means of the schema manipulation
              function <c>mnesia:add_table_copy/3</c>, a retainer will 
              also be attached automatically.
              </p>
          </item>
          <item>
            <p><c>{min,MinTabs}</c>. <c>MinTabs</c> is a list of
              tables that should be included in the checkpoint. The
              default is []. For these tables, the redundancy will be
              minimized and the checkpoint information will only be retained
              with one replica, preferably on the local node.
              </p>
          </item>
          <item>
            <p><c>{allow_remote,Bool}</c>. <c>false</c> means that
              all retainers must be local. The checkpoint cannot be
              activated if a table does not reside locally.
              <c>true</c> allows retainers to be allocated on any
              node. Default is set to <c>true</c>.

          </item>
          <item>
            <p><c>{ram_overrides_dump,Bool}</c>. Only applicable
              for <c>ram_copies</c>.  <c>Bool</c> allows you to choose
              to backup the table state as it is in RAM, or as it is on
              disc. <c>true</c> means that the latest committed
              records in RAM should be included in the checkpoint.
              These are the  records that the application accesses.
              <c>false</c> means that the records dumped to DAT files
              should be included in the checkpoint. These are the
              records that will be loaded at startup. Default is
              <c>false</c>.   
              </p>
          </item>
        </list>
        <p>Returns <c>{ok,Name,Nodes}</c> or <c>{error,Reason}</c>.
          <c>Name</c> is the (possibly generated) name of the
          checkpoint. <c>Nodes</c> are the nodes that
          are involved in the checkpoint. Only nodes that keep a
          checkpoint retainer know about the checkpoint.

        <p>Table indices can and should be used whenever the user
          wants to frequently use some other field than the key field
          to look up records. If this other field has an index
          associated with it, these lookups can occur in constant time
          and space.  For example, if our application wishes to use
          the age field of persons to efficiently find all person with
          a specific age, it might be a good idea to have an index on
          the age field. This can be accomplished with the following
          call:</p>
        <code type="none">
mnesia:add_table_index(person, age)

        <p>Indices do not come free, they occupy space which is

      <desc>
        <p>Call the <c>Fun</c> in a context which is not protected
          by a transaction. The Mnesia function calls performed in the
          <c>Fun</c> are mapped to the corresponding dirty
          functions. This still involves logging, replication and
          subscriptions, but there is no locking, local transaction
          storage, or commit protocols involved. Checkpoint retainers
          and indices are updated, but they will be updated dirty. As
          for normal mnesia:dirty_* operations, the operations are
          performed semi-asynchronously. See
          <c>mnesia:activity/4</c> and the Mnesia User's Guide for
          more details.
          </p>
        <p>It is possible to manipulate the Mnesia tables without
          using transactions. This has some serious disadvantages, but
          is considerably faster since the transaction manager is not
          involved and no locks are set. A dirty operation does,
          however, guarantee a certain level of consistency and it is
          not possible for the dirty operations to return garbled
          records. All dirty operations provide location transparency
          to the programmer and a program does not have to be aware of
          the whereabouts of a certain table in order to function. 
          </p>
        <p><em>Note:</em>It is more than 10 times more efficient to read records dirty
          than within a transaction.
          </p>
        <p>Depending on the application, it may be a good idea to use
          the dirty functions for certain operations. Almost all
          Mnesia functions which can be called within transactions
          have a dirty equivalent which is much more
          efficient. However, it must be noted that it is possible for
          the database to be left in an inconsistent state if dirty
          operations are used to update it. Dirty operations should
          only be used for performance reasons when it is absolutely
          necessary.  </p>
        <p><em>Note:</em> Calling (nesting) a <c>mnesia:[a]sync_dirty</c>
          inside a transaction context will inherit the transaction semantics.

        <p>The Mnesia algorithm for table load might lead to a

        <p>This function is used to install a backup as fallback.  The
          fallback will be used to restore the database at the next
          start-up. Installation of fallbacks requires Erlang to be up
          and running on all the involved nodes, but it does not
          matter if Mnesia is running or not. The installation of the
          fallback will fail if the local node is not one of the disc
          resident nodes in the backup.
          </p>
        <p><c>Args</c> is a list of the following tuples:

              module which may interpret it as it wish. The default
              callback module is called <c>mnesia_backup</c> and it
              interprets the <c>Opaque</c> argument as a local
              filename. The default for this module is also
              configurable via the <c>-mnesia mnesia_backup</c>

              for one node. By default, the installation of a fallback
              is a global operation which either is performed all
              nodes with disc resident schema or none. Which nodes
              that are disc resident or not, is determined from the
              schema info in the backup.</p>
            <p>If the <c>Scope</c> of the operation is <c>local</c>

              This argument is only valid if the scope of the
              installation is <c>local</c>. Normally the installation
              of a fallback is targeted towards the Mnesia directory
              as configured with the <c>-mnesia dir</c> configuration
              parameter. But by explicitly supplying an
              <c>AlternateDir</c> the fallback will be installed there
              regardless of the Mnesia directory configuration
              parameter setting. After installation of a fallback on
              an alternate Mnesia directory that directory is fully
              prepared for usage as an active Mnesia directory.

      <desc>
        <p>Write locks are normally acquired on all nodes where a
          replica of the table resides (and is active). Read locks are
          acquired on one node (the local node if  a local
          replica exists). Most of the context sensitive access functions
          acquire an implicit lock if they are invoked in a
          transaction context. The granularity of a lock may either
          be a single record or an entire table.
	</p>
	<p>The normal usage is to call the function without checking
	  the return value since it exits if it fails and the
	  transaction is restarted by the transaction manager.  It
	  returns all the locked nodes if a write lock is acquired, and
	  <c>ok</c> if it was a read lock.
	</p>
        <p>This function <c>mnesia:lock/2</c> is intended to support
          explicit locking on tables but also intended for situations
          when locks need to be acquired regardless of how tables are
          replicated. Currently, two <c>LockKind</c>'s are supported:
          </p>
        <taglist>
          <tag><c>write</c></tag>
          <item>
            <p>Write locks are exclusive, which means that if one
              transaction manages to acquire a write lock on an item,
              no other transaction may acquire any kind of lock on the
              same item. 
              </p>
          </item>
          <tag><c>read</c></tag>
          <item>
            <p>Read locks may be shared, which means that if one
              transaction manages to acquire a read lock on an item,
              other transactions may also acquire a read lock on the
              same item. However, if someone has a read lock no one can
              acquire a write lock at the same item. If some one has a
              write lock no one can acquire  a read lock nor
              a write lock at the same item.</p>
          </item>
        </taglist>
        <p>Conflicting lock requests are automatically queued if there
          is no risk of a deadlock. Otherwise the transaction must be
          aborted and executed again. Mnesia does this automatically
          as long as the upper limit of maximum <c>retries</c> is not
          reached. See <c>mnesia:transaction/3</c> for the details.
          </p>
        <p>For the sake of completeness sticky write locks will also 
          be described here even if a sticky write lock is not
          supported by this particular function:
          </p>
        <taglist>
          <tag><c>sticky_write</c></tag>
          <item>
            <p>Sticky write locks are a mechanism which can be used
              to optimize write lock acquisition. If your application
              uses replicated tables mainly for fault tolerance (as
              opposed to read access optimization purpose), sticky
              locks may be the best option available. 
              </p>
            <p>When a sticky write lock is acquired, all nodes will be
              informed which node is locked. Subsequently,
              sticky lock requests from the same node will be
              performed as  a local operation without any
              communication with other nodes. The sticky lock
              lingers on the node even after the transaction has
              ended. See the Mnesia User's Guide for more information.</p>

        <p>Currently, two kinds of <c>LockItem</c>'s are supported by
          this function:
          </p>
        <taglist>
          <tag><c>{table, Tab}</c></tag>
          <item>
            <p>This acquires a lock of type <c>LockKind</c> on the
              entire table <c>Tab</c>.
              </p>
          </item>
          <tag><c>{global, GlobalKey, Nodes}</c></tag>
          <item>
            <p>This acquires a lock of type <c>LockKind</c> on the
              global resource <c>GlobalKey</c>. The lock is acquired
              on all active nodes in the <c>Nodes</c> list. </p>
          </item>
        </taglist>
        <p>Locks are released when the outermost transaction ends.
          </p>
        <p>The semantics of this function is context sensitive. See
          <c>mnesia:activity/4</c> for more information. In transaction
          context it acquires locks otherwise it just ignores the
          request.</p>

      <fsummary>Match <c>Pattern</c>for records. </fsummary>
      <desc>
        <p>This function takes a pattern with 'don't care' variables
          denoted as a '_' parameter.  This function returns a list of
          records which matched the pattern.  Since the second element
          of a record in a table is considered to be the key for the
          record, the performance of this function depends on whether
          this key is bound or not. 
          </p>
        <p>For example, the call <c>mnesia:match_object(person, {person, '_', 36, '_', '_'}, read)</c> returns a list of all person records with an 
          age field of thirty-six (36).
          </p>
        <p>The function <c>mnesia:match_object/3</c>
          automatically uses indices if these exist. However, no
          heuristics are performed in order to select the best
          index.
          </p>
        <p>The semantics of this function is context sensitive. See
          <c>mnesia:activity/4</c> for more information. In transaction
          context it acquires a lock of type <c>LockKind</c> on the
          entire table or a single record. Currently, the lock type
          <c>read</c> is supported.</p>

        <p>The storage type is preserved. For example, a RAM table
          moved from one node remains a RAM on the new node.  It is
          still possible for other transactions to read and write in
          the table while it is being moved.

        <p>This function makes it possible to traverse a table

          the end of the table is reached, the special key
          <c>'$end_of_table'</c> is returned. Otherwise, the function

        <p>This function reads all records from table <c>Tab</c> with

          regardless of the location of <c>Tab</c>. If the table is
          of type <c>bag</c>, the <c>mnesia:read(Tab, Key)</c> can
          return an arbitrarily long list. If the table is of type

        <p>The semantics of this function is context sensitive. See
          <c>mnesia:activity/4</c> for more information. In transaction

          <c>write</c> and <c>sticky_write</c> are supported.
          </p>
        <p>If the user wants to update the record it is more efficient to 
          use  <c>write/sticky_write</c> as the LockKind. If majority checking
	  is active on the table, it will be checked as soon as a write lock is
	  attempted. This can be used to quickly abort if the majority condition

        <p>It is possible to establish a direct one to one mapping
          between Mnesia tables and SNMP tables. Many
          telecommunication applications are controlled and monitored
          by the SNMP protocol. This connection between Mnesia and
          SNMP makes it simple and convenient to achieve this.
          </p>
        <p>The <c>SnmpStruct</c> argument is a list of SNMP
          information. Currently, the only information needed is
          information about the key types in the table.  It is not
          possible to handle multiple keys in Mnesia, but many SNMP
          tables have multiple keys. Therefore, the following
          convention is used: if a table has multiple keys, these must
          always be stored as a tuple of the keys.  Information about
          the key types is specified as a tuple of atoms describing
          the types. The only significant type is
          <c>fix_string</c>. This means that a string has fixed
          size. For example:
          </p>
        <code type="none">
mnesia:snmp_open_table(person, [{key, string}])
        </code>
        <p>causes the <c>person</c> table to be ordered as an SNMP
          table.
          </p>
        <p>Consider the following schema for a table of company
          employees. Each employee is identified by department number
          and name. The other table column stores the telephone number:
          </p>
        <code type="none">
mnesia:create_table(employee,
    [{snmp, [{key, {integer, string}}]},
     {attributes, record_info(fields, employees)}]),
        </code>
        <p>The corresponding SNMP table would have three columns;
          <c>department</c>, <c>name</c> and <c>telno</c>.
          </p>
        <p>It is possible to have table columns that are not visible
          through the SNMP protocol. These columns must be the last
          columns of the table. In the previous example, the SNMP
          table could have columns <c>department</c> and <c>name</c>
          only. The application could then use the <c>telno</c> column
          internally, but it would not be visible to the SNMP
          managers.
          </p>
        <p>In a table monitored by SNMP, all elements must be
          integers, strings, or lists of integers.
          </p>
        <p>When a table is SNMP ordered, modifications are more
          expensive than usual, O(logN).  And more memory is used.
          </p>
        <p><em>Note:</em>Only the lexicographical SNMP ordering is
          implemented in Mnesia, not the actual SNMP monitoring.</p>

      <name>start() -> ok | {error, Reason} </name>
      <fsummary>Start a local Mnesia system.</fsummary>
      <desc>
        <p>The start-up procedure for a set of Mnesia nodes is a
          fairly complicated operation. A Mnesia system consists of a set
          of nodes, with Mnesia  started locally on all
          participating nodes. Normally, each node has a directory where
          all the Mnesia files are written. This directory will be
          referred to as the Mnesia directory. Mnesia may also be
          started on disc-less nodes. See <c>mnesia:create_schema/1</c>
          and the Mnesia User's Guide for more information about disc-less
          nodes.
          </p>
        <p>The set of nodes which makes up a Mnesia system is kept in
          a schema and it is possible to add and remove Mnesia nodes
          from the schema. The initial schema is normally created on
          disc with the function <c>mnesia:create_schema/1</c>. On
          disc-less nodes, a tiny default schema is generated each time
          Mnesia is started. During the start-up procedure, Mnesia
          will exchange schema information between the nodes in order
          to verify that the table definitions are compatible.
          </p>
        <p>Each schema has a unique cookie which may be regarded as a
          unique schema identifier. The cookie must be the same on all
          nodes where Mnesia is supposed to run. See the Mnesia
          User's Guide for more information about these details.
          </p>
        <p>The schema file, as well as all other files which Mnesia
          needs, are kept in the Mnesia directory. The command line
          option <c>-mnesia dir Dir</c> can be used to specify the
          location of this directory to the Mnesia system. If no such
          command line option is found, the name of the directory
          defaults to <c>Mnesia.Node</c>.

          to QLC. The <c>lock</c> option may be <c>read</c> or
          <c>write</c>, default is <c>read</c>.  The option
          <c>n_objects</c> specifies (roughly) the number of objects
          returned from mnesia to QLC. Queries to remote tables may
          need a larger chunks to reduce network overhead, default
          <c>100</c> objects at a time are returned.  The option
          <c>traverse</c> determines the method to traverse the whole
          table (if needed), the default method is <c>select</c>:</p>
        <list type="bulleted">
          <item>
            <p><c>select</c>. The table is traversed by calling
              <c>mnesia:select/4</c> and <c>mnesia:select/1</c>. The
              match specification (the second argument of <c>select/3</c>) 
              is assembled by QLC: simple filters are
              translated into equivalent match specifications while
              more complicated filters have to be applied to all
              objects returned by <c>select/3</c> given a match
              specification that matches all objects.</p>
          </item>
          <item>

              the table is traversed by calling <c>mnesia:select/3</c> and
              <c>mnesia:select/1</c>. The difference is that the match
              specification is explicitly given. This is how to state
              match specifications that cannot easily be expressed
              within the syntax provided by QLC.</p>

        <p>This function executes the functional object <c>Fun</c>

          </p>
        <p>The code which executes inside the transaction
          can consist of a series of table manipulation functions.
          If something goes wrong inside the transaction as a result of a
          user error or a certain table not being available, the
          entire transaction is aborted and the function 
          <c>transaction/1</c> returns the tuple 
          <c>{aborted, Reason}</c>.
          </p>
        <p>If all is well, <c>{atomic, ResultOfFun}</c> is returned where
          <c>ResultOfFun</c> is the value of the last expression in
          <c>Fun</c>.
          </p>
        <p>A function which adds a family to the database can be
          written as follows if we have a structure <c>{family, Father, Mother, ChildrenList}</c>:
          </p>
        <code type="none">
add_family({family, F, M, Children}) ->
    ChildOids = lists:map(fun oid/1, Children),
    Trans = fun() ->      
        mnesia:write(F#person{children = ChildOids}, 
        mnesia:write(M#person{children = ChildOids},
        Write = fun(Child) -> mnesia:write(Child) end,
        lists:foreach(Write, Children)
    end,
    mnesia:transaction(Trans).

oid(Rec) -> {element(1, Rec), element(2, Rec)}.
        </code>
        <p>This code adds a set of people to the database. Running this code
          within one transaction will ensure that either the whole
          family is added to the database, or the  whole transaction
          aborts. For example, if the last child is badly formatted,
          or the executing process terminates due to an
          <c>'EXIT'</c> signal while executing the family code, the
          transaction aborts. Accordingly, the situation where half a
          family is added can never occur.
          </p>
        <p>It is also useful to update the database within a transaction
          if several processes concurrently update the same records.
          For example, the function <c>raise(Name, Amount)</c>, which 
          adds <c>Amount</c> to the salary field of a person, should
          be implemented as follows:
          </p>
        <code type="none">
raise(Name, Amount) ->
    mnesia:transaction(fun() ->
        case mnesia:wread({person, Name}) of
            [P] ->
                Salary = Amount + P#person.salary,
                P2 = P#person{salary = Salary},
                mnesia:write(P2);
            _ ->
                mnesia:abort("No such person")
        end
    end).
        </code>
        <p>When this function executes within a transaction, 
          several processes running on different nodes can concurrently
          execute the <c>raise/2</c> function without interfering 
          with each other. 
          </p>
        <p>Since Mnesia detects deadlocks, a transaction can be
          restarted any number of times.  This function will attempt a restart as specified in
          <c>Retries</c>. <c>Retries</c> must
          be an integer greater than 0 or the atom <c>infinity</c>. Default is

    <title>Configuration Parameters</title>
    <p>Mnesia reads the following application configuration
      parameters:</p>
    <list type="bulleted">
      <item>
        <p><c>-mnesia access_module Module</c>. The 
          name of the Mnesia activity access callback module. The default is
          <c>mnesia</c>.
          </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>-mnesia auto_repair true | false</c>. This flag controls
          whether Mnesia will try to automatically repair
          files that have not been properly closed. The default is 
          <c>true</c>.
          </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>-mnesia backup_module Module</c>. The 
          name of the Mnesia backup callback module. The default is
          <c>mnesia_backup</c>.
          </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>-mnesia debug Level</c>
          Controls the debug level of Mnesia.
          Possible values are:</p>
        <taglist>
          <tag><c>none</c></tag>
          <item>
            <p>No trace outputs at all. This is the default setting.
              </p>
          </item>
          <tag><c>verbose</c></tag>
          <item>
            <p>Activates tracing of important debug events. These
              debug events generate <c>{mnesia_info, Format, Args}</c>
              system events. Processes may subscribe to these events with
              <c>mnesia:subscribe/1</c>. The events are always sent to Mnesia's
              event handler. 
              </p>
          </item>
          <tag><c>debug</c></tag>
          <item>
            <p>Activates all events at the verbose level plus full
              trace of all debug events. These debug events generate
              <c>{mnesia_info, Format, Args}</c> system events. Processes may
              subscribe to these events with <c>mnesia:subscribe/1</c>. The
              events are always sent to the Mnesia event handler. On this
              debug level, the Mnesia event handler starts subscribing to
              updates in the schema table. 
              </p>
          </item>
          <tag><c>trace</c></tag>
          <item>
            <p>Activates all events at the level debug. On this
              debug level, the Mnesia event handler starts subscribing to
              updates on all Mnesia tables. This level is only intended
              for debugging  small toy systems since many large
              events may be generated.
              </p>
          </item>
          <tag><c>false</c></tag>
          <item>
            <p>An alias for none.
              </p>
          </item>
          <tag><c>true</c></tag>
          <item>
            <p>An alias for debug.
              </p>
          </item>
        </taglist>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>-mnesia core_dir Directory</c>. The name of the
          directory where Mnesia core files is stored or
          false. Setting it implies that also ram only nodes, will
          generate a core file if a crash occurs. </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>-mnesia dc_dump_limit Number</c>. 
          Controls how often <c>disc_copies</c> tables are dumped from memory.
          Tables are dumped when 
          <c>filesize(Log) > (filesize(Tab)/Dc_dump_limit)</c>.
          Lower values reduces cpu overhead but increases disk space and
          startup times. The default is 4.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>-mnesia dir Directory</c>. The name of the directory
          where all Mnesia data is stored. The name of the directory must
          be unique for the current node. Two nodes may, under no
          circumstances, share the same Mnesia directory. The results are
          totally unpredictable.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>-mnesia dump_log_load_regulation true | false</c>.
          Controls if the log dumps should be performed as fast as
          possible or if the dumper should do its own load
          regulation. This feature is temporary and will disappear in a
          future release. The default is <c>false</c>.
          </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>-mnesia dump_log_update_in_place true | false</c>.
          Controls if log dumps are performed on a copy of
          the original data file, or if  the log dump is 
          performed on the original data file. The default is <c>true</c></p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>-mnesia dump_log_write_threshold Max</c>, where
          <c>Max</c> is an integer which specifies the maximum number of writes
          allowed to the transaction log before a new dump of the log
          is performed. It defaults to 100 log writes.
          </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>-mnesia dump_log_time_threshold Max</c>,
          where <c>Max</c> is an integer which
          specifies the dump log interval in milliseconds. It defaults
          to 3 minutes. If a dump has not been performed within
          <c>dump_log_time_threshold</c> milliseconds, then a new dump is
          performed regardless of how many writes have been
          performed. 
          </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>-mnesia event_module Module</c>. The 
          name of the Mnesia event handler callback module. The default is
          <c>mnesia_event</c>.
          </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>-mnesia extra_db_nodes Nodes</c> specifies a list of
          nodes, in addition to the ones found in the schema, with which
          Mnesia should also establish contact. The default value
          is the empty list <c>[]</c>. 
          </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>-mnesia fallback_error_function {UserModule, UserFunc}</c>
          specifies a user supplied callback function
          which will be called if a fallback is installed and mnesia 
          goes down on another node. Mnesia will call the function
          with one argument the name of the dying node, e.g.
          <c>UserModule:UserFunc(DyingNode)</c>.
          Mnesia should be restarted or else
          the database could be inconsistent.
          The default behaviour is to terminate mnesia.
          </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>-mnesia max_wait_for_decision Timeout</c>. Specifies
          how long Mnesia will wait for other nodes to share their
          knowledge regarding the outcome of an unclear transaction.  By
          default the <c>Timeout</c> is set to the atom
          <c>infinity</c>, which implies that if Mnesia upon startup
          encounters a "heavyweight transaction" whose outcome is
          unclear, the local Mnesia will wait until Mnesia is started
          on some (in worst cases all) of the other nodes that were
          involved in the interrupted transaction. This is a very rare
          situation, but when/if it happens, Mnesia does not guess if
          the transaction on the other nodes was committed or aborted.
          Mnesia will wait until it knows the outcome and then act
          accordingly.
          </p>
        <p>If <c>Timeout</c> is set to an integer value in
          milliseconds, Mnesia will force "heavyweight transactions"
          to be finished, even if the outcome of the transaction for
          the moment is unclear. After <c>Timeout</c> milliseconds,
          Mnesia  will commit/abort the transaction and continue with
          the startup. This may lead to a situation where the
          transaction is committed on some nodes and aborted on other
          nodes. If the transaction was a schema transaction, the
          inconsistency may be fatal. 
          </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>-mnesia no_table_loaders NUMBER</c> specifies the number of
          parallel table loaders during start. More loaders can be good if the
          network latency is high or if many tables contains few records.
          The default value is <c>2</c>.
          </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>-mnesia send_compressed Level</c> specifies the level of
          compression to be used when copying a table from the local node to
          another one. The default level is 0.
          </p>
        <p><c>Level</c> must be an integer in the interval [0, 9], with 0
          representing no compression and 9 representing maximum compression.
          Before setting it to a non-zero value, make sure the remote nodes
          understand this configuration.
          </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>-mnesia schema_location Loc</c> controls where
          Mnesia will look for its schema. The parameter
          <c>Loc</c> may be one of the following atoms: </p>
        <taglist>
          <tag><c>disc</c></tag>
          <item>
            <p>Mandatory disc. The schema is assumed to be located
              in the Mnesia directory. If the schema cannot be found,
              Mnesia refuses to start. This is the old behavior.
              </p>
          </item>
          <tag><c>ram</c></tag>
          <item>
            <p>Mandatory RAM. The schema resides in RAM
              only. At start-up, a tiny new schema is generated. This
              default schema just contains the definition of the schema
              table and  only resides on the local node. Since no other
              nodes are found in the default schema, the configuration
              parameter  <c>extra_db_nodes</c> must be used in
              order to let the 
              node share its table definitions with other nodes. (The
              <c>extra_db_nodes</c> parameter may also be used on disc based nodes.)
              </p>
          </item>
          <tag><c>opt_disc</c></tag>
          <item>
            <p>Optional disc. The schema may reside either on disc
              or in RAM. If the schema is found on disc, Mnesia starts as a
              disc based node and the storage type of the schema table is
              <c>disc_copies</c>. If no schema is found on disc, Mnesia starts
              as a disc-less node and the storage type of the schema table is
              <c>ram_copies</c>. The default value for the application parameter
              is <c>opt_disc</c>.  
              </p>
          </item>
        </taglist>
      </item>
    </list>
    <p>First the SASL application parameters are checked, then
      the command line flags are checked, and finally, the default
      value is chosen.
