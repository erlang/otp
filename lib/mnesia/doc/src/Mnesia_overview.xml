    <p>The management of data in telecommunications systems has many
      aspects of which some, but not all, are addressed by traditional
      Database Management Systems (DBMSs). In particular, the
      high level of fault tolerance required in many nonstop
      systems, combined with requirements on the DBMS to run in the same
      address space as the applications, have led us to implement a new
      DBMS, called Mnesia.</p>
    <p>Mnesia is implemented in, and tightly coupled to Erlang.
      It provides the functionality that is necessary for the
      implementation of fault-tolerant telecommunications systems.</p>
    <p>Mnesia is a multiuser distributed DBMS specifically designed for
      industrial-grade telecommunications applications written in Erlang,
      which is also the intended target language.
      Mnesia tries to address all the data management issues required for
      typical telecommunications systems and has a number of features not
      normally found in traditional DBMSs.</p>
    <p>Telecommunications applications need a mix of a broad range
      of features generally not provided by traditional DBMSs.
      Mnesia is designed to meet requirements such as:</p>
    <list type="bulleted">
      <item>Fast real-time key-value lookup
      </item>
      <item>Complex non-real-time queries
        (mainly for operation and maintenance tasks)
      </item>
      <item>Distributed data
        (due to the distributed nature of the applications)
      </item>
      <item>High fault tolerance
      </item>
      <item>Dynamic reconfiguration
      </item>
      <item>Complex objects
      </item>
    </list>
    <p>Mnesia addresses the typical data management issues required for
      telecommunications applications which sets it apart from most other DBMSs.
      It combines many concepts found in traditional DBMSs, such as transactions
      and queries, with concepts found in data management systems for
      telecommunications applications such as:</p>
      <list type="bulleted">
        <item>Fast real-time operations
        </item>
        <item>Configurable replication for fault tolerance
        </item>
        <item>Dynamic reconfiguration without service disruption
        </item>
      </list>
    <p>Mnesia is also unique due to its tight coupling to
      Erlang. It almost turns Erlang into a database programming
      language, which yields many benefits. The foremost is that
      the impedance mismatch between the data format used by the DBMS
      and the data format used by the programming language, which is used
      to manipulate the data, completely disappears.</p>

    <section>
      <title>Features</title>
      <p>Mnesia has the following features that combine to
        produce a fault-tolerant distributed database management
        system (DBMS) written in Erlang:
        </p>
      <list type="bulleted">
        <item>Database schema can be dynamically reconfigured at runtime.
        </item>
        <item>Tables can be declared to have properties such as location,
          replication, and persistence.
        </item>
        <item>Tables can be moved or replicated to several nodes to improve
          fault tolerance. Other nodes in the system can still access the
          tables to read, write, and delete records.
        </item>
        <item>Table locations are transparent to the programmer.
          Programs address table names and the system itself keeps track of
          table locations.
        </item>
        <item>Transactions can be distributed and multiple
          operations can be executed within a single transaction.
        </item>
        <item>Multiple transactions can run concurrently and their execution
          is fully synchronized by Mnesia, ensuring that no
          two processes manipulate the same data simultaneously.
        </item>
        <item>Transactions can be assigned the property of being executed on
          all nodes in the system, or on none.
        </item>
        <item>Transactions can be bypassed using dirty operations,
          which reduce overheads and run fast.
        </item>
      </list>
      <p>All of the above features are described in detail
        in the coming sections.</p>

    <section>
      <title>Query List Comprehension</title>
      <p>Query List Comprehension (QLC) can be used with Mnesia
        to produce specialized functions that enhance its operational
        ability. QLC has its own documentation as part
        of the OTP documentation set. The main QLC advantages
        when used with Mnesia are:</p>
      <list type="bulleted">
        <item>QLC can optimize the query compiler for Mnesia,
          essentially making the system more efficient.
        </item>
        <item>QLC can be used as a database programming
          language for Mnesia. It includes a notation called list
          comprehensions which can be used to execute complex database
          queries over a set of tables.
        </item>
      </list>
      <p>For more information about QLC, please see the
        <seeerl marker="stdlib:qlc">qlc</seeerl> manual page
        in STDLIB.</p>

      <title>When to Use Mnesia</title>
        <p>Mnesia is a great fit for applications that:</p>
        <list type="bulleted">
          <item>Need to replicate data.
          </item>
          <item>Perform complex data queries.
          </item>
          <item>Need to use atomic transactions to
            safely update several records simultaneously.
          </item>
          <item>Require soft real-time characteristics.
          </item>
        </list>
        <p>Mnesia is not as appropriate for applications that:</p>
        <list type="bulleted">
          <item>Process plain text or binary data files.
          </item>
          <item>Merely need a lookup dictionary that
            can be stored on disc. Such applications may use the standard
            library module <c>dets</c>, which is a disc-based version
            of the <c>ets</c> module. For more information about <c>dets</c>,
            please see the <seeerl marker="stdlib:dets">dets</seeerl>
            manual page in STDLIB.
          </item>
          <item>Need disc logging facilities.
            Such applications may use the module <c>disk_log</c>.
            For more information about <c>disk_log</c>, please see the
            <seeerl marker="kernel:disk_log">disk_log</seeerl>
            manual page in Kernel.
          </item>
          <item>Require hard real-time characteristics.
