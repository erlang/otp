  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-18490 Aux Id: OTP-18471, GH-6339, PR-6843

## Mnesia 4.21.4.3

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

* Mnesia could crash during startup if `del_table_copy/2` and `add_table_copy/3` was invoked when the table was loading.

  Own Id: OTP-19076 Aux Id: ERIERL-1073

## Mnesia 4.21.4.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- `mnesia:add_table_copy/3` no longer fails with reason system_limit when the
  node is starting.

  Own Id: OTP-18850

## Mnesia 4.21.4.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Do not delete old backup file if the new backup fails.

  Own Id: OTP-18711 Aux Id: ERIERL-963

## Mnesia 4.21.4

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Improved consistency for dirty writes when a table was added with
  `add_table_copy/3`.

  Fixed a problem with sticky write, which could lead to inconsistent data.

  Own Id: OTP-18412

### Improvements and New Features

- Replace size/1 with either tuple_size/1 or byte_size/1

  The [`size/1`](`size/1`) BIF is not optimized by the JIT, and its use can
  result in worse types for Dialyzer.

  When one knows that the value being tested must be a tuple,
  [`tuple_size/1`](`tuple_size/1`) should always be preferred.

  When one knows that the value being tested must be a binary,
  [`byte_size/1`](`byte_size/1`) should be preferred. However,
  [`byte_size/1`](`byte_size/1`) also accepts a bitstring (rounding up size to a
  whole number of bytes), so one must make sure that the call to `byte_size/` is
  preceded by a call to [`is_binary/1`](`is_binary/1`) to ensure that bitstrings
  are rejected. Note that the compiler removes redundant calls to
  [`is_binary/1`](`is_binary/1`), so if one is not sure whether previous code
  had made sure that the argument is a binary, it does not harm to add an
  [`is_binary/1`](`is_binary/1`) test immediately before the call to
  [`byte_size/1`](`byte_size/1`).

  Own Id: OTP-15201 Aux Id: PR-1881

- When master node is set do not force a load from ram_copies replica when there
  are no available disc_copies, since that would load an empty table. Wait until
  a disk replica is available or until user explicitly force_loads the table.

  Own Id: OTP-15221 Aux Id: ERIERL-217

- Allow to add replicas even if all other replicas are down when the other
  replicas are not stored on disk.

  Own Id: OTP-15226 Aux Id: ERIERL-221

  a disk replica is available or until user explicitly force_loads the table.

  Own Id: OTP-15221 Aux Id: ERIERL-217

- Allow to add replicas even if all other replicas are down when the other
  replicase are not stored on disk.

  Own Id: OTP-15226 Aux Id: ERIERL-221

## Mnesia 4.15.3

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Removed a quadratic behavior in startup. This change implies that backend
  plugins (if used) must be set when the schema is created or via configuration
  parameters before mnesia is started.

  Own Id: OTP-14829 Aux Id: ERIERL-84

- Bad timing could crash mnesia after a checkpoint was deactivated and
  reactivated with the same checkpoint name on different tables.

  locks for a long time and restarting mnesia.

  Own Id: OTP-13970 Aux Id: Seq-13198

- Change mnesia_tm process to have off-heap messages since mnesia_tm can be the
  receiver of many non-synchronized message from other nodes.

  Own Id: OTP-14074

## Mnesia 4.14.1

### Improvements and New Features

- Correct some minor documentation issues.

  Own Id: OTP-13891

## Mnesia 4.14

### Improvements and New Features

- Added experimental external backend plugin api. This adds the possibility for
  the user to write other storage backends for data, for example by using shared
  memory or ram-cached disk storage.

  The plugin api may change in future versions after being battle tested.

  Own Id: OTP-13058

## Mnesia 4.13

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Mnesia's dirty functions did not always exit with `{aborted, Reason}` as
  documented when an error occurred.

  Own Id: OTP-12714

- Consider file descriptors limits (emfile) as a fatal error and do not delete
  log files. Previously the error was seen as a corrupted disk and the log files
  deleted which caused data loss.

  Own Id: OTP-12807

### Improvements and New Features

- Make Mnesia DCD dump behavior at start up optional, when turned off mnesia
  loads large disc_copies tables faster.

- The time for inserting locks for a transaction with large number of locks is
  reduced significantly.

  Own Id: OTP-11981

## Mnesia 4.12

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Some local implementations of removing the last element from a list are
  replaced by `lists:droplast/1`. Note that this requires at least `stdlib-2.0`,
  which is the stdlib version delivered in OTP 17.0. (Thanks to Hans Svensson)

  Own Id: OTP-11678

- Application upgrade (appup) files are corrected for the following
  applications:

  `asn1, common_test, compiler, crypto, debugger, dialyzer, edoc, eldap, erl_docgen, et, eunit, gs, hipe, inets, observer, odbc, os_mon, otp_mibs, parsetools, percept, public_key, reltool, runtime_tools, ssh, syntax_tools, test_server, tools, typer, webtool, wx, xmerl`

  A new test utility for testing appup files is added to test_server. This is
  now used by most applications in OTP.

  (Thanks to Tobias Schlager)

  Own Id: OTP-11744

### Improvements and New Features

- To prevent a race condition if there is a short communication problem when
  node-down and node-up events are received. They are now stored and later
  checked if the node came up just before mnesia flagged the node as down.
  (Thanks to Jonas Falkevik )

  Own Id: OTP-11497

- Added `mnesia:sync_log/0` to explicit sync mnesias transaction log.

  Own Id: OTP-11729

## Mnesia 4.11

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

  Own Id: OTP-10957

### Improvements and New Features

- Fixed a problem where the fallback BUP file is removed when calling
  mnesia:uninstall_fallback and mnesia is not started.

  Own Id: OTP-11241

## Mnesia 4.9

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- If mnesia:clear_table/2 was called during a table load on that table, the
  schema record was written to the table instead of clearing table.

  Own Id: OTP-11030 Aux Id: seq12267

### Improvements and New Features

- Optimize index creation for Mnesia set tables. Thanks to Nick Marino.

  Own Id: OTP-11103

## Mnesia 4.8

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Use chained send_after instead of send_interval, to make decrease the number
  of messages sent after a sleep (Thanks to James Wheare)

  Own Id: OTP-10636

- Fix format of mnesia overload message (Thanks to Ahmed Omar)

  Own Id: OTP-10639

### Improvements and New Features

  for the Erlang VM and mnesia have been incorporated in the framework.

  For details about how to add more benchmarks see $ERL_TOP/HOWTO/BENCHMARKS.md
  in the source distribution.

  Own Id: OTP-10156

- Where necessary a comment stating encoding has been added to Erlang files. The
  comment is meant to be removed in Erlang/OTP R17B when UTF-8 becomes the
  default encoding.

  Own Id: OTP-10630

- Remove support for the query keyword and query expressions. Thanks to Loïc
  Hoguin.

  Own Id: OTP-10729

## Mnesia 4.7.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Add tests showing that trying to delete non-existing object may corrupt the

  In case of bag tables, trying to delete a non-existing object leads to the
  index becoming corrupt. This happens if the non-existing object we try to
  delete happens to share its key and index field value with a single existing
  object in the table. Result: The index entry corresponding to the existing
  object is removed.

  Prevent index from being corrupted if a nonexistent item is deleted

  We have to ensure that we actually delete the last object with a given (key,
  index) pair before removing the index. Thanks to Bartlomiej Puzon

  Own Id: OTP-10220

## Mnesia 4.7

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Returns the same value for mnesia_loader:disc_load_table/2 as
  mnesia_loader:net_load_table/4 if a table copy cannot be found. (Thanks to Uwe
  Dauernheim)

  Own Id: OTP-10015

### Improvements and New Features

- Improved table lock algorithm.

  Own Id: OTP-9890

## Mnesia 4.6

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Reduce calls to phash in key_to_frag_number

  Original code calls phash 1..2 times, based on which fragment the hashed key
  targets and how many fragments exist. New code always calls phash only once.

  Add mnesia_frag_hash test (Thanks to Philip Robinson)

  Own Id: OTP-9722

- Fixed a sticky lock bug which caused mnesia:read(Tab, Key, write) return
  undefined.

  Own Id: OTP-9786

- Use the synchronous log_terms instead of alog_terms in mnesia_log:ets2dcd()

  This avoids the situation where mnesia could dump a very large ets table in
  its entirety into the message queue of the disk_log process, causing memory
  blowup and choking the disk logger. (Thanks to Richard Carlsson)

  Own Id: OTP-9804

### Improvements and New Features

- Implemented a new option to mnesia:create_table/2 which allows the user to
  assign 'ets' and 'dets' options not available in mnesia.

  Own Id: OTP-8970

## Mnesia 4.5.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fix deadlock in mnesia:del_table_copy/2.

  Own Id: OTP-9473

- XML files have been corrected.

  Own Id: OTP-9550 Aux Id: OTP-9541

### Improvements and New Features

- Dump the log even if no transactions have been invoked on local node,
  otherwise the log will grow forever with decisions from the other nodes who
  have tables on disk. Thanks Marek Majkowski.

  Own Id: OTP-9551

- Use dedicated api for clear_table, i.e. instead of match_delete use
  delete_all_objects. Thanks KukHyun Lee.

  Own Id: OTP-9558

## Mnesia 4.4.19

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Mnesia could crash if mnesia:add_table_index/2 was invoked before the table
  was loaded on all nodes.

  Own Id: OTP-9285 Aux Id: seq11844

- Add \{majority, boolean()\} per-table option.

  With \{majority, true\} set for a table, write transactions will abort if they
  cannot commit to a majority of the nodes that have a copy of the table.
  Currently, the implementation hooks into the prepare_commit, and forces an
  asymmetric transaction if the commit set affects any table with the majority
  flag set. In the commit itself, the transaction will abort if it cannot
  satisfy the majority requirement for all tables involved in the
  transaction.(Thanks to Ulf Wiger)

## Mnesia 4.4.18

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Call chmod without the "-f" flag

  "-f" is a non-standard chmod option which at least SGI IRIX and HP UX do not
  support. As the only effect of the "-f" flag is to suppress warning messages,
  it can be safely omitted. (Thanks to Holger Weiß)

- Mnesia sometimes failed to update meta-information in large systems, which
  could cause table content to be inconsistent between nodes.

## Mnesia 4.4.17

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Calling mnesia:first/1 on empty fragmented table works. Thanks Magnus Henoch.

  Own Id: OTP-9108

- If Mnesia detects that the network is not fully connected during start, Mnesia
  will not start until all nodes are reachable.

## Mnesia 4.4.11

### Improvements and New Features

- Fixed duplicate results with mnesia:index_read() on ordered_set tables.
  Reported by Sam Bobroff.

  Fixed locking in mnesia:index_read() which now grabs a read table lock to
  ensure correctness, this may slow down the operation or block other processes
  trying to reach the same table.

  Calling mnesia:dump_log() could crash mnesia, Reported by Igor Ribeiro
  Sucupira.

## Mnesia 4.4.9

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- mnesia:clear_table/1 crashed instead of returning `{aborted,..}` if it was
  called inside a transaction.

  Own Id: OTP-7911

## Mnesia 4.4.8

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- With bad timing several api functions could return or exit with a bad error
  message when mnesia was shutting down.

  Own Id: OTP-7753 Aux Id: seq11179

- `mnesia:clear_table/1` cleared all nodes table content even if the table was
  `local_content` only type.

  Own Id: OTP-7835

## Mnesia 4.4.7

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Disallowed match patterns ('\_', and '$n') as argument to
  `mnesia:delete_object/1` and friends.

  Own Id: OTP-7524

### Improvements and New Features

- Introduced a few new functions in Mnesia: `mnesia:read/2`, `mnesia:first/3`,
  `mnesia:last/3`, `mnesia:prev/4`, `mnesia:next/4`, `mnesia_frag:first/1`,
  `mnesia_frag:last/1`, `mnesia_frag:prev/2`, `mnesia_frag:next/2`.

## Mnesia 4.4.6

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- `mnesia:restore/2` aborted if a `EXIT` message appeared in the client message
  queue.

  Own Id: OTP-7585 Aux Id: seq11046

## Mnesia 4.4.5

### Improvements and New Features

- mnesia:clear_table/1 does not require that all replicas of the table are
  available anymore.

  Own Id: OTP-7466 Aux Id: seq11015

## Mnesia 4.4.4

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Mnesia did not garbage collect transaction decisions on disk based nodes if no
  transactions where made on the local node.

  Own Id: OTP-7419

## Mnesia 4.4.3

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Table referred to by foreign key did not have node_pool properly cleaned up
  when a node was removed from the schema. Thanks Paul Mineiro.

  Own Id: OTP-7340

- Mnesia crashed and generated a core dump if a schema_transaction was running
  when mnesia stopped.

  Own Id: OTP-7378 Aux Id: seq10964

### Improvements and New Features

- It is now possible to delete a db node even when other disk resident nodes are
  down. Thanks Paul Mineiro.

  Own Id: OTP-7383

## Mnesia 4.4.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Sticky locks could lead to hanging transactions.

  Own Id: OTP-7205 Aux Id: seq10793

- `mnesia:snmp_get_next_index/2` didn't work with partial index keys. Argument
  checking is now done according to documentation, in functions
  `mnesia:snmp_get_row/2`, `mnesia:snmp_get_mnesia_key/2` and
  `mnesia:snmp_get_next_index/2`. These functions now require that `RowIndex` is
  a list.

## Mnesia 4.4.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Snmp index tables was not initialized correctly in `mnesia-4.4`.

  Own Id: OTP-7170 Aux Id: seq10870

### Known Bugs and Problems

- Rearranging fragmented tables is an O(N^2) operation.

  Own Id: OTP-6300

## Mnesia 4.4

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Mnesia ignored the module argument to `mnesia:restore/2`. Thanks Paul Minerio.

  Own Id: OTP-6981

### Improvements and New Features

- Mnesia's snmp operations `snmp_get_row/2`, `snmp_get_next_index/2` and
  `snmp_get_mnesia_key/2` have been made context aware, i.e. inside a
  transaction they will compensate for table updates made in earlier in the same
  transaction. This might cause a performance drop if a lot of updates have been
  made before the invocation of these functions.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-6856 Aux Id: seq10671

- Introduced erlang:phash/2 as new default for fragmented tables. Already
  existing tables will continue to use whatever hash function they where using.
