%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%
%% This module is used for testing the backup module config parameter.
%%
%% This module is an impostor for the mnesia_backup module.
%%
%%
%% Original doc below:
%%
%% This module contains one implementation of callback functions
%% used by Mnesia at backup and restore. The user may however
%% write an own module the same interface as mnesia_backup and
%% configure Mnesia so the alternate module performs the actual
%% accesses to the backup media. This means that the user may put
%% the backup on medias that Mnesia does not know about, possibly
%% on hosts where Erlang is not running.
%%
%% The OpaqueData argument is never interpreted by other parts of
%% Mnesia. It is the property of this module. Alternate implementations
%% of this module may have different interpretations of OpaqueData.
%% The OpaqueData argument given to open_write/1 and open_read/1
%% are forwarded directly from the user.
%%
%% All functions must return {ok, NewOpaqueData} or {error, Reason}.
%%
%% The NewOpaqueData arguments returned by backup callback functions will
%% be given as input when the next backup callback function is invoked.
%% If any return value does not match {ok, _} the backup will be aborted.
%%
%% The NewOpaqueData arguments returned by restore callback functions will
%% be given as input when the next restore callback function is invoked
%% If any return value does not match {ok, _} the restore will be aborted.
