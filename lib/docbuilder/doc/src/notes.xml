	    the following message
	    "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: factor &lt; 0; was:
	    -1". <br/> This is a known bug in fop 1.0 (fop bug id:
	    Bug 50524) when there is a word that consist of a single
	    soft hyphen (&amp;shy;). this has been fixed in fop
	    source archive but not it's not in a release yet. It's
	    fixed in our documentation by removing the soft hyphens
	    where this is a problem. </p>

	    bif's are removed in the generated links so the links
	    will look like
	    "http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#append_element-2"
	    instead of
	    "http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#erlang:append_element-2".</p>
	    <p>- Enhanced the menu positioning in the html
	    documentation when a new page is loaded.</p>

	    pages (thanks to Sergei Golovan)</p>
	    <p>- The legal notice is taken from the xml book file so

	    applications.</p>
