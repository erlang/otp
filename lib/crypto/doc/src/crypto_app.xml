  <appsummary>The Crypto Application</appsummary>
  <description>
    <p>The purpose of the Crypto application is to provide an Erlang API
    to cryptographic functions, see <seealso marker="crypto">crypto(3)</seealso>.
    Note that the API is on a fairly low level and there are some
    corresponding API functions available in <seealso marker="public_key:public_key">public_key(3)</seealso>,
    on a higher abstraction level, that uses the crypto application in its implementation.
    </p>

    <title>DEPENDENCIES</title>

    <p>The current crypto implementation uses nifs to interface OpenSSLs crypto library
    and requires <em>OpenSSL</em> package version 0.9.8 or higher.</p>
    <p>Source releases of OpenSSL can be downloaded from the <url href="http://www.openssl.org">OpenSSL</url> project home page,
    or mirror sites listed there.
