	    The documentation is now built with open source tools
	    (xsltproc and fop) that exists on most platforms. One
	    visible change is that the frames are removed.</p>

	    When the crypto application failed to load the
	    OpenSSL/LibEAY shared object, error indication was
	    sparse. Now a more specific error message is sent to the
	    error logger.</p>

            changes in its API before it reaches 1.0.</p>
          <p>Also, more cryptographic algorithms have been added to

          <p>Linked in drivers in the crypto, and asn1 applications

            Hinde who sent us a patch.</p>
          <p>Linked in driver in crypto, and port programs in ssl, now

          <p>Corrected error handling. If the port to the driver that
            crypto uses is unexpectedly closed (which should not
            happen during normal operation of crypto), crypto will
            terminate immediately (rather than crashing the next time
            crypto is used). Also corrected build problems on Mac OS
            X.</p>

          <p>It was not possible in R9 to relink the crypto driver.
            The object file was missing as well as an example
            makefile. The crypto driver object file is now released
            with the application (installed in priv/obj). An example
            makefile has also been added to the priv/obj directory.
            The makefile serves as an example of how to relink the
            driver on Unix (crypto_drv.so) or Windows
            (crypto_drv.dll).</p>

          <p>Previous versions of Crypto where delivered with
            statically linked binaries based on SSLeay. That is not
            longer the case.  The current version of Crypto requires
            dynamically linked OpenSSL libraries that the user has to
            install. The library needed is <c>libcrypto.so</c> (Unix)
            or <c>libeay32.[lib|dll]</c> (Win32). For further details
            see the crypto(6) application manual page.</p>

        <item>
          <p>This version of Crypto uses the new DES interface of
            OpenSSL 0.9.7, which is not backward compatible with
            earlier versions of OpenSSL.

        <item>The functions <c>des_ede3_cbc_encrypt/5</c> and
