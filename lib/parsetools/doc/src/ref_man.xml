    <p>The <em>Parsetools</em> application contains utilities for
      parsing and scanning. Yecc is an <term id="LALR-1"></term>parser
      generator for Erlang, similar to yacc. Yecc takes a <term
      id="BNF"></term>grammar definition as input, and produces Erlang
      code for a parser as output. Leex is a regular expression based
      lexical analyzer generator for Erlang, similar to lex or flex.</p>
