The original JAM compiler was first implemented by Joe Armstrong.

The original BEAM compiler (v1) was first implemented by Bogumil Hausman.

The original v2 and v3 compilers were implemented by Robert Virding.
Björn Gustavsson adapted the code generation for the BEAM machine and
added the optimisation passes.

General improvements and corrections were made by Robert Virding,
Arndt Jonasson, Tony Rogvall, Björn Gustavsson and Jan-Erik Dahlin.

The bit syntax support was implemented by Björn Gustavsson, Arndt Jonasson
and Robert Virding.

The Core Erlang is used as an intermediate format in the v3 compiler (R7).
Core Erlang was suggested by Richard Carlsson (HiPE).

The new inliner in R8 is written by Richard Carlsson (HiPE).

Updates, extensions, and bugfixes in the R8 compiler were made by Robert Virding,
Richard Carlsson (HiPE), and Björn Gustavsson.

Bjorn Gustavsson and Raimo Niskanen implemented the beam_validator compiler
pass for R10B-2 (it makes that the compiler did not generate code that could
crash the run-time system).

The current maintainer of the compiler is Bjorn Gustavsson. To the R12B he
added a simple form of stack trimming, as well as other optimizations.
