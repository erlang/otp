## Explanation

This error is generated by the Erlang linter when you try to create, update,
or pattern-match a record using a field name that does not exist in that
record's definition. Records in Erlang have a fixed set of named fields,
and their names are known at compile-time. It is not allowed to define a
new field outside of the record definition.

To fix this error, first check the spellings of field names to make sure
you are using a defined record field. If you mean to add the missing field
to the record, add it to the record definition. Alternatively, if you need
a more flexible data structure that can have dynamic keys, a map might
be more suitable.

To learn more about records, please refer to the [Reference Manual](`e:system:ref_man_records`).
