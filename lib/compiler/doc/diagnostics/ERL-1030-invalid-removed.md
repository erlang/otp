# ERL-1030 - Badly formed removed attribute

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-removed([{{badly,formed},1}]).
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:2:2: badly formed removed attribute {{badly,formed},1}
%    2| -removed([{{badly,formed},1}]).
%     |  ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1030` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This error is generated by the Erlang linter when the removed attribute
`-removed` is written in an invalid format. Allowed formats are the following,
where `Name` is an atom and `Arity` is an integer:

- An atom as the module name.
- A tuple `{Name, Arity}`
- A list of tuples `[{Name1, Arity1}, ..., {NameN, ArityN}]`
- A list of tuples `[{Name1, Arity1, Info1}, ..., {NameN, ArityN, InfoN}]`
where each `InfoI` is a string.
- A list `[Name1/Arity1, ..., NameN/ArityN]`

To fix this error, ensure that the removed attribute is not missing the
brackets if it needs to be a list, and each item conforms to the syntax
rules above.
