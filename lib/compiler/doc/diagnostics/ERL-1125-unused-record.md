# ERL-1125 - Unused record

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-export([t/0]).
-record(r, {a,b}).
t() -> ok.
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:3:2: Warning: record r is unused
%    3| -record(r, {a,b}).
%     |  ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1125` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This warning is generated by the Erlang linter when a record is defined
in a module, but it is never created, updated, accessed, or used in any
pattern-matching. This warning is enabled by default. It can be turned off
by adding the compile option `nowarn_unused_record`.

There are many ways to fix this warning. Firstly, this warning can be raised
at the same time as many other record-related errors. For example, when
a user creates a record with an invalid field name, the linter does not
consider that a valid record usage. If there is no other usage of the same
record, this warning will be raised. If this is the case, fixing the other
more specific warning will be the first step towards fixing this warning.

Using the specified record can also remove this warning. Alternatively,
remove the unused record definition from this module or move it to a module
where it will be used.

If the intention is to suppress this warning for this module, use `-compile(nowarn_unused_record)`.
If this warning should only be suppressed for certain record(s), write
it like this `-compile({nowarn_unused_record,a}).` to name specific records.
