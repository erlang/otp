# ERL-0007 - Syntax error

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
t() -> X,
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:2:9: syntax error before: 
%    2| t() -> X,
%     |         ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-0007` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This is one of the most common errors generated by the Erlang parser. It
occurs when the compiler detects that the source code does not follow Erlang's
syntactic rules. In the example above, the function `t()` ends with a comma
`,` instead of a period `.`. Erlang function clauses should end with a period.

Fixing the problem in the example is easy. However, this error can be caused
by various reasons: missing delimiters (`.`, `,`, `;`), unmatched parentheses
or brackets, misplaced operators, or incomplete constructs, etc. When this
error is emitted together with other errors from the Erlang linter, other
errors are usually more specific. Fixing them would also fix this error,
or isolate where the syntax error happens.
