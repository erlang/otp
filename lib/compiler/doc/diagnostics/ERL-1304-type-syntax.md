# ERL-1304 - Bad type syntax

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-type a() :: 0..inf.
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:2:14: bad range type
%    2| -type a() :: 0..inf.
%     |              ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1304` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This error is generated by the Erlang linter when it sees an invalid type
syntax. Type syntax errors that do not belong to other existing type of
errors are raised here. In the example, `0..inf` is an invalid integer
range, as `inf` is not an integer value in Erlang. The correct syntax for
non-negative integers is `non_neg_integer()` or `0..`.

To fix this error, make sure the type syntax conform to Erlang's predefined
types. It may happen that Erlang's type syntax cannot express your intent
precisely. The Erlang linter will reject all type syntaxes it does not
recognize.

To learn more about types, please refer to the [Reference Manual](`e:system:typespec`).
