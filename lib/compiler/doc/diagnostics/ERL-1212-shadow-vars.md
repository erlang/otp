# ERL-1212 - Shadowed variable

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-export([t/1]).
t(A) ->
    B = foo,
    [B || B <- A],
    B.
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:5:11: Warning: variable 'B' shadowed in generate
%    5|     [B || B <- A],
%     |           ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1212` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This warning is generated by the Erlang linter when a variable in a fun head
or generator has the same name as another variable from the outer scope.
In the fun head or the generator, the binding for the variable from the
outer scope will be hidden, thus it is called a shadowed variable. Shadowing
is legal, but it often leads to confusion.

To fix this warning, rename the variable in the fun head or generator to be
different with all variables used in the outer scope. Alternatively, if
this warning should be suppressed, add the compile option `nowarn_shadow_vars`
to the list of compile options.

To learn more about variable shadowing rules, please refer to the [Reference Manual](`e:system:expressions`).
