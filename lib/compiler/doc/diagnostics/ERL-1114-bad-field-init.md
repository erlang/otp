# ERL-1114 - Bad field initialization


## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-export([t/1]).
-record(r, {f}).
t(#r{f = 17, _ = V}) -> V.
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:4:14: '_' initializes no omitted fields
%    4| t(#r{f = 17, _ = V}) -> V.
%     |              ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1114` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This error is generated by the Erlang linter when you use the wildcard field
name `_` but the usage does not assign or bind any field. When creating or
matching a record, `_` can be used to assign or bind the same value to all
the omitted fields, like `#Name{Field1=Expr1, _=ExprL}`. If there is no
omitted field left that can be assigned or bound using `_`, this error
will be raised.

In the example above, there is only one field `f` in the record `#r{}`.
The function `t/1` tries to match for `f` and another field in `#r{}`.
The compiler knows that there is no other field than `f` in `#r{}`, so `_`
does not match any omitted fields.

To fix this error, you can remove the `_` expression since the omitted fields
no longer exist. Alternatively, check if any record field is removed from
the definition by mistake.

To learn more about records, please refer to the [Reference Manual](`e:system:ref_man_records`).
