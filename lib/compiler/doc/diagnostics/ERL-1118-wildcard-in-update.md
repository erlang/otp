# ERL-1118 - Record update with _

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-export([t/1]).
-record(r, {a,b}).
t(R) -> R#r{_ = 4}.
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:4:13: meaningless use of _ in update of record r
%    4| t(R) -> R#r{_ = 4}.
%     |             ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1118` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This error is generated by the Erlang linter when you use `_` as a field
name in record update. `_` can be used in record creation to set all omitted
field at once, or in pattern-matching to match all omitted fields. It is
not allowed in record update to change the value of all omitted fields.

To fix this error, explicitly name the fields that should be updated in
the record. All omitted fields in a record update will keep their old values.
Alternatively, if the intention is not updating the record, check corresponding
record syntaxes.

To learn more about records, please refer to the [Reference Manual](`e:system:ref_man_records`).
