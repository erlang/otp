# ERL-1210 - Variable exported

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-export([t/1]).
t(X) ->
    if X -> Z = 1 end,
    Z = 1.
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:5:5: Warning: variable 'Z' exported from 'if' (line 4, column 5)
%    5|     Z = 1.
%     |     ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1210` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This warning is generated by the Erlang linter when a variable is bound in
an `if`, `case`, or `receive` expression and it is used outside of it.
If the variable is used in matching, this warning will always be raised.
If the variable is not used in matching, this warning will only be raised
when the compile option `warn_export_vars` is enabled.

To fix this warning, bind the exported variable outside of the `if`, `case`,
or `receive` expression by returning it. The example above can be rewritten
like this:

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-export([t/1]).
t(X) ->
    Z = if X -> 1 end,
    Z = 1.
```

Alternatively, remove `warn_export_vars` from the compile options to disable
this warning outside of matching.
