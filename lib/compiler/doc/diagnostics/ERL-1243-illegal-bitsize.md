# ERL-1243 - Illegal bit size

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-export([t/1]).
t(<<X:bad_size>>) -> X.
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:3:5: Warning: this clause cannot match because 'bad_size' is not a valid size for a binary segment
%    3| t(<<X:bad_size>>) -> X.
%     |     ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1243` to see a detailed explanation

foo.erl:3:7: Warning: a size expression in a pattern evaluates to a non-integer value;
this pattern cannot possibly match
%    3| t(<<X:bad_size>>) -> X.
%     |       ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1243` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This warning is generated by the Erlang linter when it sees an illegal size
in a binary segment. When constructing a binary, size should be an expression
that evaluates to an integer. When matching a binary, size should be a
guard expression that uses literals and previously bound variables. Binary
matching has stricter requirements for allowed size expressions.

For a float segment, its bit size must be 16, 32, or 64. All other bit
sizes are illegal. 

To fix this warning, change the size in binary matching to a guard satisfying
the requirements above. Not all function calls are allowed in a binary size
when matching. If you need to do more pattern-matching on the size of the
binary, you can match out the size and do more later.

To learn more about the binary size, please refer to the [Reference Manual](`e:system:expressions#bit-syntax-expressions`).
