# ERL-1320 - Type already exported

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-export_type([t/0,t/0]).
-type t() :: integer().
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:2:2: Warning: type t/0 already exported
%    2| -export_type([t/0,t/0]).
%     |  ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1320` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This warning is generated by the Erlang linter when a type is exported
more than once using `-export_type`. Compilation succeeds, but the linter
warns as repeatedly exporting types is likely not the intention.

To fix this warning, check all the `-export_type` attributes and remove
types that are exported more than once. Ensure that all exported types
have correct names and arities so they are not duplicating other types
by mistake.

To learn more about types, please refer to the [Reference Manual](`e:system:typespec`).
