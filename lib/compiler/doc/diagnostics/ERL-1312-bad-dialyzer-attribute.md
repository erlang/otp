# ERL-1312 - Bad Dialyzer attribute

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-dialyzer(1).
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:2:2: badly formed dialyzer attribute: 1
%    2| -dialyzer(1).
%     |  ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1312` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This error is generated by the Erlang linter when it sees a bad Dialyzer
attribute in `-dialyzer()`. The dialyzer attribute can be used to turn on
and off warnings in a module. There are a list of recognized Dialyzer
options that can be used in the attribute. They are either atoms or 2-tuples.
If the linter sees anything other than an atom, a 2-tuple, or a list containing
atoms and 2-tuples in the Dialyzer attribute, it will raise this error.

To fix this error, check spellings and forms of the Dialyzer attribute.
If there are more than one options in a dialyzer attribute, put them in
a list. If you are unsure about which options to use, check [Dialyzer documentation](e:dialyzer:dialyzer#warning_options).
