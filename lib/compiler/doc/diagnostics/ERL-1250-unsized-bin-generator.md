# ERL-1250 - Unsized binary generator pattern

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-export([t/1]).
t(Bin) -> [ X || <<X,42/bits>> <= Bin ].
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:3:22: binary fields without size are not allowed in patterns of bit string generators
%    3| t(Bin) -> [ X || <<X,42/bits>> <= Bin ].
%     |                      ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1250` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This error is generated by the Erlang linter when it sees a binary field
without size in a bitstring pattern of a comprehension generator. A generator
pattern will be matched repeated against the expression. Unsized binary
field can only be used to match the rest of the binary, and only once.
It cannot be used in a generator pattern. Otherwise, it is unclear how
many bits should be consumed every time.

To fix this error, add an explicit size to all binary fields in a generator
pattern. If you intend to match out the rest of the binary, use a match
expression instead of comprehension.

To learn more about comprehensions and generators, please refer to the [Reference Manual](`e:system:expressions#comprehensions`).
