# ERL-1247 - Typed literal string

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-export([t/1]).
t(<<"abc"/binary>>) -> ok.
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:3:5: a literal string in a binary pattern must not have a type or a size
%    3| t(<<"abc"/binary>>) -> ok.
%     |     ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1247` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This error is generated by the Erlang linter when it encounters a literal
string in a binary pattern with a type specifier other than `utf8`, `utf16`,
or `utf32`. When constructing a binary, a literal string is allowed to have
other types and sizes. This restriction only applies to binary matching.

To fix this error, remove the type or size from the literal string. If
they really need to have a specific type or size, you can use their integer
representation instead. `<<"abc">>` can be expressed as `<<97,98,99>>`.
Specifying a type or a size for `<<97,98,99>>` does not raise this error.

To learn more about the binary matching, please refer to the [Reference Manual](`e:system:bit_syntax#matching-binaries`).
