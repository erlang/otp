# ERL-0012 - Illegal string concatenation

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
t() -> "a""b".
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:2:11: adjacent string literals without intervening white space
%    2| t() -> "a""b".
%     |           ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-0012` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This error is generated by the Erlang scanner when it encounters illegal
string concatenation caused by adjacent string delimiters without proper
whitespace or separators between them.

In Erlang, strings can be concatenated by simply placing strings next to
each other separated by whitespace or other delimiters. For example, the
expression `"a" "b"` will be concatenated as `"ab"`. However, when string
delimiters are adjacent to each other without any whitespace or separator
like `"a""b"`, this is an illegal string concatenation.

To fix this error, add whitespaces between strings if they are meant to
be concatenated. Also ensure that escape sequences are used correctly.

For many cases, the scanner also raises a [ERL-0007: syntax error](ERL-0007-syntax-error.md)
in the meantime.

Erlang strings, please refer to the [Reference Manual](`e:system:data_types`).
