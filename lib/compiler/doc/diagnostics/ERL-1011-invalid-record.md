# ERL-1011 - Invalid record

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-record(r, {a}).
g() -> (no_record)#r{a=42}.
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:3:19: Warning: invalid record expression
%    3| g() -> (no_record)#r{a=42}.
%     |                   ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1011` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This error is generated by the Erlang linter when you try to access a record
with an expression that is not recognized as a valid record
type. When accessing or updating a record, the compiler verifies that the
`Expr` in `Expr#Name.Field` is a record of a valid type.

In the example above, `(no record)` is not a record. If the intention is
to create a record, `#r{a=42}` is sufficient. If the intention is to update
a record, the correct syntax is `Var#r{a=42}`, where `Var` is an existing
record.

To fix this error, ensure that the `Expr` in `Expr#Name.Field` is a record
of a valid type. If you are creating a record, use this syntax `#Name{Field1=Expr1, ..., FieldK=ExprK}`
without a prefix.
