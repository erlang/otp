## Explanation

This error message is generated by the Erlang scanner when it encounters
a badly-formatted triple-quoted string. The error text can either be "bad
indentation in triple-quoted string" or be "not white space after start
of triple-quoted string".

Triple-quoted string was introduced in OTP-27 according to [EEP-64: Triple-Quoted Strings](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0064).
The scanner rejects badly-formatted triple-quoted string if they violate
the following constraints.

- The opening `'''` must be followed immediately by a newline.
- The closing `'''` must be indented exactly as the opening `'''` was.

The example above has text `Bad format` immediately after the opening `'''`.
Deleting `Bad format` can fix the problem.

To fix this error, adhere to the EEP-64 formatting rules. The error message
is often self-explanatory for this error.
