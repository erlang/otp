# ERL-1076 - NIF not loaded

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-export([t/0]).
-nifs([t/0]).
t() -> a.
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:3:2: Warning: nifs defined, but no call to erlang:load_nif/2
%    3| -nifs([t/0]).
%     |  ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1076` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This warning is generated by the Erlang linter when a function is declared as
a Native Implemented Functions (NIF) using the `-nifs` attribute, but the
module does not have a call to `erlang:load_nif/2` that loads the native
library.

In Erlang, NIFs allow functions to be implemented in C and linked into the
emulator process for direct execution. The `-nifs` attribute marks functions
that should be replaced by their native counterparts when the module loads.

Without the call to `erlang:load_nif/2`, the VM will always use the Erlang
vertion of the NIF function, which is likely not intended.

To fix this warning, include a call to `erlang:load_nif/2` in the module that
the NIF library belongs to. Alternatively, if no calls to `erlang:load_nif/2`
is needed, simply disregard this warning.
