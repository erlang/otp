# ERL-1321 - Unused type

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-type a() :: integer().
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:2:2: Warning: type a() is unused
%    2| -type a() :: integer().
%     |  ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1321` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This warning is generated by the Erlang linter when a local type is not
used anywhere in the module. Exported types are not considered unused,
as they can be used by other modules. Local types can be used in type
specifications, function specifications, etc.

To fix this warning, first check spellings to avoid typos. If the type
is indeed unused, you can remove the type or find a new usage for it. If
the type might be useful as an exported type, you can export it.

Another possible reason for this warning is that the usage of this type
is rejected by the compiler and another error is raised, then this warning
will be raised at the same time. In this case, fixing the other error will fix this warning.

If it is intentional to have an unused type, add `nowarn_unused_type`
to the list of compile options to suppress this warning.

To learn more about types, please refer to the [Reference Manual](`e:system:typespec`).
