# ERL-1306 - Spec already defined

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-export([t/0]).
-spec t() -> ok.
-spec t() -> integer().
t() -> ok.
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:4:2: spec for t/0 already defined
%    4| -spec t() -> integer().
%     |  ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1306` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This error is generated by the Erlang linter when it sees more than one
specification for a function. Every function can have at most one `-spec` declaration. Functions with the same name but different
arities are not considered the same function. They can have separate
specifications.

To fix this error, remove the redundant specification, or use union types
for input or output parameters. If the output can be `ok` or `integer()`,
write it as a union type `ok | integer()`. It may happen that Erlang's
type syntax cannot express your intent precisely. That is a limitation
in Erlang's type language.

To learn more about function specifications, please refer to the
[Reference Manual](`e:system:typespec#specifications-for-functions`).
