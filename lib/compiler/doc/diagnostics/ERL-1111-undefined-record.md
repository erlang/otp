# ERL-1111 - Undefined record

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-export([t/0]).
t() -> #a{}.
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:3:8: record a undefined
%    3| t() -> #a{}.
%     |        ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1111` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This error is generated by the Erlang linter when you try to create, match,
or update a record that has not been defined in the module.

To fix this error, first ensure there is no typo in the record name. Check
that the record definition is before the usage. If the record is defined
in a shared header file, include it using the `-include` attribute.

To learn more about records, please refer to the [Reference Manual](`e:system:ref_man_records`).
