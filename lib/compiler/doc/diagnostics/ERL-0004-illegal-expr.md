## Example

% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-0004` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This error is generated by the Erlang scanner when it encounters an illegal
expression. This includes illegal atoms, variables, floats, characters,
or strings that do not conform to Erlang's requirements for data types.

This error can happen when the input contains:

- Atoms or variables that are too long or malformed.
- Floating point numbers that are syntactically invalid.
- Characters or Unicode code points that are invalid in Erlang.

For many cases, the scanner also raises a [ERL-0007: syntax error](ERL-0007-syntax-error.md)
in the meantime.

To fix this error, ensure that all atoms, variables, floats, and characters
conform to Erlang's requirements for data types. For more information about
Erlang data types, please refer to the [Reference Manual](`e:system:data_types`).
