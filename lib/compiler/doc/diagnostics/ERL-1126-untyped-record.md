# ERL-1126 - Untyped record field

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-export([t/0]).
-record(r, {a,b}).
-compile(warn_untyped_record).
t() -> #r{}.
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:3:2: Warning: record r has field(s) without type information
%    3| -record(r, {a,b}).
%     |  ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1126` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This warning is generated by the Erlang linter when the compile option
`warn_untyped_record` is enabled, and there is at least a field in a record
definition without type information. This compile option is not enabled
by default. However, adding type information can help
tools and programmers understand what the expected types are for each record
field.

To fix this warning, add type information to record fields like this:
`-record(r, {a :: integer()}).` Alternatively, if the warning is unwanted,
remove the compile option `warn_untyped_record` so that the compiler does
not raise this warning.
