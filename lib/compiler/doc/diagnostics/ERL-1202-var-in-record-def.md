# ERL-1202 - Variable in record definition

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-record(r2, {a = begin case foo of A -> A end,
                     A
                 end}).
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:2:36: variable 'A' in record definition
%    2| -record(r2, {a = begin case foo of A -> A end,
%     |                                    ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1202` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This error is generated by the Erlang linter when a record definition uses
a variable in the default value for a field. The default value for a field
can be an arbitrary expression, but it cannot use any variables. Record
definitions must be static.

To fix this error, replace the variables with compile-time constants in the
record definition. If you need dynamic values in record fields, assign them
when creating or updating the records.

To learn more about records, please refer to the [Reference Manual](`e:system:ref_man_records`).
