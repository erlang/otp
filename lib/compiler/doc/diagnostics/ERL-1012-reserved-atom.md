# ERL-1012 - Reserved atom

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-feature(maybe_expr, disable).
-compile(warn_keywords).
f() -> maybe.
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:4:8: Warning: atom ''maybe'' is reserved in the experimental feature 'maybe_expr'
%    4| f() -> maybe.
%     |        ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1012` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This error is generated by the Erlang linter when it encounters atoms that
will be reserved keywords in the future. Currently, no such keywords trigger
this error. The example above is generated by turning off `maybe` expressions,
which are included by default now.

To fix this error, avoid using the reserved atom mentioned in the error text.
