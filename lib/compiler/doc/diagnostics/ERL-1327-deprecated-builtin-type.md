# ERL-1327 - Deprecated built-in type

## Example

## Explanation

This warning is generated by the Erlang linter when a deprecated built-in
type is used. Currently, there is no type in the OTP codebase that will
raise this warning, so the example is missing.

To fix this warning, use the suggested type in the error text instead of
the deprecated type.
