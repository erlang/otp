# ERL-1031 - Exported removed function

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-removed([{t,0}]).
-export([t/0]).
t() -> ok.
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:2:2: removed function t/0 is still exported
%    2| -removed([{t,0}]).
%     |  ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1031` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This error is generated by the Erlang linter when at least one of the functions
in the removed attribute `-removed` is still listed in the module's `-export`
attribute. A removed funtcion should no longer be available for external use.
Exporting the function contradicts the intent of marking it as removed.

To fix this error, either delete the function from the `-removed` attribute to
indicate that the function is not removed, or delete the function from the
`-export` attribute to indicate that the function is no longer available for
external use.
