# ERL-1110 - Illegal map construction

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
t() -> #{ a := b}.
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:2:13: only association operators '=>' are allowed in map construction
%    2| t() -> #{ a := b}.
%     |             ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1110` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This error is generated by the Erlang linter when a `:=` is used in map
construction. `:=` is used either when updating an existing value in a map,
or when pattern-matching in a map. When constructing a new map, only `=>`
can be used to create new associations.

To fix this error, replace `:=` by `=>` if you intend to construct a new
map. If the intention is to update an existing map, and `:=` should be used
to update an existing value, make sure the name of the map is present, like
`Map#{K := V}`.

To learn more about map expressions, please refer to the [Reference Manual](`e:system:expressions#map-expressions`).
