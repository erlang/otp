# ERL-1200 - Unbound variable

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-export([t/0]).
t() -> X.
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:3:8: variable 'X' is unbound
%    3| t() -> X.
%     |        ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1200` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This error is generated by the Erlang linter when it encounters an unbound
variable that is not in a pattern. Variables are expressions that can be
bound to values using pattern-matching. In the example above, `X` is used
but it is never bound in a pattern. Therefore, the compiler raises this
error.

Because there are many ways to bind a variable, there are many ways to fix
this error. In the example above, `X` can be bound in the function head,
using a match expression, etc.. On the other hand, there are other possible
causes of this error: If the expression that binds this variable is rejected
by the Erlang linter and raises another error, this error will be raised at
the same time. In this case, fixing that expression is the way to fix this
error.

Usually, the scope for a variable is its function clause, but there are
special cases with variable scoping. If in doubt, always check the reference
manual about variable scoping rules.
