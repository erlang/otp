# ERL-1203 - Stacktrace variable in guard

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-export([t/0]).
t() ->
    try error(foo)
    catch _:_:Stk when is_number(Stk) -> ok
    end.
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:5:34: stacktrace variable 'Stk' must not be used in a guard
%    5|     catch _:_:Stk when is_number(Stk) -> ok
%     |                                  ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1203` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This error is generated by the Erlang linter when a stacktrace variable
is used in a guard. If a variable is bound to the stacktrace, the compiler
forbids certain operations to be done to it, mostly for the safety of the
VM. One of the restrictions is that the stacktrace variable cannot be used
in a guard.

To fix this error, rewrite the guard to a `case` in the clause body. The
stacktrace variable can be inspected and pattern-matched just as other
variables, as long as it is not in a guard.
