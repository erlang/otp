# ERL-1058 - Illegal zip generator

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
t() -> [X + Y || X <- [1,2,3,4] && Y <- [5,6,7] && X > 1].
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:2:54: only generators are allowed in a zip generator.
%    2| t() -> [X + Y || X <- [1,2,3,4] && Y <- [5,6,7] && X > 1].
%     |                                                      ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1058` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This error is generated by the Erlang linter when it encounters filters
or expressions other than generators in a zip generator. Only list generators,
binary generators, and map generators are allowed in a zip generator. Filters
and guards cannot be put inside a zip generator. They should be put after
a zip generator.

To fix this error, put the expression after the zip generator. This means
that `,` instead of `&&` should be used to seperate the zip generator and the expression.

To learn more about comprehensions and generators, please refer to the
[Reference Manual](`e:system:expressions#comprehensions`).
