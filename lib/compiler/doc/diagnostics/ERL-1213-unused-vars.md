# ERL-1213 - Unused variable

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-export([t/0]).
t() -> X = 3.
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:3:8: Warning: variable 'X' is unused
%    3| t() -> X = 3.
%     |        ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1213` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This error is generated by the Erlang linter when it sees that a variable
is bound but never used again in the same clause. In the example above,
`X` is bound to 3, but it is not used after it. The function can either
be simplified to never bind `X`, like `t() -> 3.`, or to return `X` after
binding it, like `t() -> X = 3, X.`

There are many ways to fix this warning. The easiest way is to add  `_`
to the beginning to the unused variable, like `_X`. This tells the compiler
to not generate this warning for the specific variable. Another solution
is to replace it with the anonymous variable `_` and ignore its value
completely.

If the expression that uses this variable is rejected by the Erlang linter
and raises another error, this error will be raised at the same time. In this
case, fixing the other expression is the way to fix this error.
