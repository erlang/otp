# ERL-1248 - Illegal size of unit for UTF

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-export([t/1]).
t(X) -> <<X:8/utf8>>.
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:3:11: neither size nor unit must be given for segments of type utf8/utf16/utf32
%    3| t(X) -> <<X:8/utf8>>.
%     |           ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1248` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This error is generated by the Erlang linter when you define a size or
unit for binary segments of type `utf8`, `utf16`, or `utf32`. For the
`utf8`, `utf16`, and `utf32` types, the size of the segment is implicitly
determined by the type and value. It is unnecessary and incorrect to manually
define a size. Unit is used to calculate the size of the segment in bits.
As size is implicitly defined already, it is not allowed to define a unit
for segments of these three types either.

To fix this error, remove the size and unit from segments of type `utf8`,
`utf16`, or `utf32`. If the segments should have size or unit, but not any
of these types, change the type accordingly, and keep the size or unit.

To learn more about the binary types, please refer to the [Reference Manual](`e:system:expressions#bit-syntax-expressions`).
