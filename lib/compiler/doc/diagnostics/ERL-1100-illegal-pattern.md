# ERL-1100 - Illegal pattern

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-export([t/1]).
t(A+B) -> ok.
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:3:4: illegal pattern
%    3| t(A+B) -> ok.
%     |    ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1100` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This error is generated by the Erlang linter when it sees an illegal pattern
in clause heads, case expressions, match expressions, etc.. A pattern should
have the same structure as a term, but it can contain unbound variables.

A common cause of this error is using arithmetic expressions that are not
allowed in patterns. If an arithmetic expression does not evaluate to a
constant, or if its operators are not numeric or bitwise, it is an illegal
pattern. In the example above, `A+B` is an illegal pattern because it cannot
be evaluated to a constant at compile time. For the same reason, `A+1` is
also an illegal pattern. `1+1` is a valid pattern.

Another common cause is to use `=>` in map patterns. Use `:=` in map patterns
instead.

A strategy to narrow down the illegal portion of a pattern is to replace
different parts of it with constants. The `^` in the error message also
gives hint about when the illegal part of the pattern starts.

[Reference Manual](`e:system:expressions#patterns`).
