# ERL-1211 - Underscore match

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-export([t/2]).
t(_X, _X) -> ok.
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:3:7: Warning: variable '_X' is bound multiple times in this pattern.
If you mean to ignore this value, use '_' or
a different underscore-prefixed name
%    3| t(_X, _X) -> ok.
%     |       ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1211` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This warning is generated by the Erlang linter when it sees a variable that
starts with underscore `_` is used in matching. The anonymous variable `_`
can match anything. However, a variable that starts with underscore `_`,
like `_X`, is normal and not anonymous. It can only be bound once. Using
it in a matching more than once is likely unintended.

If using it in pattern-matching is intended, and the multiple values it binds
to should be the same, remove the `_` from the variable to indicate that it
is a normal variable. If its value should be ignored, use `_` instead of
variables starting with `_`.

If this kind of warning should be suppressed, add `nowarn_underscore_match`
to the list of compile options.
