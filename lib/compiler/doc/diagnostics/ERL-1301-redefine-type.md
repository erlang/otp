# ERL-1301 - Type already defined

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-type a() :: integer().
-type a() :: integer().
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:3:2: type a() already defined
%    3| -type a() :: integer().
%     |  ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1301` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This error is generated by the Erlang linter when it sees a type with the
same name and arity being defined more than once. This is a module-wise
restriction. Types with the same name and arity can be defined across
different modules. Opaque types and nominal types follow the same rule as
regular types.

To fix this error, remove the redundant type definition. If the second
type definition should have a different arity than the first type definition,
change the arity can also fix the error.

To learn more about user-defined types, please refer to the [Reference Manual](`e:system:typespec#type-declarations-of-user-defined-types`).
