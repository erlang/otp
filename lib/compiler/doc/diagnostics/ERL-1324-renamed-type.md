# ERL-1324 - Renamed type

## Example


## Explanation

This warning is generated by the Erlang linter when a predefined type has
changed name, and the code uses the old name. Currently, there is no type
in the OTP codebase that will raise this warning, so the example is missing.

To fix this warning, use the suggested new name instead of the old name.
