# ERL-1071 - Function already exported

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-export([t/0]).
-export([t/0]).
t() -> a.
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:3:2: Warning: function t/0 already exported
%    3| -export([t/0]).
%     |  ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1071` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This warning is generated by the Erlang linter when it finds a function
that has been exported more than once. This does not cause a compilation
error, but exporting a function twice is unnecessary.

To fix this warning, remove the duplicated export function from the `-export`
list. Note that having multiple `-export` attributes does not raise warning,
as long as no function is repeated among the attribute lists.
