# ERL-1311 - Opaque not exported

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-opaque t() :: {a, atom()}.
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:2:2: Warning: opaque type t() is not exported
%    2| -opaque t() :: {a, atom()}.
%     |  ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1311` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This error is generated by the Erlang linter when an opaque type is not
exported by `-export_type`. An opaque type should have its structure hidden
outside of its defining module. If an opaque type is not exported, no other
module can use it. It does not make sense to make an opaque type local.
Opaque types always need to be exported.

To fix this error, export the opaque type using `-export_type` attribute.
For the example above, adding `-export_type([t/0]).` can fix the problem.
Alternatively, if the type does not need to be an opaque type, change
it to a regular type `-type` or a nominal type `-nominal`. It does not
have to be exported in these cases.
