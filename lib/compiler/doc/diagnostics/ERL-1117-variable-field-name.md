# ERL-1117 - Illegal field name

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-export([t/1]).
-record(r, {a,b}).
t(Var) -> #r{Var = 4}.
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:4:14: field 'Var' is not an atom or _ in record r
%    4| t(Var) -> #r{Var = 4}.
%     |              ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1117` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This error is generated by the Erlang linter when it sees a variable as
a field name in record creation, update, or pattern-matching. In Erlang,
record field name must be an atom or in updates and pattern-matchings,
the wildcard `_` to match all omitted fields.

To fix this error, change the illegal field name to either an atom to `_`.
If the intention is to compute the field name at runtime, record is not
a suitable data structure. Maps might be more useful in this case.

To learn more about records, please refer to the [Reference Manual](`e:system:ref_man_records`).
