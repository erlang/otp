# ERL-1204 - Stacktrace variable bounded

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-export([t/0]).
t() ->
    Stk = [],
    try error(foo)
    catch _:_:Stk -> ok
    end.
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:6:15: stacktrace variable 'Stk' must not be previously bound
%    6|     catch _:_:Stk -> ok
%     |               ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1204` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This error is generated by the Erlang linter when it encounters a stacktrace
variable that has been previously bound. If a variable is bound to the
stacktrace, the compiler forbids certain operations to be done to it, mostly
for the safety of the VM. One of the restrictions is that the stacktrace
variable cannot be previously bound.

To fix this error, do not bind the stacktrace variable before the `try...catch`.
You can use a new variable for the stacktrace, and do pattern-matching later.
