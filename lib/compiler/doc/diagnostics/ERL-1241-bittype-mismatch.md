# ERL-1241 - Bit type conflict

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-export([t/1]).
t(X) -> <<X/binary-integer>>.
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:3:11: conflict in type specification for bit field: 'integer' and 'binary'
%    3| t(X) -> <<X/binary-integer>>.
%     |           ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1241` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This error is generated by the Erlang linter when it sees a conflict in the
type specifier list of a bitstring/binary. The conflict can be in four areas:
type, sign, endianness, or unit. The error text usually points out which
parts of the specification has conflict.

To fix this error, check the requirements of the corresponding area. Some
types only allow for units in a certain range, for example. The type specifier
list for each segment of a bitstring/binary must not be ambiguous. In the
example above, `integer` and `binary` cannot both be the type of the
bitstring, thus it is a conflict.

To learn more about the type specifier list in a bitstring/binary, please
refer to the [Reference Manual](`e:system:expressions#bit-syntax-expressions`).
