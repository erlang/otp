# ERL-0003 - Unterminated expression

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
t1() -> "str.
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:2:10: unterminated string starting with "str."
%    2| t2() -> "str.
%     |          ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-0003` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This error message is generated by the Erlang scanner when it encounters
an unterminated expression that is not properly closed. Expressions here
could be atoms, strings, or character literals.

In Erlang, atoms, strings, and character literals must be properly terminated:

Atoms don't have to be quoted. If they are quoted, they need to be quoted
using single quotes, e.g., `'atom'`.


Strings need to be enclosed in double quotes, e.g., `"string"`.

Character literals start with `$` followed by a single character, e.g., `$a`.

If the closing quote or character is missing, the scanner detects an unterminated
expression and raises this error.

For example, `'qa` is missing the closing single quote, `"str` is missing
the closing double quote, and `$` alone is an incomplete character literal.

To fix this error, ensure all quoted atoms, strings, and character literals
are properly terminated. For example, adding the closing double quote can
fix the example above.

```erlang
t1() -> "str".
```
