# ERL-1246 - Illegal unsized binary

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-export([t/1]).
t(<<_/binary,I>>) -> I.
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:3:5: a binary field without size is only allowed at the end of a binary pattern
%    3| t(<<_/binary,I>>) -> I.
%     |     ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1246` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This error is generated by the Erlang linter when it sees a binary without
size before the end of a binary pattern. In binary matching, specifying
a binary field without size can match out the rest of a binary. However,
if it is not at the end of a binary pattern, it is unclear how much of
the binary should be matched out.

To fix this error, specify size for all binary fields not at the end of
a binary pattern. If the intention is to get the last `X` bits of a binary,
you need to implement a recursive call or use another trick to do that.

To learn more about the binary matching, please refer to the [Reference Manual](`e:system:bit_syntax#matching-binaries`).
