# ERL-1052 - Defining imported function

## Example

```erlang
%% foo.erl
-module(foo).
-import(ext,[t/1]).
t(X) -> X.
```

```
$ erlc foo.erl
foo.erl:3:1: defining imported function t/1
%    3| t(X) -> X.
%     | ^
% help: call `erlc -explain ERL-1052` to see a detailed explanation
```

## Explanation

This error is generated by the Erlang linter when a module both imports
a function from another module and also defines a function with the same
name and arity. Using `import(Module, Functions)` means that calls to the
specified functions will refer to the imported definition. Defining your
own functions with the same name and arity is not allowed in this case.

To fix this error, either remove the function from the imported function
list, or change the name or arity of the local function to avoid ambiguity.
