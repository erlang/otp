	    Fix <c>get_map_elements</c> register corruption</p>
          <p>
	    Instruction <c>get_map_elements</c> might destroy target
	    registers when the fail-label is taken. Only seen for
	    patterns with two, and only two, target registers.
	    Specifically if we copy one register and then jump.</p>

	    The compiler optimizes away building of terms that are
	    never actually used. As a result, the compiler in OTP 18
	    may produce more warnings for terms that are built but
	    not used than the compiler in OTP 17.</p>

	    The compiler now properly reports unknown parse
	    transforms. That is, <c>undef</c> exceptions coming from
	    the parse transform itself is reported differently from
	    the absence of the parse transform.</p>

	    Matching out a map from a record and then updating the
	    record could cause a 'badarg' exception at run-time.

	    <p>The compiler would crash when compiling some complex,

	    In rare circumstances, using binary pattern in the value
	    part of a map pattern would cause the compiler to crash.</p>

        </item>
        <item>
	    <p>Case expressions where a map was wrapped in a tuple or
	    list such as:</p>
	    <p><c>case {a,Map} of</c><br/> <c>{a,#{k:=_}}=Tuple -&gt;
	    Tuple</c><br/> <c>end.</c></p>
	    <p>would be unsafely "optimized" to either cause an
	    exception at run-time or would return an empty map.</p>

	    Own Id: OTP-12451</p>
        </item>
        <item>
	    <p>When a variable was compared to a literal map using
	    the '<c>==</c>' operator, the compiler would change the
	    operator to '<c>=:=</c>' since it is more efficient.
	    However, this optimization is not safe if the map literal
	    has numeric keys or values. The compiler will now only do
	    the optimization if all keys and values are
	    non-numeric.</p>

	    The compiler now properly annotates the code in value in

	    With <c>--Wunmatched_returns</c>, dialyzer will no longer
	    warn when the value of a list comprehension is ignored,
	    provided that the each value in the list would be an
	    atomic value (such as integer or atoms, as opposed to
	    tuples and lists). Example: ignoring '<c>[io:format(...)
	    || ...]</c>' will not cause a warning, while ignoring
	    '<c>[file:close(Fd) || ...]</c>' will.</p>

	    Allow all auto imports to be suppressed at once.
	    Introducing the no_auto_import attribute:
	    -compile(no_auto_import). Useful for code generation
	    tools that always use the qualified function names and
	    want to avoid the auto imported functions clashing with
	    local ones. (Thanks to Jos√© Valim.)</p>

	    The default encoding for Erlang source files is now
	    UTF-8. As a temporary measure to ease the transition from
	    the old default of latin-1, if the compiler encounters
	    byte sequences that are not valid UTF-8 sequences, the
	    compiler will re-try the compilation in latin-1 mode.
	    This workaround will be removed in a future release.</p>

	    returns a list of its callbacks.</p>
          <p>
	    This function is now automatically generated using the
	    '-callback' specs. An error is returned by lint if user
	    defines both '-callback' attributes and the
	    behaviour_info/1 function. If no type info is needed for
	    a callback use a generic spec for it. Add '-callback'
	    attribute to language syntax</p>
          <p>
	    Behaviours may define specs for their callbacks using the
	    familiar spec syntax, replacing the '-spec' keyword with
	    '-callback'. Simple lint checks are performed to ensure
	    that no callbacks are defined twice and all types
	    referred are declared.</p>
          <p>
	    These attributes can be then used by tools to provide
	    documentation to the behaviour or find discrepancies in
	    the callback definitions in the callback module.</p>

	    <p>Long sequences of list comprehensions without
	    generators joined by the '++' operator would cause a code
	    expansion explosion, which could cause the compiler to
	    run out of memory. To resolve this problem, in
	    '<c>[...||...]++Expr</c>', <c>Expr</c> is now evaluated
	    before the list comprehension. This change <em>is</em>
	    backwards compatible (see the following note about
	    evaluation order if you have doubts).</p>
	    <p>Note about evaluation order: The Reference manual says
	    that subexpressions are evaluated <em>in any order</em>
	    before the expression itself. Therefore, in an expression
	    such as '<c>LeftExpr++RightExpr</c>', you should not
	    depend on <c>LeftExpr</c> being evaluated before
	    <c>RightExpr</c> or vice versa. The evaluation order is
	    only important if the expressions contains and/or depends
	    on operations with side-effects, such as message passing
	    or <c>ets</c> operations.</p>

	    <p>Literal lists, tuples, and binaries are no longer

	    <p>This is not a change to the language, only in the
	    details of its implementation. Therefore, the
	    implications of this change is described in the
	    Efficiency Guide.</p>
	    <p>Example 1: In the expression <c>element(BitNum-1,
	    {1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128})</c>, the tuple used to be
	    constructed every time the expression was executed, which
	    could be detrimental to performance in two ways if the
	    expression was executed in a loop: the time to build the
	    tuple itself and the time spent in garbage collections
	    because the heap filled up with garbage faster.</p>
	    <p>Example 2: Literal strings, such as <c>"abc"</c>, used
	    to be stored in the compiled code compactly as a byte
	    string and expanded to a list at run-time. Now all
	    strings will be stored expanded to lists (such as
	    <c>[$a,$b,$c]</c>) in the constant pool. That means that
	    the string will be faster to use at run-time, but that it
	    will require more space even when not used. If space is
	    an issue, you might want to use binary literals (that is,
	    <c>&lt;&lt;"abc"&lt;&lt;</c>) instead of string literals for
	    infrequently used long strings (such as error
	    messages).</p>

          <p>The compiler now runs a validation pass on the
            generated code and aborts before writing a Beam file if
            any suspect code is found. In particular, the validation
            pass checks for incorrect code that may cause emulator
            crashes or other strange symptoms in the emulator.</p>

          <p>Corrected the release note regarding <c><![CDATA[try/catch]]></c> below.
            <c><![CDATA[try/catch]]></c> DOES work in the initial R10B release.</p>
          <p>A few minor issues code generation issues were corrected.
            Although the generated code was correct, it was slightly
            slower and larger than it needed to be.</p>
          <p>A debug printout (that could be seen in rare
            circumstances) has been removed.</p>
          <p><c><![CDATA[not record_test(not_a_tuple, RecordTag)]]></c> and
            similar expressions in a guard would fail.</p>
          <p>New options <c><![CDATA[basic_validation]]></c> and
            <c><![CDATA[strong_validation]]></c> to do a quick check of the code
            of a module.</p>
          <p>The <c><![CDATA[inline]]></c> option was not recognized if it
            appeared in a <c><![CDATA[-compile()]]></c> directive inside the
            module.</p>
          <p>Corrected some bugs in the undocumented feature
            "parameterized modules".</p>

          <p>When the undocumented feature "parameterized modules" was
            used, the <c><![CDATA[?MODULE]]></c> macro did not work correctly.</p>
