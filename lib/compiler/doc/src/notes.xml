	    A literal binary matching regression was introduced in
	    19.0 where a match could fail to resolve to the right
	    clause. This has now been fixed.</p>

	    are: <c>get_anno/{1,2}</c>, <c>is_literal/1</c>,
	    <c>is_literal_list/1</c>, and <c>literal_value</c>. Use

	    <p>The compiler will no longer put the compilation date
	    and time into BEAM files. That means that two BEAM files
	    compiled on the same computer from the same source code
	    and compilation options will be identical.</p>
	    <p>Note: If you want to find out whether a BEAM file on
	    disk is different from the loaded code, compared the MD5
	    value obtained from <c>Mod:module_info(md5)</c> with the
	    MD5 value obtained from
	    <c>beam_lib:md5(BeamFileForMod)</c></p>.

	    <p>When a variable was compared to a literal map using

	    operator to '<c>=:=</c>' since it is more efficient.
	    However, this optimization is not safe if the map literal
	    has numeric keys or values. The compiler will now only do
	    the optimization if all keys and values are
	    non-numeric.</p>

		<p>
	    For information on how to use Maps please see Map Expressions in the

	    The default encoding for Erlang source files is now
	    UTF-8. As a temporary measure to ease the transition from
	    the old default of latin-1, if the compiler encounters
	    byte sequences that are not valid UTF-8 sequences, the
	    compiler will re-try the compilation in latin-1 mode.
	    This workaround will be removed in a future release.</p>

          <p>
	    This function is now automatically generated using the

	    defines both '-callback' attributes and the
	    behaviour_info/1 function. If no type info is needed for
	    a callback use a generic spec for it. Add '-callback'
	    attribute to language syntax</p>
          <p>
	    Behaviours may define specs for their callbacks using the
	    familiar spec syntax, replacing the '-spec' keyword with
	    '-callback'. Simple lint checks are performed to ensure
	    that no callbacks are defined twice and all types

	    the guard. For certain guards, far too many x registers
	    were saved and subsequently restored. In this version of

	    <p>Long sequences of list comprehensions without

	    expansion explosion, which could cause the compiler to
	    run out of memory. To resolve this problem, in
	    '<c>[...||...]++Expr</c>', <c>Expr</c> is now evaluated
	    before the list comprehension. This change <em>is</em>
	    backwards compatible (see the following note about
	    evaluation order if you have doubts).</p>
	    <p>Note about evaluation order: The Reference manual says
	    that subexpressions are evaluated <em>in any order</em>
	    before the expression itself. Therefore, in an expression
	    such as '<c>LeftExpr++RightExpr</c>', you should not
	    depend on <c>LeftExpr</c> being evaluated before
	    <c>RightExpr</c> or vice versa. The evaluation order is
	    only important if the expressions contains and/or depends
	    on operations with side-effects, such as message passing
	    or <c>ets</c> operations.</p>

	    <p>This is not a change to the language, only in the
	    details of its implementation. Therefore, the
	    implications of this change is described in the
	    Efficiency Guide.</p>
	    <p>Example 1: In the expression <c>element(BitNum-1,
	    {1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128})</c>, the tuple used to be
	    constructed every time the expression was executed, which
	    could be detrimental to performance in two ways if the
	    expression was executed in a loop: the time to build the
	    tuple itself and the time spent in garbage collections
	    because the heap filled up with garbage faster.</p>
	    <p>Example 2: Literal strings, such as <c>"abc"</c>, used
	    to be stored in the compiled code compactly as a byte
	    string and expanded to a list at run-time. Now all
	    strings will be stored expanded to lists (such as
	    <c>[$a,$b,$c]</c>) in the constant pool. That means that
	    the string will be faster to use at run-time, but that it
	    will require more space even when not used. If space is
	    an issue, you might want to use binary literals (that is,
	    <c>&lt;&lt;"abc"&lt;&lt;</c>) instead of string literals for
	    infrequently used long strings (such as error

          <p>In rare circumstances, incorrect code for record or
            tuple access could be generated. The incorrect code would
            either trigger an internal error in the compiler or cause
            an exception at run time. (Thanks to Martin Bjorklund.)</p>
          <p>Corrected a bug in in bit syntax matching where
            clauses could match in the wrong order. (Thanks to Ulf
            Wiger.)</p>

          <p>Given bit syntax construction in certain complex
            contexts involving a catch, the compiler would either
            crash or terminate due to failure in an internal
            consistency check. (Thanks to Fredrik Thulin.)</p>
          <p>Matches such as
            <c><![CDATA[<<103133:64/float>> = <<103133:64/float>>]]></c>
            used to fail. Now they succeed.</p>
          <p>Shadowing of variables in bit syntax matches in fun heads
            such as in
            <c><![CDATA[L = 8, F = fun(<<L:L,B:L>>) -> B end]]></c> was
            handled incorrectly by the compiler. The fun used to be
            compiled as if it was written
            '<c><![CDATA[>fun(<<8:8,B:8>>)]]></c>, while it should be
            compiled in the same way as <c><![CDATA[fun(<<L:8,B:L>>)]]></c>.</p>
          <p>A bug in the validation pass has been corrected. It
            sometimes occurred when the compiler optimized by reusing
            code for causing an exception when the reused code was
            called from within catch or try-catch statements. Then the
            validator refused to approve the code and complained about
            <c><![CDATA[fun(<<L:L,B:L>>) -> B end]]></c> was handled
            incorrectly by the in the same way as
            <c><![CDATA[fun(<<L:8,B:L>>)]]></c>.</p>
          <p>A bug in the unknown_catch_try_state.</p>
          <p>Corrected a bug in the optimizer that would cause
            the compiler to crash. (Thanks to Peter-Henry Mander.)</p>
          <p>There are now warnings generated if a bit syntax
            construction will fail at run-time because of a type
            mismatch (e.g. <c><![CDATA[<<an_atom:8>>]]></c>).</p>

          <p>Binary pattern matching such as
            <c><![CDATA[t(<<A:8>> = <<A:8>)]]></c> used to silently
            fail at runtime (i.e. never match). The compiler now
            generates an error for any such patterns.</p>

          <p>In rare cases, the code compiler code generate code
            for a tuple match that could crash the emulator if passed
            a term that was not a tuple.</p>
          <p>If a bit syntax construction failed within a catch,
            previously assigned variables could get the wrong value.</p>
          <p>The compiler now runs a validation pass on the
            generated code and aborts before writing a Beam file if
            any suspect code is found. In particular, the validation
            pass checks for incorrect code that may cause emulator
            crashes or other strange symptoms in the emulator.</p>
          <p>Some corrections to the unsupported feature
            parameterized modules by Richard Carlsson (HiPE).</p>

          <p>Corrected the release note regarding <c><![CDATA[try/catch]]></c> below.
            <c><![CDATA[try/catch]]></c> DOES work in the initial R10B release.</p>
          <p>A few minor issues code generation issues were corrected.
            Although the generated code was correct, it was slightly
            slower and larger than it needed to be.</p>
          <p>A debug printout (that could be seen in rare
            circumstances) has been removed.</p>
          <p><c><![CDATA[not record_test(not_a_tuple, RecordTag)]]></c> and
            similar expressions in a guard would fail.</p>
          <p>New options <c><![CDATA[basic_validation]]></c> and
            <c><![CDATA[strong_validation]]></c> to do a quick check of the code
            of a module.</p>
          <p>The <c><![CDATA[inline]]></c> option was not recognized if it
            appeared in a <c><![CDATA[-compile()]]></c> directive inside the
            module.</p>
          <p>Corrected some bugs in the undocumented feature
            "parameterized modules".</p>

          <p>When the undocumented feature "parameterized modules" was
            used, the <c><![CDATA[?MODULE]]></c> macro did not work correctly.</p>
