	    <p><c>record_info/2</c> is a pseudo-function that
	    requires literal arguments known at compile time.
	    Therefore, the following usage is illegal: <c>fun
	    record/info/2</c>. The compiler would crash when during
	    compilation of that kind of code. Corrected to issue a
	    compilation error.</p>

    <section><title>Improvements and New Features</title>
      <list>
        <item>
          <p>
	    The compiler has been rewritten to internally use an
	    intermediate representation based on Static Single
	    Assignment (SSA). The new intermediate representation
	    makes more optimizations possible.</p>
          <p>
	    Most noticeable is that the binary matching optimizations
	    are now applicable in many more circumstances than
	    before.</p>
          <p>
	    Another noticeable change is that type optimizations are
	    now applied across local function calls, and will remove
	    a lot more redundant type tests than before.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-14894 Aux Id: ERL-714 </p>
        </item>
        <item>
	    <p>Funs are no longer created when they are only used
	    locally, greatly improving the performance of named funs
	    and "fun-wrapped" macros.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-15273 Aux Id: ERL-639 </p>
        </item>
        <item>
	    <p>All compiler options that can be given in the source
	    file can now also be given in the option list or from the
	    command line for <c>erlc</c>.</p>
	    <p>Specifically, the option
	    <c>{nowarn_deprecated_function,MFAs}</c> was only
	    recognized when given in the file with the attribute
	    <c>-compile()</c>. The option
	    <c>{nowarn_unused_function,FAs}</c> was incorrectly
	    documented to only work in a file, but it also worked
	    when given in the option list.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-15456</p>

	    residing in other modules. </p>

        </item>
        <item>
	    <p>Internal documentation has now been added to the
	    <em>Erts</em> and <em>Compiler</em> applications.</p>
	    <p>The internal documents for <em>Erts</em> describe
	    miscellaneous interesting implementation details. Those
	    details can change at any time.</p>
	    <p>The internal documentation for <em>Compiler</em>
	    documents the API for the Core Erlang modules. While we
	    will not change those APIs without good reason, we don't
	    give the same guarantees about backward compatibility as
	    for the rest of the APIs in OTP.</p>

	    Own Id: OTP-15715</p>
        </item>
        <item>
	    <p> There are new compiler options <c>nowarn_removed</c>
	    and <c>{nowarn_removed,Items}</c> to suppress warnings
	    for functions and modules that have been removed from
	    OTP.</p>

	    <p>There could be an incorrect warning when the
	    <c>tuple_calls</c> option was given. The generated code
	    would be correct. Here is an example of code that would

	    <p>An optimization that avoided allocation of a stack
	    frame for some <c>case</c> expressions was introduced in
	    OTP 21. (ERL-504/OTP-14808) It turns out that in rare
	    circumstances, this optimization is not safe. Therefore,
	    this optimization has been disabled.</p>
	    <p>A similar optimization will be included in OTP 22 in a
	    safe way.</p>

	    <p>Support for "tuple calls" have been removed from the

	    The default encoding for Erlang source files is now

	    the old default of latin-1, if the compiler encounters
	    byte sequences that are not valid UTF-8 sequences, the
	    compiler will re-try the compilation in latin-1 mode.
	    This workaround will be removed in a future release.</p>

	    absence of a compile_info chunk in a .beam file. This
	    clashed with the type declaration of the compile_info
	    field of a #beam_file{} record as containing a list. Now
	    [] signifies the absence of this chunk. This simplifies
	    the code and avoids a dialyzer warning.</p>

	    Add '-callback' attributes in stdlib's behaviours</p>
          <p>
	    Replace the behaviour_info(callbacks) export in stdlib's
	    behaviours with -callback' attributes for all the
	    callbacks. Update the documentation with information on
	    the callback attribute Automatically generate
	    'behaviour_info' function from '-callback' attributes</p>
          <p>
	    'behaviour_info(callbacks)' is a special function that is
	    defined in a module which describes a behaviour and
	    returns a list of its callbacks.</p>
          <p>
	    This function is now automatically generated using the
	    '-callback' specs. An error is returned by lint if user
	    defines both '-callback' attributes and the
	    behaviour_info/1 function. If no type info is needed for
	    a callback use a generic spec for it. Add '-callback'
	    attribute to language syntax</p>
          <p>
	    Behaviours may define specs for their callbacks using the
	    familiar spec syntax, replacing the '-spec' keyword with
	    '-callback'. Simple lint checks are performed to ensure
	    that no callbacks are defined twice and all types
	    referred are declared.</p>
          <p>
	    These attributes can be then used by tools to provide
	    documentation to the behaviour or find discrepancies in
	    the callback definitions in the callback module.</p>
          <p>
	    Add callback specs into 'application' module in kernel
	    Add callback specs to tftp module following internet
	    documentation Add callback specs to inets_service module

	    <p>Long sequences of list comprehensions without

	    before the list comprehension. This change <em>is</em>
	    backwards compatible (see the following note about
	    evaluation order if you have doubts).</p>
	    <p>Note about evaluation order: The Reference manual says
	    that subexpressions are evaluated <em>in any order</em>
	    before the expression itself. Therefore, in an expression
	    such as '<c>LeftExpr++RightExpr</c>', you should not
	    depend on <c>LeftExpr</c> being evaluated before
	    <c>RightExpr</c> or vice versa. The evaluation order is
	    only important if the expressions contains and/or depends
	    on operations with side-effects, such as message passing
	    or ETS operations.</p>

	    <c>[$a,$b,$c]</c>) in the constant pool. That means that
	    the string will be faster to use at run-time, but that it
	    will require more space even when not used. If space is
	    an issue, you might want to use binary literals (that is,

          <p>It is now possible to encrypt the debug information in
            Beam files, to help keep the source code secret. See the
            documentation for <c><![CDATA[compile]]></c> on how to provide the key
            for encrypting, and the documentation for <c><![CDATA[beam_lib]]></c>
            on how to provide the key for decryption so that tools such
            as the Debugger, Xref, or Cover can be used.</p>
          <p>The <c><![CDATA[beam_lib:chunks/2]]></c> functions now accepts an
            additional chunk type <c><![CDATA[compile_info]]></c> to retrieve
            the compilation information directly as a term. (Thanks
            to Tobias Lindahl.)</p>

          <p>Given bit syntax construction in certain complex
            contexts involving a catch, the compiler would either
            crash or terminate due to failure in an internal
            consistency check. (Thanks to Fredrik Thulin.)</p>
          <p>Matches such as
            <c><![CDATA[<<103133:64/float>> = <<103133:64/float>>]]></c>
            used to fail. Now they succeed.</p>
          <p>Shadowing of variables in bit syntax matches in fun heads
            such as in
            <c><![CDATA[L = 8, F = fun(<<L:L,B:L>>) -> B end]]></c> was
            handled incorrectly by the compiler. The fun used to be
            compiled as if it was written
            '<c><![CDATA[>fun(<<8:8,B:8>>)]]></c>, while it should be
            compiled in the same way as <c><![CDATA[fun(<<L:8,B:L>>)]]></c>.</p>
          <p>A bug in the validation pass has been corrected. It
            sometimes occurred when the compiler optimized by reusing
            code for causing an exception when the reused code was
            called from within catch or try-catch statements. Then the
            validator refused to approve the code and complained about
            <c><![CDATA[fun(<<L:L,B:L>>) -> B end]]></c> was handled
            incorrectly by the in the same way as
            <c><![CDATA[fun(<<L:8,B:L>>)]]></c>.</p>
          <p>A bug in the unknown_catch_try_state.</p>
          <p>Corrected a bug in the optimizer that would cause
            the compiler to crash. (Thanks to Peter-Henry Mander.)</p>
          <p>There are now warnings generated if a bit syntax
            construction will fail at run-time because of a type
            mismatch (e.g. <c><![CDATA[<<an_atom:8>>]]></c>).</p>

            fail at runtime (i.e. never match). The compiler now
            generates an error for any such patterns.</p>

          <p>In rare cases, the code compiler code generate code
            for a tuple match that could crash the emulator if passed
            a term that was not a tuple.</p>
          <p>If a bit syntax construction failed within a catch,
            previously assigned variables could get the wrong value.</p>
          <p>The compiler now runs a validation pass on the
            generated code and aborts before writing a Beam file if
            any suspect code is found. In particular, the validation
            pass checks for incorrect code that may cause emulator
            crashes or other strange symptoms in the emulator.</p>
