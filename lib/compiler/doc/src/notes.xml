	    <p>The compiler would silently accept singleton (unbound)
	    type variables in a union type. Starting from Erlang/OTP
	    26, the compiler will generate a warning for this
	    example. The warning can be disabled using the
	    <c>nowarn_singleton_typevar</c> option. In Erlang/OTP 27,
	    the warning will become an error.</p>

	    <p>It is documented that <c>$\^X</c> is the ASCII code
	    for Control X, where X is an uppercase or lowercase
	    letter. However, this notation would work for any
	    character X, even then it didn't make sense.</p>
	    <p>In Erlang/OTP 26, it is now documented that the
	    following characters are also allowed to follow the
	    <c>\^</c> characters: <c>@</c>, <c>[</c>, <c>\</c>,
	    <c>]</c>, <c>^</c>, <c>_</c>, and <c>?</c>. Attempt to
	    use other characters will be rejected with a compiler
	    error.</p>
	    <p>The value for <c>$\^?</c> is now 127 (instead of 31 as

	    <p>A subtle bug regarding variable scoping has been
	    corrected. Consider this example:</p>
	    <p><c>(A=1) + fun() -&gt; A = 2() end</c></p>
	    <p>In the shell, the expression correctly evaluates to
	    <c>3</c>. In compiled code, it raised a <c>{badmatch,
	    2}</c> exception.</p>

	    <p>Fixed a rare bug that would crash the compiler during
	    type optimization.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-17820</p>
        </item>
        <item>
	    <p>Starting in OTP 24, when a fun was created and
	    immediately used, it would be inlined. An unintended
	    consequence of the inlining was that what would be a
	    <c>function_clause</c> exception without the inlining
	    would now be a rather confusing <c>case_clause</c>
	    exception. This has been corrected, so that
	    <c>function_clause</c> exceptions remain
	    <c>function_clause</c> exceptions in inlined code.</p>

          <p>
	    If a default record field initialization (<c>_ =
	    Expr</c>) was used even though all records fields were
	    explicitly initialized, <c>Expr</c> would not be
	    evaluated. That would not be a problem, except when
	    <c>Expr</c> would bind a variable subsequently used, in
	    which case the compiler would crash.</p>
          <p>
	    As an example, if record <c>#r{}</c> is defined to have
	    only one field <c>a</c>, the following code would crash
	    the compiler:</p>
          <p>
	    <c>#r{a=[],_=V=42}, V</c></p>
          <p>
	    To fix that problem, the compiler will make sure that
	    <c>Expr</c> is always evaluated at least once. The
	    compiler will now rewrite the example to essentially:</p>
          <p>
	    <c>V=42, #r{a=[]}, V</c></p>

	    <p>Several minor compiler bugs have been fixed:</p>
	    <p>Constructing a binary with a list as a size of a
	    binary segment could generate a BEAM file that could not
	    be loaded.</p>
	    <p>When matching a binary segment of type <c>float</c>
	    and ignoring the matched out value, the match would
	    always succeed, even if the size was invalid or the value
	    of the float was NaN or some other non-numeric float
	    value.</p>
	    <p>Attempting to construct an invalid external fun (e.g.
	    <c>fun m:f:bad</c>) is supposed to raise a
	    '<c>badarg</c>' exception, but if the value was never
	    used, no exception would be raised.</p>

	    The compiler has been rewritten to internally use an
	    intermediate representation based on Static Single
	    Assignment (SSA). The new intermediate representation
	    makes more optimizations possible.</p>
          <p>
	    Most noticeable is that the binary matching optimizations
	    are now applicable in many more circumstances than
	    before.</p>
          <p>
	    Another noticeable change is that type optimizations are
	    now applied across local function calls, and will remove
	    a lot more redundant type tests than before.</p>

	    <p>Support for "tuple calls" have been removed from the
	    run-time system. Tuple calls was an undocumented and
	    unsupported feature which allowed the module argument for
	    an apply operation to be a tuple: <c>Var = dict:new(),
	    Var:size()</c>. This "feature" frequently caused
	    confusion, especially when such call failed. The
	    stacktrace would point out functions that don't exist in
	    the source code.</p>
	    <p>For legacy code that need to use parameterized modules
	    or tuple calls for some other reason, there is a new
	    compiler option called <c>tuple_calls</c>. When this
	    option is given, the compiler will generate extra code
	    that emulates the old behavior for calls where the module
	    is a variable.</p>

	    <p>Loaded BEAM code in a 64-bit system requires less
	    memory because of better packing of operands for
	    instructions.</p>
	    <p>These memory savings were achieved by major
	    improvements to the <c>beam_makeops</c> scripts used when
	    building the run time system and BEAM compiler. There is
	    also new for documentation for <c>beam_makeops</c> that
	    describes how new BEAM instructions and loader
	    transformations can be implemented. The documentation is
	    found in here in a source directory or git repository:
	    erts/emulator/internal_doc/beam_makeops.md. An online
	    version can be found here:

	    <p>When the value returned from a '<c>catch</c>'

	    The compiler now properly annotates the code in value in
	    the '<c>after</c>' clause for a '<c>try</c>' so that
	    Dialyzer no longer generates a false warning for an
	    unmatched return.</p>

	    With <c>--Wunmatched_returns</c>, dialyzer will no longer
	    warn when the value of a list comprehension is ignored,
	    provided that the each value in the list would be an
	    atomic value (such as integer or atoms, as opposed to
	    tuples and lists). Example: ignoring '<c>[io:format(...)
	    || ...]</c>' will not cause a warning, while ignoring
	    '<c>[file:close(Fd) || ...]</c>' will.</p>

	    Allow all auto imports to be suppressed at once.
	    Introducing the no_auto_import attribute:

	    local ones. (Thanks to José Valim.)</p>

	    EEP43: New data type - Maps</p>

            <tag/><item><c>#{ "hi" := V1, a := V2, b := V3} = M2.
               % match keys with values</c></item>
          </taglist>
		<p>
	    For information on how to use Maps please see Map Expressions in the

	    The default encoding for Erlang source files is now
	    UTF-8. As a temporary measure to ease the transition from
	    the old default of latin-1, if the compiler encounters
	    byte sequences that are not valid UTF-8 sequences, the
	    compiler will re-try the compilation in latin-1 mode.
	    This workaround will be removed in a future release.</p>

	    Fixed a discrepancy in compile_info</p>
          <p>
	    The BEAM disassembler used the atom 'none' to signify the
	    absence of a compile_info chunk in a .beam file. This
	    clashed with the type declaration of the compile_info
	    field of a #beam_file{} record as containing a list. Now
	    [] signifies the absence of this chunk. This simplifies
	    the code and avoids a dialyzer warning.</p>

	    Add '-callback' attributes in stdlib's behaviours</p>
          <p>
	    Replace the behaviour_info(callbacks) export in stdlib's
	    behaviours with -callback' attributes for all the
	    callbacks. Update the documentation with information on
	    the callback attribute Automatically generate
	    'behaviour_info' function from '-callback' attributes</p>
          <p>
	    'behaviour_info(callbacks)' is a special function that is
	    defined in a module which describes a behaviour and
	    returns a list of its callbacks.</p>
          <p>
	    This function is now automatically generated using the
	    '-callback' specs. An error is returned by lint if user
	    defines both '-callback' attributes and the
	    behaviour_info/1 function. If no type info is needed for
	    a callback use a generic spec for it. Add '-callback'
	    attribute to language syntax</p>
          <p>
	    Behaviours may define specs for their callbacks using the
	    familiar spec syntax, replacing the '-spec' keyword with
	    '-callback'. Simple lint checks are performed to ensure
	    that no callbacks are defined twice and all types
	    referred are declared.</p>
          <p>
	    These attributes can be then used by tools to provide
	    documentation to the behaviour or find discrepancies in
	    the callback definitions in the callback module.</p>
          <p>
	    Add callback specs into 'application' module in kernel
	    Add callback specs to tftp module following internet
	    documentation Add callback specs to inets_service module

	    <p>Long sequences of list comprehensions without

	    expansion explosion, which could cause the compiler to
	    run out of memory. To resolve this problem, in
	    '<c>[...||...]++Expr</c>', <c>Expr</c> is now evaluated
	    before the list comprehension. This change <em>is</em>
	    backwards compatible (see the following note about
	    evaluation order if you have doubts).</p>
	    <p>Note about evaluation order: The Reference manual says
	    that subexpressions are evaluated <em>in any order</em>
	    before the expression itself. Therefore, in an expression
	    such as '<c>LeftExpr++RightExpr</c>', you should not
	    depend on <c>LeftExpr</c> being evaluated before
	    <c>RightExpr</c> or vice versa. The evaluation order is
	    only important if the expressions contains and/or depends
	    on operations with side-effects, such as message passing
	    or ETS operations.</p>

	    <p>Literal lists, tuples, and binaries are no longer
	    constructed at run-time as they used to be, but are
	    stored in a per-module constant pool. Literals that are
	    used more than once are stored only once.</p>
	    <p>This is not a change to the language, only in the
	    details of its implementation. Therefore, the
	    implications of this change is described in the
	    Efficiency Guide.</p>
	    <p>Example 1: In the expression <c>element(BitNum-1,
	    {1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128})</c>, the tuple used to be
	    constructed every time the expression was executed, which
	    could be detrimental to performance in two ways if the
	    expression was executed in a loop: the time to build the
	    tuple itself and the time spent in garbage collections
	    because the heap filled up with garbage faster.</p>
	    <p>Example 2: Literal strings, such as <c>"abc"</c>, used
	    to be stored in the compiled code compactly as a byte
	    string and expanded to a list at run-time. Now all
	    strings will be stored expanded to lists (such as
	    <c>[$a,$b,$c]</c>) in the constant pool. That means that
	    the string will be faster to use at run-time, but that it
	    will require more space even when not used. If space is
	    an issue, you might want to use binary literals (that is,
	    <c>&lt;&lt;"abc"&lt;&lt;</c>) instead of string literals for
	    infrequently used long strings (such as error
	    messages).</p>

	    <c>size/1</c> BIF will be removed no earlier than in
	    R14B.) The BIFs are <c>tuple_size/1</c> to calculate the
	    size of a tuple and <c>byte_size/1</c> to calculate the
	    number of bytes needed for the contents of the binary or
	    bitstring (rounded up to the nearest number of bytes if

          <p>The new type test <c><![CDATA[is_function(Fun, A)]]></c> (which may be

          <p>It is now possible to encrypt the debug information in
            Beam files, to help keep the source code secret. See the
            documentation for <c><![CDATA[compile]]></c> on how to provide the key
            for encrypting, and the documentation for <c><![CDATA[beam_lib]]></c>
            on how to provide the key for decryption so that tools such
            as the Debugger, Xref, or Cover can be used.</p>
          <p>The <c><![CDATA[beam_lib:chunks/2]]></c> functions now accepts an
            additional chunk type <c><![CDATA[compile_info]]></c> to retrieve
            the compilation information directly as a term. (Thanks
            to Tobias Lindahl.)</p>

          <p>In rare circumstances, incorrect code for record or

            an exception at run time. (Thanks to Martin Bjorklund.)</p>

          <p>Given bit syntax construction in certain complex
            contexts involving a catch, the compiler would either
            crash or terminate due to failure in an internal
            consistency check. (Thanks to Fredrik Thulin.)</p>
          <p>Matches such as
            <c><![CDATA[<<103133:64/float>> = <<103133:64/float>>]]></c>
            used to fail. Now they succeed.</p>
          <p>Shadowing of variables in bit syntax matches in fun heads
            such as in
            <c><![CDATA[L = 8, F = fun(<<L:L,B:L>>) -> B end]]></c> was
            handled incorrectly by the compiler. The fun used to be
            compiled as if it was written
            '<c><![CDATA[>fun(<<8:8,B:8>>)]]></c>, while it should be
            compiled in the same way as <c><![CDATA[fun(<<L:8,B:L>>)]]></c>.</p>
          <p>A bug in the validation pass has been corrected. It
            sometimes occurred when the compiler optimized by reusing
            code for causing an exception when the reused code was
            called from within catch or try-catch statements. Then the
            validator refused to approve the code and complained about
            <c><![CDATA[fun(<<L:L,B:L>>) -> B end]]></c> was handled
            incorrectly by the in the same way as
            <c><![CDATA[fun(<<L:8,B:L>>)]]></c>.</p>
          <p>A bug in the unknown_catch_try_state.</p>
          <p>Corrected a bug in the optimizer that would cause
            the compiler to crash. (Thanks to Peter-Henry Mander.)</p>
          <p>There are now warnings generated if a bit syntax
            construction will fail at run-time because of a type
            mismatch (e.g. <c><![CDATA[<<an_atom:8>>]]></c>).</p>

            generates an error for any such patterns.</p>

          <p>In rare cases, the code compiler code generate code
            for a tuple match that could crash the emulator if passed
            a term that was not a tuple.</p>
          <p>If a bit syntax construction failed within a catch,
            previously assigned variables could get the wrong value.</p>
          <p>The compiler now runs a validation pass on the
            generated code and aborts before writing a Beam file if
            any suspect code is found. In particular, the validation
            pass checks for incorrect code that may cause emulator
            crashes or other strange symptoms in the emulator.</p>
