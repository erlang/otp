%% Constants

debug_runtime() -> false.
debug_counters() -> false.

%% Normal execution times for inlining are between 0.1 and 0.3 seconds
%% (on the author's current equipment). The default effort limit of 150
%% is high enough that most normal programs never hit the limit even
%% once, and for difficult programs, it generally keeps the execution
%% times below 2-5 seconds. Using an effort counter of 1000 will thus
%% have no further effect on most programs, but some programs may take
%% as much as 10 seconds or more. Effort counts larger than 2500 have
%% never been observed even on very ill-conditioned programs.
%%
%% Size limits between 6 and 18 tend to actually shrink the code,
%% because of the simplifications made possible by inlining. A limit of
%% 16 seems to be optimal for this purpose, often shrinking the
%% executable code by up to 10%. Size limits between 18 and 30 generally
%% give the same code size as if no inlining was done (i.e., code
%% duplication balances out the simplifications at these levels). A size
%% limit between 1 and 5 tends to inline small functions and propagate
%% constants, but does not cause much simplifications do be done, so the
%% net effect will be a slight increase in code size. For size limits
%% above 30, the executable code size tends to increase with about 10%
%% per 100 units, with some variations depending on the sizes of
%% functions in the source code.
%%
%% Typically, about 90% of the maximum speedup achievable is already
%% reached using a size limit of 30, and 98% is reached at limits around
%% 100-150; there is rarely any point in letting the code size increase
%% by more than 10-15%. If too large functions are inlined, cache
%% effects will slow the program down.

%% corresponding catch should be set up before entering the function.
%%
%% Note: if the inlined body is some lambda abstraction, and the
%% surrounding context of the app-context is also an app-context, the
%% `inlined' flag of the outermost context will be set before that of
%% the inner context is set. E.g.: `let F = fun (X) -> fun (Y) -> E in

%% abstraction, into the outer application context, which will be
%% inlined to produce expression `E', and the flag of the outer context
%% will be set. Upon return, the flag of the inner context will also be
%% set. However, the flags are then tested in innermost-first order.

%% nested app-contexts must be cleared.

%% Here, `R' is the ref-structure which is the target of the copy
%% propagation, and `Opnd' is a visited operand structure, to be
%% propagated through `R' if possible - if not, `R' is residualised.
%% `Opnd' is normally the operand that `R' is bound to, and `E' is the
%% result of visiting `Opnd' for value; we pass this as an argument so
%% we don't have to fetch it multiple times (because we don't have
%% constant time access).
%%
%% We also pass the environment of the site of the variable reference,
%% for use when inlining a propagated fun-expression. In the original
%% algorithm by Waddell, the environment used for inlining such cases is
%% the identity mapping, because the fun-expression body has already
%% been visited for value, and their algorithm combines renaming of
%% source-code variables with the looking up of information about
%% residual-code variables. We, however, need to check the environment
%% of the call site when creating new non-shadowed variables, but we
%% must avoid repeated renaming. We therefore separate the renaming and
%% the environment (as in the renaming algorithm of Peyton-Jones and
%% Marlow). This also makes our implementation more general, compared to
%% the original algorithm, because we do not give up on propagating
%% variables that were free in the fun-body.
%%
%%  Example:
%%
%%	let F = fun (X) -> {'foo', X} in
%%	let G = fun (H) -> apply H(F)        % F is free in the fun G
%%	in apply G(fun (F) -> apply F(42))
%%	  =>
%%	let F = fun (X) -> {'foo', X} in
%%	apply (fun (H) -> apply H(F))(fun (F) -> apply F(42))
%%	  =>
%%	let F = fun (X) -> {'foo', X} in
%%	apply (fun (F) -> apply F(42))(F)
%%	  =>
%%	let F = fun (X) -> {'foo', X} in
%%	apply F(42)
%%	  =>
%%	apply (fun (X) -> {'foo', X})(2)
%%	  =>
%%	{'foo', 42}
%%
%%  The original algorithm would give up at stage 4, because F was free
%%  in the propagated fun-expression. Our version inlines this example
%%  completely.

%% the subsequent pass. The latter may then be used as a safe
%% approximation whenever we need to base a decision on whether or not a
%% particular variable or function variable could be referenced in the
%% program being generated, and computation of the new
%% "residual-referenced" flag for that variable is not yet finished. In
%% the present algorithm, this can only happen in the presence of
%% variable assignments, which do not exist in Erlang. Therefore, we do
%% not keep "source-referenced" flags for residual-code references in
%% our implementation.
%%
%% The "inner-pending" flag tells us whether we are already in the
%% process of visiting a particular operand, and the "outer-pending"
%% flag whether we are in the process of inlining a propagated
%% functional value. The "pending flags" are really counters limiting
%% the number of times an operand may be inlined recursively, causing
%% loop unrolling. Note that the initial value must be greater than zero
%% in order for any inlining at all to be done.

%% Flags are stored in ETS-tables, one table for each class. The second
%% element in each stored tuple is the key (the "label").
