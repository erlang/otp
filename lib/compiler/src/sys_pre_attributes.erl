%% Purpose : Transform Erlang compiler attributes

-module(sys_pre_attributes).

-export([parse_transform/2]).

-define(OPTION_TAG, attributes).

-record(state, {forms,
		pre_ops = [],
		post_ops = [],
		options}).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Inserts, deletes and replaces Erlang compiler attributes.
%% 
%% Valid options are:
%% 
%%    {attribute, insert,  AttrName, NewAttrVal}   
%%    {attribute, replace, AttrName, NewAttrVal}   % replace first occurrence
%%    {attribute, delete,  AttrName}
%%
%% The transformation is performed in two passes:
%%
%% pre_transform
%% -------------
%% Searches for attributes in the list of Forms in order to
%% delete or replace them. 'delete' will delete all occurrences
%% of attributes with the given name. 'replace' will replace the
%% first occurrence of the attribute. This pass is will only be
%% performed if there are replace or delete operations stated
%% as options.
%% 
%% post_transform
%% -------------
%% Looks up the module attribute and inserts the new attributes
%% directly after. This pass will only be performed if there are
%% any attributes left to be inserted after pre_transform. The left
%% overs will be those replace operations that not has been performed
%% due to that the pre_transform pass did not find the attribute plus
%% all insert operations.
