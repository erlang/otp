%%  Filename : 	hipe_rtl_arith_32.erl
%%  Module   :	hipe_rtl_arith_32
%%  Purpose  :  To implement 32-bit RTL-arithmetic 
%%  Notes    :  The arithmetic works on 32-bit signed integers. 
%%              The implementation is taken from the implementation
%%              of arithmetic on SPARC.
%%              XXX: This code is seldom used, and hence also
%%                   seldom tested. 
%%                   Look here for strange bugs appearing when
%%                   turning on rtl_prop.
%%
%%  History  :	* 2002-10-23 Erik Stenman (happi@it.uu.se): Created.
