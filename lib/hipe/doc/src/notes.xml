      <list>
        <item>
	    <p>The HiPE compiler could crash when compiling certain
	    modules (the bug has been latent, and been exposed by new
	    optimizations introduced in the BEAM compiler in R14A).
	    (Thanks to Mikael Pettersson.)</p>

      <list>
        <item>
	    <p><c>receive</c> statements that can only read out a
	    newly created reference are now specially optimized so
	    that it will execute in constant time regardless of the
	    number of messages in the receive queue for the process.
	    That optimization will benefit calls to
	    <c>gen_server:call()</c>. (See <c>gen:do_call/4</c> for
	    an example of a receive statement that will be
	    optimized.)</p>

	    Various changes to dialyzer-related files for R14.</p>
          <p>
	    - Dialyzer properly supports the new attribute
	    -export_type and checks that remote types only refer to
	    exported types. A warning is produced if some
	    files/applications refer to types defined in modules
	    which are neither in the PLT nor in the analyzed
	    applications.</p>
          <p>
	    - Support for detecting data races involving whereis/1
	    and unregister/1.</p>
          <p>
	    - More precise identification of the reason(s) why a
	    record construction violates the types declared for its
	    fields.</p>
          <p>
	    - Fixed bug in the handling of the 'or' guard.</p>
          <p>
	    - Better handling of the erlang:element/2 BIF.</p>
          <p>
	    - Complete handling of Erlang BIFs.</p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-8699</p>
        </item>
        <item>
	    <p><c>eprof</c> has been reimplemented with support in
	    the Erlang virtual machine and is now both faster (i.e.
	    slows down the code being measured less) and scales much
	    better. In measurements we saw speed-ups compared to the
	    old eprof ranging from 6 times (for sequential code that
	    only uses one scheduler/core) up to 84 times (for
	    parallel code that uses 8 cores).</p>
	    <p>Note: The API for the <c>eprof</c> has been cleaned up
	    and extended. See the documentation.</p>

<section><title>Hipe 3.7.5</title>

    <section><title>Improvements and New Features</title>
      <list>
        <item>
	    <p>The documentation is now possible to build in an open
	    source environment after a number of bugs are fixed and
	    some features are added in the documentation build
	    process. </p>
	    <p>- The arity calculation is updated.</p>
	    <p>- The module prefix used in the function names for
	    bif's are removed in the generated links so the links
	    will look like
	    "http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#append_element-2"
	    instead of
	    "http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#erlang:append_element-2".</p>
	    <p>- Enhanced the menu positioning in the html
	    documentation when a new page is loaded.</p>
	    <p>- A number of corrections in the generation of man
	    pages (thanks to Sergei Golovan)</p>
	    <p>- The legal notice is taken from the xml book file so
	    OTP's build process can be used for non OTP
	    applications.</p>

        <item>
          <p>
	    The documentation is now built with open source tools
	    (xsltproc and fop) that exists on most platforms. One
	    visible change is that the frames are removed.</p>

    <section><title>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</title>
      <list>
        <item>
	    <p>A fix for an #include problem which caused the FP
	    exception test to fail unnecessarily on
	    debian/glibc-2.7/x86 systems.</p>
	    <p>Added SIGFPE loop detection to the FP exception test.
	    This prevents the test from looping indefinitely, which
	    could happen when the CPU is supported (so we can enable
	    FP exceptions on it) but the OS isn't (so we can't write
	    a proper SIGFPE handler). x86 on an unsupported OS is
	    known to have had this problem.</p>

	    HIPE: Corrected the choice of interface to the send/3 and
	    setnode/3 BIFs for native-compiled code. Using the
	    incorrect interface could, in unusual circumstances, lead
	    to random runtime errors.</p>
