	    The documentation is now built with open source tools
	    (xsltproc and fop) that exists on most platforms. One
	    visible change is that the frames are removed.</p>

<section><title>Hipe 3.6.6</title>

    <section><title>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</title>
      <list>
        <item>
	    <p>A fix for an #include problem which caused the FP
	    exception test to fail unnecessarily on
	    debian/glibc-2.7/x86 systems.</p>
	    <p>Added SIGFPE loop detection to the FP exception test.
	    This prevents the test from looping indefinitely, which
	    could happen when the CPU is supported (so we can enable
	    FP exceptions on it) but the OS isn't (so we can't write
	    a proper SIGFPE handler). x86 on an unsupported OS is
	    known to have had this problem.</p>

          <p>
	    HIPE: Corrected the choice of interface to the send/3 and
	    setnode/3 BIFs for native-compiled code. Using the
	    incorrect interface could, in unusual circumstances, lead
	    to random runtime errors.</p>

          <p>HiPE runtime system:</p>
          <p>* added notes about supported systems to README</p>
          <p>* support 32-bit x86 on FreeBSD</p>
          <p>* autoenable HiPE on FreeBSD (32-bit x86) and Solaris
            (64-bit x86)</p>
          <p>* updated x86 runtime system to support glibc-2.5</p>
          <p>* work around probable gcc-4.1.1 bug affecting the x86
            runtime system</p>
          <p>HiPE compiler:</p>
          <p>* improved performance of integer multiplications on
            all platforms</p>
          <p>* corrected a code optimisation error in R11B-2 that
            broke some bsl/bsr operations on all platforms</p>
          <p>* corrected a type error in the ARM backend which
            could cause the compiler to crash</p>
          <p>* corrected an error in the SPARC backend's naive
            register allocator which could throw the compiler into an
            infinite loop</p>
