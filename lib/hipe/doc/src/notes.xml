	    Fix various binary construction inconsistencies for hipe
	    compiled code. <list> <item>Passing bad field sizes to
	    binary constructions would throw <c>badarith</c> rather
	    than <c>badarg</c>. Worse, in guards, when the unit size
	    of the field was 1, the exception would leak rather than
	    failing the function clause match.</item> <item>Passing
	    bignums as field sizes to binary constructions would
	    always fail (and always with <c>badarg</c>).</item>
	    <item>A bug in bs_init_bits that cased binary
	    constructions to fail with system_limit if they were at
	    least 1/8th of the actual limit.</item> <item>Compiler
	    crashes when matches against an integer literal whose
	    size fits an unsigned word, but not a signed word or
	    matches against an integer literal that whose size is
	    larger than the largest allowed bignum.</item> <item>Very
	    large binary constructions that should fail with
	    system_limit could instead fail with <c>badarg</c> or
	    even succeed with a faulty result.</item> <item>Add
	    missing check for unit size match when inserting a
	    binary. For example, a faulty expression like
	    <c>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;1:7&gt;&gt;/binary&gt;&gt;</c> would
	    succeed.</item> </list></p>

	    In certain cases of matching with very big binaries, the
	    HiPE compiler generated code that would fail the match,
	    even in cases that the matching was successful. The
	    problem was more quite noticeable on 32-bit platforms.</p>

	    A beam file compiled by hipe for an incompatible runtime
	    system was sometimes not rejected by the loader, which

	    hipe compiler to be used by both normal and debug-built

	    Fix two bugs in HiPE compiler regarding floating-points,
	    both leading to crash during compilation. The
	    target-specific code generators failed to handle integer
	    to floating-point conversion instructions with constant
	    operands. The middle-end could use an incorrect
	    representation for copies between floating-point
	    registers.</p>

	    <p> The pre-defined types <c>array/0</c>, <c>dict/0</c>,
	    <c>digraph/0</c>, <c>gb_set/0</c>, <c>gb_tree/0</c>,
	    <c>queue/0</c>, <c>set/0</c>, and <c>tid/0</c> have been
	    deprecated. They will be removed in Erlang/OTP 18.0. </p>
	    <p> Instead the types <c>array:array/0</c>,
	    <c>dict:dict/0</c>, <c>digraph:graph/0</c>,
	    <c>gb_set:set/0</c>, <c>gb_tree:tree/0</c>,

	    <c>ets:tid/0</c> can be used. (Note: it has always been
	    necessary to use <c>ets:tid/0</c>.) </p> <p> It is
	    allowed in Erlang/OTP 17.0 to locally re-define the types
	    <c>array/0</c>, <c>dict/0</c>, and so on. </p> <p> New

	    added. </p> <p> A compiler option,
	    <c>nowarn_deprecated_type</c>, has been introduced. By
	    including the attribute </p> <c>
	    -compile(nowarn_deprecated_type).</c> <p> in an Erlang
	    source file, warnings about deprecated types can be
	    avoided in Erlang/OTP 17.0. </p> <p> The option can also

          <taglist>
            <tag/> <item><c>M0 = #{ a =&gt; 1, b =&gt; 2}, % create
	      associations</c></item>

               % match keys with values</c></item>

          <p>
	    The BEAM disassembler used the atom 'none' to signify the
	    absence of a compile_info chunk in a .beam file. This
	    clashed with the type declaration of the compile_info
	    field of a #beam_file{} record as containing a list. Now
	    [] signifies the absence of this chunk. This simplifies
	    the code and avoids a dialyzer warning.</p>

	    Sanitize the specs of the code module</p>
          <p>
	    After the addition of unicode_binary() to the
	    file:filename() type, dialyzer started complaining about
	    erroneous or incomplete specs in some functions of the
	    'code' module. The culprit was hard-coded information in
	    erl_bif_types for functions of this module, which were
	    not updated. Since these functions have proper specs
	    these days and code duplication (pun intended) is never a
	    good idea, their type information was removed from
	    erl_bif_types.</p>
          <p>
	    While doing this, some erroneous comments were fixed in
	    the code module and also made sure that the code now runs
	    without dialyzer warnings even when the
	    -Wunmatched_returns option is used.</p>
          <p>
	    Some cleanups were applied to erl_bif_types too.</p>

	    On 31/1/2011 Paul Guyot reported a bug in the native code
	    compilation of inexact equality/inequality tests between
	    floats and integers. The relevant test was:</p>
          <p>
	    f(X) -&gt; Y = X / 2, Y == 0.</p>
          <p>
	    and hipe erroneously evaluated the calls f(0) and f(0.0)
	    to 'false'.</p>
          <p>
	    The culprit was in the simplification code of the Icode
	    range analysis which used an erroneous test (lists:any/1
	    instead of lists:all/1).</p>

	    Remove hipe constants pool</p>
          <p>
	    Hipe constants used to be allocated within a single,
	    fixed-size pool for interaction with the garbage
	    collector. However, the garbage collector no longer
	    depends on constants being allocated within a single
	    pool, and the fixed size of the pool both meant
	    unnecessary allocations on most deployments and crashes
	    on deployments requiring more constants.</p>
          <p>
	    The code was simplified to directly invoke erts_alloc.
	    Debugging and undocumented function
	    hipe_bifs:show_literals/0 was removed (it returned true
	    and output text to the console), and debugging and
	    undocumented function hipe_bifs:constants_size/0 was
	    rewritten with a global to count the size of allocated
	    constants.</p>

	    old eprof ranging from 6 times (for sequential code that
	    only uses one scheduler/core) up to 84 times (for
	    parallel code that uses 8 cores).</p>
	    <p>Note: The API for the <c>eprof</c> has been cleaned up

        <item>
	    <p>A fix for an #include problem which caused the FP
	    exception test to fail unnecessarily on
	    debian/glibc-2.7/x86 systems.</p>
	    <p>Added SIGFPE loop detection to the FP exception test.
	    This prevents the test from looping indefinitely, which
	    could happen when the CPU is supported (so we can enable
	    FP exceptions on it) but the OS isn't (so we can't write
	    a proper SIGFPE handler). x86 on an unsupported OS is
	    known to have had this problem.</p>

	    HIPE: Corrected the choice of interface to the send/3 and
	    setnode/3 BIFs for native-compiled code. Using the
	    incorrect interface could, in unusual circumstances, lead
	    to random runtime errors.</p>
