	    Fixed a discrepancy in compile_info</p>
          <p>
	    The BEAM disassembler used the atom 'none' to signify the
	    absence of a compile_info chunk in a .beam file. This
	    clashed with the type declaration of the compile_info
	    field of a #beam_file{} record as containing a list. Now
	    [] signifies the absence of this chunk. This simplifies
	    the code and avoids a dialyzer warning.</p>

	    The change fixes a bug in the translation of 'bs_add'

	    Sanitize the specs of the code module</p>
          <p>
	    After the addition of unicode_binary() to the
	    file:filename() type, dialyzer started complaining about
	    erroneous or incomplete specs in some functions of the
	    'code' module. The culprit was hard-coded information in
	    erl_bif_types for functions of this module, which were
	    not updated. Since these functions have proper specs
	    these days and code duplication (pun intended) is never a
	    good idea, their type information was removed from
	    erl_bif_types.</p>
          <p>
	    While doing this, some erroneous comments were fixed in
	    the code module and also made sure that the code now runs
	    without dialyzer warnings even when the
	    -Wunmatched_returns option is used.</p>
          <p>
	    Some cleanups were applied to erl_bif_types too.</p>

	    Fix bug in the simplification of inexact comparisons</p>
          <p>
	    On 31/1/2011 Paul Guyot reported a bug in the native code
	    compilation of inexact equality/inequality tests between
	    floats and integers. The relevant test was:</p>
          <p>
	    f(X) -&gt; Y = X / 2, Y == 0.</p>
          <p>
	    and hipe erroneously evaluated the calls f(0) and f(0.0)
	    to 'false'.</p>
          <p>
	    The culprit was in the simplification code of the Icode
	    range analysis which used an erroneous test (lists:any/1
	    instead of lists:all/1).</p>

	    Remove hipe constants pool</p>
          <p>
	    Hipe constants used to be allocated within a single,
	    fixed-size pool for interaction with the garbage
	    collector. However, the garbage collector no longer
	    depends on constants being allocated within a single
	    pool, and the fixed size of the pool both meant
	    unnecessary allocations on most deployments and crashes
	    on deployments requiring more constants.</p>
          <p>
	    The code was simplified to directly invoke erts_alloc.
	    Debugging and undocumented function
	    hipe_bifs:show_literals/0 was removed (it returned true
	    and output text to the console), and debugging and
	    undocumented function hipe_bifs:constants_size/0 was
	    rewritten with a global to count the size of allocated
	    constants.</p>

	    - Dialyzer properly supports the new attribute
	    -export_type and checks that remote types only refer to
	    exported types. A warning is produced if some
	    files/applications refer to types defined in modules
	    which are neither in the PLT nor in the analyzed
	    applications.</p>
          <p>
	    - Support for detecting data races involving whereis/1
	    and unregister/1.</p>
          <p>
	    - More precise identification of the reason(s) why a
	    record construction violates the types declared for its
	    fields.</p>
          <p>
	    - Fixed bug in the handling of the 'or' guard.</p>

	    <p><c>eprof</c> has been reimplemented with support in
	    the Erlang virtual machine and is now both faster (i.e.
	    slows down the code being measured less) and scales much
	    better. In measurements we saw speed-ups compared to the
	    old eprof ranging from 6 times (for sequential code that
	    only uses one scheduler/core) up to 84 times (for
	    parallel code that uses 8 cores).</p>
	    <p>Note: The API for the <c>eprof</c> has been cleaned up
	    and extended. See the documentation.</p>

	    <p>The documentation is now possible to build in an open
	    source environment after a number of bugs are fixed and
	    some features are added in the documentation build
	    process. </p>
	    <p>- The arity calculation is updated.</p>
	    <p>- The module prefix used in the function names for
	    bif's are removed in the generated links so the links
	    will look like
	    "http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#append_element-2"
	    instead of
	    "http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#erlang:append_element-2".</p>
	    <p>- Enhanced the menu positioning in the html
	    documentation when a new page is loaded.</p>
	    <p>- A number of corrections in the generation of man
	    pages (thanks to Sergei Golovan)</p>
	    <p>- The legal notice is taken from the xml book file so
	    OTP's build process can be used for non OTP
	    applications.</p>

	    <p>A fix for an #include problem which caused the FP
	    exception test to fail unnecessarily on
	    debian/glibc-2.7/x86 systems.</p>
	    <p>Added SIGFPE loop detection to the FP exception test.
	    This prevents the test from looping indefinitely, which
	    could happen when the CPU is supported (so we can enable
	    FP exceptions on it) but the OS isn't (so we can't write
	    a proper SIGFPE handler). x86 on an unsupported OS is
	    known to have had this problem.</p>
