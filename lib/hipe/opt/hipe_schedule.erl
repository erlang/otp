%%			INSTRUCTION SCHEDULER
%%
%% This is a basic ILP cycle scheduler:
%% * set cycle = 0
%% * while ready[cycle] nonempty do
%%   - take x with greatest priority from ready[cycle]
%%   - try to schedule x;
%%     * if scheduling x was possible, 
%%       - reserve resources
%%       - add x to schedule and delete x from dag
%%       - update earliest-time for all successor nodes
%%         as max[earliest[y],cycle+latency[x]]
%%       - if some node y now has no predecessors,
%%         add y to ready[earliest[y]]
%%     * if it was impossible, put x in ready[cycle+1]
%%       (= try again)
%%
%% We use the following data structures:
%% 1. all nodes are numbered and indices used as array keys
%% 2. priority per node can be computed statically or dynamically
%%    * statically: before scheduling, each node gets a priority value
%%    * dynamically: at each cycle, compute priorities for all ready nodes
%% 3. earliest: earliest cycle of issue, starts at 0
%%    and is updated as predecessors issue
%% 4. predecessors: number of predecessors (0 = ready to issue)
%% 5. successors: list of {Latency,NodeID}
%% 6. ready: an array indexed by cycle-time (integer), where
%%    ready nodes are kept.
%% 7. resources: a resource representation (ADT) that answers
%%    certain queries, e.g., "can x be scheduled this cycle"
%%    and "reserve resources for x".
%% 8. schedule: list of scheduled instructions {Instr,Cycle}
%%    in the order of issue
%% 9. instructions: maps IDs back to instructions
%%
%% Inputs:
%% - a list of {ID,Node} pairs (where ID is a unique key)
%% - a dependence list {ID0,Latency,ID1}, which is used to
%%   build the DAG.
%%
%% Note that there is some leeway in how things are represented
%% from here.
%%
%% MODIFICATIONS:
%% - Some basic blocks are not worth scheduling (e.g., GC save/restore code)
%%   yet are pretty voluminous. How do we skip them?
%% - Scheduling should be done at finalization time: when basic block is
%%   linearized and is definitely at Sparc assembly level, THEN reorder
%%   stuff.

%% Given a memory operation and a 'memory op state',
%% overlap(N,MemOp,State) returns { Preceding_Dependent_Ops, NewState }.
%%  which are either a tuple { WAW_deps, WAR_deps } or a list RAW_deps.
%%
%% NOTES:
%%  Note that Erlang's semantics ("heap stores never overwrite existing data")
%% means we can be quite free in reordering stores to the heap.
%%  Ld/St to the stack are simply handled by their offsets; since we do not
%% rename the stack pointer, this is sufficient.
%%  *** We assume all memory ops have uniform size = 4 ***
%%
%% NOTES:
%%  The method mentioned above has now been changed because the assumption that
%%  "heap stores never overwrite existing data" caused a bug when the
%%   process-pointer was treated the same way as the heap. We were also told 
%%   that the semantics can possibly change in the future, so it would be more 
%%   safe to treat the heap store/loads as the stack.
%%   A future improvement can be to do an alias analysis to give more freedom
%%   in reordering stuff...
