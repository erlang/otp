    <title>ERLANG HTTP SERVER SERVICE START/STOP </title>
    <p>A web server can be configured to start when starting the inets
      application or started dynamically in runtime by calling the
      Inets application API <c>inets:start(httpd, ServiceConfig)</c>, or
      <c>inets:start(httpd, ServiceConfig, How)</c>,
      see <seealso marker="inets">inets(3)</seealso> Below follows a
      description of the available configuration options, also called
      properties.</p>

    <marker id="file_prop"></marker>
    <p><em>File properties</em></p>

    <p>When the web server is started
    at application start time the properties should be fetched from a
    configuration file that could consist of a regular erlang property
    list, e.i.  <c>[{Option, Value}] </c> where <c> Option = property()
    </c> and <c>Value = term()</c>, followed by a full stop, or for
    backwards compatibility an Apache like configuration file. If the
    web server is started dynamically at runtime you may still specify
    a file but you could also just specify the complete property
    list.</p>
    
    <taglist>
      <tag>{proplist_file, path()}</tag>
      <item>
	If this property is defined inets will expect to find
       all other properties defined in this file. Note that the
       file must include all properties listed under mandatory
       properties. </item>
      <tag>{file, path()}</tag>

      <item> If this property is defined
	inets will expect to find all other properties defined in this
	file, that uses Apache like syntax. Note that the file must
	include all properties listed under mandatory properties. The
	Apache like syntax is the property, written as one word where
	each new word begins with a capital, followed by a white-space
	followed by the value followed by a new line. Ex:

	<code>
{server_root, "/urs/local/www"} -> ServerRoot /usr/local/www
	</code>
	  
	<p>With a few exceptions, that are documented
	  for each property that behaves differently,
	  and the special case {directory, {path(), PropertyList}} and
	  {security_directory, {Dir, PropertyList}} that are represented
	  as:</p>
	<pre>
	  <![CDATA[
<Directory Dir>
 <Properties handled as described above> 
</Directory>
         ]]>
	</pre>

          The mapping between file suffixes and MIME types can be specified

	<pre>
remotehost
	Remote
rfc931
	The client's remote username (RFC 931). 
authuser
	The username with which the user authenticated 
        himself. 
[date]
	Date and time of the request (RFC 1123). 
"request"
	The request line exactly as it came from the client
        (RFC 1945). 
status
	The HTTP status code returned to the client 
        (RFC 1945). 
bytes
	The content-length of the document transferred. 
        </pre>

	<p>The <c>combined</c> format is on line that look like this:
	<c>remotehost rfc931 authuser [date] "request" status bytes "referer" "user_agent" </c></p>

      <item> Where Alias = string() and RealName = string(). 
	The Alias property allows documents to be stored in the local file
	system instead of the document_root location. URLs with a path that
	begins with url-path is mapped to local files that begins with
	directory-filename, for example:
	
	<code>{alias, {"/image", "/ftp/pub/image"}</code>
	
	and an access to http://your.server.org/image/foo.gif would refer to
	the file /ftp/pub/image/foo.gif.</item>

      <tag>{re_write, {Re, Replacement}}</tag>
      
      <item> Where Re = string() and Replacement = string(). 
	The ReWrite property allows documents to be stored in the local file
	system instead of the document_root location. URLs are rewritten
        by re:replace/3 to produce a path in the local filesystem.
        For example:
	
	<code>{re_write, {"^/[~]([^/]+)(.*)$", "/home/\\1/public\\2"}</code>
	
	and an access to http://your.server.org/~bob/foo.gif would refer to
	the file /home/bob/public/foo.gif.

        In an Apache like configuration file the Re is separated
        from Replacement with one single space, and as expected
        backslashes do not need to be backslash escaped so the
        same example would become:

        <code>ReWrite ^/[~]([^/]+)(.*)$ /home/\1/public\2</code>

        Beware of trailing space in Replacement that will be used.
        If you must have a space in Re use e.g the character encoding
        <code>\040</code> see <seealso marker="stdlib:re">re(3)</seealso>.

	DirectoryIndex specifies a list of resources to look for
	if a client requests a directory using a / at the end of the
	directory name. file depicts the name of a file in the
	directory. Several files may be given, in which case the server
	will return the first it finds, for example:
	
	<code>{directory_index, ["index.hml", "welcome.html"]}</code>
	
	and access to http://your.server.org/docs/ would return
	http://your.server.org/docs/index.html or

      <item>
	Sets the type of authentication database that is used for the

	Sets the name of a file which contains the list of users and
	passwords for user authentication. filename can be either
	absolute or relative to the <c>server_root</c>. If using the
	plain storage method, this file is a plain text file, where
	each line contains a user name followed by a colon, followed
	by the non-encrypted password. If user names are duplicated,
	the behavior is undefined. For example:
	
	<code> ragnar:s7Xxv7

	If using the dets storage method, the user database is
	maintained by dets and should not be edited by hand. Use the
	API functions in mod_auth module to create / edit the user

      <item> Sets the name of a file which contains the list of user
	groups for user authentication. Filename can be either

	storage method, the group file is a plain text file, where
	each line contains a group name followed by a colon, followed
	by the member user names separated by spaces. For example:
	
	<code>group1: bob joe ante</code>
          
	If using the dets storage method, the group database is
	maintained by dets and should not be edited by hand. Use the
	API for mod_auth module to create / edit the group database.
	This directive is ignored if using the mnesia storage method.
	For security reasons, make sure that the <c>auth_group_file</c> is
	stored outside the document tree of the Web server. If it is

	name and password to use. </item>

      <tag>{auth_access_password, string()}</tag>

      <item> If set to other than "NoPassword" the password is required
	for all API calls. If the password is set to "DummyPassword" the
	password must be changed before any other API calls. To secure
	the authenticating data the password must be changed after the
	web server is started since it otherwise is written in clear
