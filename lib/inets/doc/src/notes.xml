	    The commit 6189bc07 "inets: httpc improve pipelining" has
	    been reverted, as it turned out to break things rather
	    than improve pipelining utilization. It is instead up to
	    the user to configure httpc and use it wisely to be able
	    to get the most out of pipelining.</p>

	    Make httpc:request_cancel/[1,2] asynchronous. Previously
	    these functions tried to guarantee request answer would
	    not reach the client, which only worked for some of the
	    use cases. Now these functions are totally asynchronous
	    which makes it the clients responsibility to disregard
	    possible answers to canceled requests. </p>
          <p>
	    Also pipelining implementation has been changed to
	    improve the utilization factor. Further investigation of
	    possible enhancements in this area are planned for later.</p>

	    Integrate elliptic curve contribution from Andreas
	    Schultz </p>
          <p>
	    In order to be able to support elliptic curve cipher
	    suites in SSL/TLS, additions to handle elliptic curve
	    infrastructure has been added to public_key and crypto.</p>
          <p>
	    This also has resulted in a rewrite of the crypto API to
	    gain consistency and remove unnecessary overhead. All OTP
	    applications using crypto has been updated to use the new
	    API.</p>
          <p>
	    Impact: Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) offers
	    equivalent security with smaller key sizes than other
	    public key algorithms. Smaller key sizes result in
	    savings for power, memory, bandwidth, and computational
	    cost that make ECC especially attractive for constrained
	    environments.</p>

	    [httpc] If a request times out (not connect timeout), the

	    the manager process. For this reason, the manager did not
	    clean up the request table., resulting in a memory leak.
	    Also the manager did not create a monitor for the

          <p>This is a modification to the http_chunk module to forward any 
            full chunk received, regardless of whether the size field for the 
            following chunk has been received yet.  This allows http_chunk to 
            be used in situations where a long term HTTP connection is used to 
            send periodic status updates as individual chunks.  Previously a 
            given chunk would not be forwarded to the client process until the 
            size for the next chunk had been read which rendered the module 
            difficult to use for the scenario described. </p>

		<p>Initial call between the httpc manager and request

		<p>When the manager starts a new request handler, 
                  this is no longer a synchronous operation. Previously, 
                  the new request handler made the connection to the 
                  server and issuing of the first request (the reason 
                  for starting it) in the gen_server init function. 
                  If the connection for some reason "took some time", 
                  the manager hanged, leaving all other activities by

          <p>Previously, an attempt was made to check if the listing
            returned by the server was actually an error message. This
            was done by changing remote directory (cd) into the 
            (assumed) "directory". This may work if Pathname was actually 
            a directory, but as this is not always the case, this test 
            does not work. Instead, we now return the actual server
