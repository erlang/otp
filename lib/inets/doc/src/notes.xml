	    <p>[ftpc] - Start of the FTP client has been changed in 
              the following way: </p>
	      <list type="bulleted">
		<item>
		  <p>It is now also possible to start a standalone FTP client 
		    process using the re-introduced  
                    <seealso marker="ftp#open">ftp:open</seealso> 
                    function. </p>
                  <p>This is an alternative to starting the client using the 
		    <seealso marker="ftp#service_start">inets service framework</seealso>. </p>
		  <p>The old <c>ftp:open/1</c>, undocumented, function, 
                    caused the client to be hooken into the inets service
                    supervision framework. This is <em>no</em> longer the
                    case. </p>
                  <p>*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p>
		</item>
		<item>
                  <p>Previously, the FTP client attempted to use IPv6, 
                    unless otherwise instructed (the <c>ip_v6_disabled</c> 
                    flag), and only used IPv4 if this did not work. 
                    This has now been <em>changed</em>. </p>
                  <p>A new option, 
                    <seealso marker="ftp#ipfamily">ipfamily</seealso>, 
                    has been introduced, with the default value 
                    <c>inet</c> (IPv4). </p>
                  <p>See <seealso marker="ftp#open">ftp:open</seealso>

            <p>The documentation is now built with open source tools 
              (<em>xsltproc</em> and <em>fop</em>) that exists on most 
              platforms. One visible change is that the frames are removed.</p>

	  <p>[ftpc] - The 
            <seealso marker="ftp#ls2">ls/2</seealso> function (LIST command) 
            and the 
            <seealso marker="ftp#nlist2">nlist/2</seealso> function 
            (NLST command) 
            with wildcards did 
            not work properly. </p>
          <p>These functions is documented as working on directories, but 
            this is actually not according the standard. The LIST and NLST
            commands are specified to operate on a directory or other 
            group of files, or a file.</p>
          <p>Previously, an attempt was made to check if the listing
            returned by the server was actually an error message. This
            was done by changing remote directory (cd) into the 
            (assumed) "directory". This may work if Pathname was actually 
            a directory, but as this is not always the case, this test 
            does not work. Instead, we now return the actual server 
            result and leave the interpretation to the caller. </p>

	  <p>[httpc] - Raise condition. 
            When http:request is called and httpc_manager selects a session 
            where there's already a pending request, then the connection 
            handler for that session effectively resets its parser, readying
            it for the response to the second request. But if there are still 
            some inbound packets for the response to the first request, things 
            get confused.</p>

	    <p>[httpd] - When starting inets (the web-server) and supplying 
              a descriptor on the command line 
              (example: erl -httpd_8888 &lt;descriptor&gt;) 
              it is now possible to specify which ip-family to use:
              <c>inet | inet6 | inet6fb4</c>. </p>
            <p>Example: erl -httpd_8888 10|inet6</p>
            <p>When starting the web-server either using a file with 
              property list (the proplist_file) or a an property list,
              using the ipfamily option: 
              <c>{ipfamily, inet | inet6 | inet6fb4}</c>. </p>
            <p>Finally, when starting the web-server using the classical
              apache-style config file, the <c>BindAddress</c> directive
              has been augmented to allow the specification of the 
              IpFamily: <c>BindAddress blirk.ericsson.se|inet</c></p>
            <p>Default is <c>inet6fb4</c> which emulates the 
              behaviour of the previous version. </p>

            [tftp] If a callback (which performs the file access in
            the TFTP server) takes too long time (more than the
	    double TFTP timeout), the server will abort the
            connection and send an error reply to the client. This
	    implies that the server will release resources attached
            to the connection faster than before. The server simply
            assumes that the client has given up.</p>
          <p>
            [tftp] If the TFTP server receives yet another request
            from the same client (same host and port) while it
            already has an active connection to the client, it will
            simply ignore the new request if the request is equal
            with the first one (same filename and options). This
            implies that the (new) client will be served by the
            already ongoing connection on the server side. By not
            setting up yet another connection, in parallel with the
            ongoing one, the server will consumer lesser resources.</p>
          <p>
            [tftp] netascii mode is now supported when the
            client/server has native ascii support (Windows). The new
            optional parameter native_ascii in the tftp_binary and
            tftp_file callback modules can be used to override the
            default behavior.</p>
          <p>
            [tftp] Yet another callback module has been added in
            order to allow customized handling of error, warning and
            info messages. See the new configuration parameter,
            logger.</p>
          <p>
            [tftp] Yet another configuration parameter, max_retries,
            has been added in order to control the number of times a
            packet can be resent. The default is 5.</p>
          <p>
            [tftp] tftp:info/1 and tftp:change_config/2 can now be
            applied to all daemons or all servers in one command
            without bothering about their process identifiers.</p>

            [tftp] Blocks with too low block numbers are silently
            discarded. For example if a server receives block #5 when
            it expects block #7 it will discard the block without
            interrupting the file transfer. Too high block numbers
            does still imply an error. External TR HI96072.</p>

            and stopped i.e. it will not automatically be started as
            a temporary application as it did before. Although a
            practical feature when testing things in the shell it is
            not desirable that people take advantage of this and not
            start the Inets application in a correct way in their
            products. Added functions to the Inets API that call
            application:start/stop.</p>
