  <modulesummary>The inets services API</modulesummary>
  <description>
    <p>This module provides the most basic API to the 
    clients and servers, that are part of the Inets application,
    such as start and stop. </p>

        <note>
          <p>Dynamically started services will not be handled by
            application takeover and failover behavior when inets is
            run as a distributed application. Nor will they be
            automatically restarted when the inets application is
            restarted, but as long as the inets application is up and
            running they will be supervised and may be soft code
            upgraded. Services started as <c>stand_alone</c>,
            e.i. the service is not started as part of the inets
            application, will lose all OTP application benefits such
            as soft upgrade. The "stand_alone-service" will be linked to
            the process that started it. In most cases some of the
            supervision functionality will still be in place and in
            some sense the calling process has now become the top
            supervisor.</p>
