	<p>http_base_64:encode/decode and

      <item>
	<p>When making an asynchronous HTTP request and the
	  underlying gen_tcp:connect failed with timeout (not a
	  very common case) the return of the asynchronous HTTP
	  request was delayed for "timeout" seconds. This happened
	  due to the fact that when spawning a gen_server process
	  the spawn will wait for the init function to complete.
	  This is now avoided using proc_lib and
	  gen_server:enter_loop/3, hence the asynchronous HTTP
	  request return will not be delayed. Also the request
	  timeout value is now propagated to gen_tcp rather that
	  relying on the system default.</p>

	<p>[httpc] - When http:request/4 was used with a configured

	  entered an endless loop. Two problems was solved in this
	  area, the absolute uri is now updated when a redirect is

	  returning a bad credentials reply to the client.</p>

	<p>The internal design of using blocking gen_tcp:recv with a

	  The API is not effected except for the function
	  ftp:quote/2 which now returns a list of strings (ftp
	  result lines) where the line endings "\r\n" has been
	  removed. This was the original intention for the return
