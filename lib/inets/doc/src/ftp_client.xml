    <title>Introduction</title>

    <p>Ftp clients are consider to be rather temporary and are
      for that reason only started and stopped during
      runtime and can not be started at application startup.
      Due to the design of FTP client API, letting some
      functions return intermediate results, only the process
      that started the ftp client will be able to access it in
      order to preserve sane semantics. (This could be solved
      by changing the API and using the concept of a controlling
      process more in line with other OTP applications, but
      that is perhaps something for the future.) 
      If the process that started the ftp session 
      dies the ftp client process will terminate.</p>

    <p>The client supports ipv6 as long as the underlying mechanisms
      also do so. </p>

    <title>Using the FTP Client API</title>
    <p>The following is a simple example of an ftp session, where
      the user <c>guest</c> with password <c>password</c> logs on to
      the remote host <c>erlang.org</c>, and where the file
      <c>appl.erl</c> is transferred from the remote to the local
      host.  When the session is opened, the current directory at
      the remote host is <c>/home/guest</c>, and <c>/home/fred</c>
      at the local host. Before transferring the file, the current
      local directory is changed to <c>/home/eproj/examples</c>, and
      the remote directory is set to
      <c>/home/guest/appl/examples</c>.</p>
    <code type="erl"><![CDATA[

      ok
      6> ftp:lpwd(Pid).
      {ok, "/home/fred"}.
      7> ftp:lcd(Pid, "/home/eproj/examples").
      ok
