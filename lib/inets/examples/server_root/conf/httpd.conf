%% BindAddress: This directive is used to tell the server which IP address
%% to listen to. It can either contain "*", an IP address, or a fully
%% qualified Internet domain name.
%% 
%% It is also possible to specify the ip-family with the directive.
%% There ar three possible value: inet, inet6 and inet6fb4
%% inet:     Use IpFamily inet when retrieving the address and
%%           fail if that does not work.
%% inet6:    Use IpFamily inet6 when retrieving the address and
%%           fail if that does not work.
%% inet6fb4: First IpFamily inet6 is tried and if that does not work, 
%%           inet is used as fallback. 
%% Default value for ip-family is inet6fb4
%% 
%% The syntax is: <address>[|<ip-family>]

%% ServerName allows you to set a host name which is sent back to clients for

%% "www" instead of the host's real name).

%% Note: You cannot just invent host names and hope they work. The name you 
%% define here must be a valid DNS name for your host. If you don't understand
%% this, ask your network administrator.
