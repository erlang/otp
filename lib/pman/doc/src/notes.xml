        <item>
          <p>Some maintenance work to replace deprecated guard
            expressions etc. somehow grew into a larger rewrite of
            parts of the Pman code, fixing some of the more blatant
            errors and removing unused code.</p>
          <p>The default font has been changed, so now the entire text
            on buttons etc. should be visible on most platforms.</p>
          <p>Saving and restoring trace options to/from file now
            works.</p>
          <p>Selecting different sets of processes to hide/view should
            now work in a more consistent and logical way.</p>
          <p>It is now possible to select more than one module or
            process to hide/show.</p>

          <p>Some dead code reported by Dialyzer was eliminated.</p>
          <p>A bug in <c>dbg</c> when tracing to wrap trace files
            has been corrected. It failed to delete any already existing
            wrap trace files with the same names when starting a new
            wrap trace.</p>

          <p>The Pman 'trace shell' functionality was broken, it has
            now been fixed. Furthermore, Pman could not correctly
            find the pid of the active shell if more than one shell
            process was running on the node. This has also been
            corrected.</p>
