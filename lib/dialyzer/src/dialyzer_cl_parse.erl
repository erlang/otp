  "Warning options:
  -Wno_return
     Suppress warnings for functions that will never return a value.
  -Wno_unused
     Suppress warnings for unused functions.
  -Wno_improper_lists
     Suppress warnings for construction of improper lists.
  -Wno_fun_app
     Suppress warnings for fun applications that will fail.
  -Wno_match
     Suppress warnings for patterns that are unused or cannot match.
  -Wno_opaque
     Suppress warnings for violations of opacity of data types.
  -Wno_fail_call
     Suppress warnings for failing calls.
  -Wno_contracts
     Suppress warnings about invalid contracts.
  -Wno_behaviours
     Suppress warnings about behaviour callbacks which drift from the published
     recommended interfaces.
  -Wno_missing_calls
     Suppress warnings about calls to missing functions.
  -Wno_undefined_callbacks
     Suppress warnings about behaviours that have no -callback attributes for
     their callbacks.
  -Wno_unknown
     Suppress warnings about unknown functions and types. The default is to
     warn about unknown functions and types when setting the exit
     status. When using Dialyzer from Erlang, warnings about unknown functions
     and types are returned.
  -Wunmatched_returns ***
     Include warnings for function calls which ignore a structured return
     value or do not match against one of many possible return value(s).
  -Werror_handling ***
     Include warnings for functions that only return by means of an exception.
  -Wunderspecs ***
     Warn about underspecified functions
     (those whose -spec is strictly more allowing than the success typing).
  -Wextra_return ***
     Warn about functions whose specification includes types that the
     function cannot return.
  -Wmissing_return ***
     Warn about functions that return values that are not part
     of the specification.
  -Woverlapping_contract ***
     Warn about overloaded functions whose specification include types that overlap.

The following options are also available but their use is not recommended:
(they are mostly for Dialyzer developers and internal debugging)
  -Woverspecs ***
     Warn about overspecified functions
     (those whose -spec is strictly less allowing than the success typing).
  -Wspecdiffs ***
     Warn when the -spec is different than the success typing.

*** Identifies options that turn on warnings rather than turning them off.

The following options are not strictly needed as they specify the default.
They are primarily intended to be used with the -dialyzer attribute:
  -Wno_underspecs
     Suppress warnings about underspecified functions (those whose -spec
     is strictly more allowing than the success typing).
  -Wno_extra_return
     Suppress warnings about functions whose specification includes types that the function cannot return.
  -Wno_missing_return
     Suppress warnings about functions that return values that are not part of the specification.

configuration_file_msg() ->
    "Configuration file:
     Dialyzer's configuration file may also be used to augment the default
     options and those given directly to the Dialyzer command. It is commonly
     used to avoid repeating options which would otherwise need to be given
     explicitly to Dialyzer on every invocation.

     The location of the configuration file can be set via the
     DIALYZER_CONFIG environment variable, and defaults to
     within the user_config location given by filename:basedir/3.

     On your system, the location is currently configured as:
       " ++ dialyzer_options:get_default_config_filename() ++
     "

     An example configuration file's contents might be:

       {incremental,
         {default_apps,[stdlib,kernel,erts]},
         {default_warning_apps,[stdlib]}
       }.
       {warnings, [no_improper_lists]}.
