-------------------------------
To add test cases in any suite:
-------------------------------

  1) If the test requires Dialyzer to analyze a single file (TEST.erl) place it
     in the suite's 'src' directory. If analysis of more files is needed place
     them all in a new directory (TEST) in suite's 'src' directory.

  2) Create a file named TEST containing the expected result in suite's 'result'
     directory.

----------------------
To create a new suite:
----------------------

  1) Create a directory with the suffix '_SUITE_data'. The name should
     describe the suite.

  2) In the suite's directory create subdirectories 'src' and 'results' as
     well as a 'dialyzer_options' file with the following content:

        {dialyzer_options, List}.
        {time_limit, Limit}.

        where:

        List  = a list of Dialyzer options. Common case will be something
                like [{warnings, Warnings}], where Warnings is a list of valid
                '-W' prefixed dialyzer options without the 'W' prefix (e.g.
                '-Wfoo' would be declared as [{warnings, [foo]}].
        Limit = the amount of time (in minutes) each test case is allowed to
                run. Must be greater than the time required to complete the most
                time-consuming test in the suite.
     
     Any of these lines may be missing. Default options list is empty and
     default time limit is 1 minute.

  3) Add tests as described in previous section.
