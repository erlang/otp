	    Fix server loop detection</p>
          <p>
	    Dialyzer does not normally emit warnings for functions
	    that implement non-terminating server loops. This
	    detection failed when some of the elements in an SCC
	    terminated normally (being for example list
	    comprehensions or other generic anonymous functions that
	    were included in the SCC). This patch fixes that.</p>

	    Add a proplist() type</p>
          <p>
	    Recently I was adding specs to an API and found that
	    there is no canonical proplist() type defined. (Thanks to
	    Ryan Zezeski)</p>

	    Suppress some warnings about generation of non-returning
	    funs</p>
          <p>
	    No warnings are emitted for funs that are non-returning
	    when the function that generates them has a contract that
	    specifies that it will return such a non-returning fun.</p>
          <p>
	    Enhance Dialyzer's inference on comparisons</p>
          <p>
	    This patch makes Dialyzer aware of Erlang's total
	    ordering of terms, enabling discrepancy detection in
	    cases where e.g. integer() &lt; tuple() is treated as a
	    comparison that might also return false (when it is
	    certain to always return true).</p>
          <p>
	    Minor fix in dead code</p>

	    Add a --fullpath option to Dialyzer</p>
          <p>
	    This change adds a --fullpath option to Dialyzer, which
	    makes the warning messages contain the full path of the
	    corresponding file.</p>
          <p>
	    Original patch submitted by Magnus Henoch (legoscia) on
	    15/9/2010 and cooked to death in the 'pu' branch all this
	    time.</p>
          <p>
	    The patch was essentially correct and most of it has been
	    used as is, but there have been some changes to make the
	    code slightly prettier, avoid some code duplication, and
	    add documentation to dialyzer's doc files and to its help
	    message.</p>

	    Fix warnings about guards containing not</p>
          <p>
	    The wording of warnings about unsatisfiable guards that
	    used 'not' was incorrect (the 'not' was not mentioned and
	    it appeared as "Guard test is_atom(atom()) can never
	    succeed") (thanks to Stavros Aronis).</p>

	    Version 2.4.2 (in Erlang/OTP R14B02)
	    ------------------------------------ - Added --fullpath
	    option to display files with warnings with their full
	    file names (thanks to Magnus Henoch for the original
	    patch). - Better handling of 'and'/'or'/'not' guards that
	    generate warnings (thanks to Stavros Aronis). - Better
	    blame assignment for cases when a function's spec is
	    erroneous (thanks to Stavros Aronis). - More descriptive
	    warnings when a tuple/record pattern contains subterms
	    that violate the declared types of record fields (thanks
	    to Matthias Lang for the test case and for Stavros Aronis
	    for the actual fix).</p>

          <p>
	    When testing Dialyzer it's important that several OTP
	    modules are included in the plt. The suites takes care of
	    that too.</p>

	    Various changes to dialyzer-related files for R14.</p>
          <p>
	    - Dialyzer properly supports the new attribute
	    -export_type and checks that remote types only refer to
	    exported types. A warning is produced if some
	    files/applications refer to types defined in modules
	    which are neither in the PLT nor in the analyzed
	    applications.</p>
          <p>
	    - Support for detecting data races involving whereis/1
	    and unregister/1.</p>
          <p>
	    - More precise identification of the reason(s) why a
	    record construction violates the types declared for its
	    fields.</p>
          <p>
	    - Fixed bug in the handling of the 'or' guard.</p>

	    <p>Added <c>--no_native</c> (<c>-nn</c>) option so that
	    the user can bypass the native code compilation that
	    dialyzer heuristically performs when dialyzing many
	    files.</p>

	    Dialyzer can statically detect some kinds of data races
	    in Erlang programs. Use the new option -Wrace_conditions
	    to enable the race analysis. The technique is described
	    in a paper which is available at:
	    http://www.it.uu.se/research/group/hipe/dialyzer/publications/races.pdf</p>
          <p>
	    Added support for packages (thanks to Maria Christakis).</p>
          <p>
	    There has been a major change in the default mode of
	    Dialyzer. Previously, the default mode was the GUI, while
	    now it is the command line. As a result of this change,
	    it is now possible to analyze a set of files/dirs with
	    the command: </p><list> <item>dialyzer file1 ...
	    fileN</item> </list><p> In other words, the -c
	    (--command-line) option is no longer necessary, though it
	    will be retained for some time for backwards
	    compatibility. To start dialyzer's GUI use either of the
	    following commands: </p><list> <item>dialyzer --gui %%
	    for the old gs-based GUI</item> <item>dialyzer --wx %%
	    for the new wx-based GUI (where available)</item>
	    </list><p></p>
          <p>
	    There is a new option --apps which allows the user to
	    easily refer to Erlang/OTP applications and include them
	    in the analysis or in the building of the PLT. For
	    example, we recommend building the PLT with: </p><list>
	    <item>dialyzer --build_plt --apps erts kernel stdlib
	    mnesia ...</item> </list><p></p>
          <p>
	    The new option can also take absolute file names as well
	    as applications. Note that the application versions that
	    will be included in the PLT are those that correspond to
	    the Erlang/OTP system which is used.</p>
          <p>
	    Dialyzer has a new wxWidgets based GUI (thanks to Elli
	    Frangaki) for platforms where the wx application is
	    available.</p>

    <section><title>Improvements and New Features</title>
      <list>
        <item>
	    <p>There is a major addition to the capabilities of
	    dialyzer, worthy of bumping the version number. Starting
	    with this version, dialyzer not only accepts but also
	    properly processes remote types (i.e., types of the form
	    ModuleName:TypeName()). Previous dialyzer versions only
	    accepted this notation in -type and -spec declarations,
	    but effectively ignored its information by mapping remote
	    types to the type any(). In contrast, starting with this
	    version, remote types are used in the analysis and are
	    also stored in the PLTs. (This addition changes the
	    format of PLTs and requires rebuilding any PLTs created
	    by an older dialyzer version.) Note that dialyzer will
	    complain and abort the analysis of a set of modules if it
	    needs to process a remote type without a definition
	    (either because the module does not include a definition
	    of the type or the module is not included in the
	    analysis). We may relax this restriction in a future
	    version.</p>
	    <p>Fixed minor issue with dialyzer:run/1 crashing (upon
	    its return) when used for adding type information to an
	    existing PLT.</p>
	    <p>Fixed minor but quite annoying issues in dialyzer's
	    GUI.</p>

	    <p>Fixed problem with type inference going into an

	    component of functions that do not return but also
	    contain an erroneous call which makes them fail and be
	    assigned the type none() instead of the type unit().</p>
	    <p>More accurate type information for some BIFs and
	    library files.</p>
	    <p>Introduced boolean() as the `official' name for the

        <item>
	    <p>The analysis accepts opaque type declarations and
	    detects violations of opaqueness of terms of such types.
	    Starting with R13, many Erlang/OTP standard libraries
	    (array, dict, digraph, ets, gb_sets, gb_trees, queue, and
	    sets) contain opaque type declarations of their main data
	    types. Dialyzer will spit out warnings in code that
	    explicitly depends on the structure of these terms.</p>
	    <p>Added support for handling UTF segments in bitstreams
	    and for detecting obvious type errors in these segments.
	    Warning: This code is not terribly tested though since
	    there are very few Erlang programs which use
	    Unicode-based binaries - not surprising since this is a
	    new language feature of R13.</p>
	    <p>Strengthened the discrepancy identification when
	    testing for equality and matching between terms of
	    different types. This detects more bugs in code.</p>
	    <p>Added warning for M:F(...) calls where M is not a
	    module term and F is not an atom. Previously, such calls
	    where found to fail but the reason for the failure was
	    not reported.</p>
	    <p>Added a convenient shorthand for the --no_check_plt
	    option (-n).</p>
	    <p>Added the --dump_callgraph option for dumping the
	    callgraph of all files that are analyzed into a specified
	    file. The callgraph either be dumped in raw format, in
	    .dot format, or converted to a .ps (postscript) file.
	    Note that in large callgraphs the generated postscript
	    file might not be interpretable by Ghostview. (Thanks to
	    Ilya Khlopotov for the initial version of this
	    functionality.)</p>

	    <p>Dialyzer's analysis is from now on exclusively based
	    on success typings. In particular, support for options
	    <c>--old_style</c> and <c>--dataflow</c> has been
	    discontinued.</p>
	    <p>Better and more aggressive handling of type
	    information in records.</p>
	    <p>Dialyzer has a new warning option
	    <c>-Wunmatched_returns</c> which warns for function calls
	    that ignore the return value. This catches many common
	    programming errors (e.g. calling <c>file:close/1</c> and
	    not checking for the absence of errors), interface
	    discrepancies (e.g. a function returning multiple values
	    when in reality the function is void and only called for
	    its side-effects), calling the wrong function (e.g.
	    <c>io_lib:format/1</c> instead of <c>io:format/1</c>),
	    and even possible performance defects (e.g. unnecessarily
	    constructing a list using a list comprehension instead of
	    using <c>lists:foreach/2</c>). Whenever a function
	    returns a single atomic value (e.g. 'ok' or pid()), the
	    warning is suppressed. This allows for "void" functions
	    (returning a single atom like 'ok') or for calls to
	    certain builtins like <c>spawn</c>. Because not all calls
	    which ignore the return value are discrepancies, the
	    option is off by default and has to be explicitly
	    requested by the user. But we recommend it
	    nevertheless.</p>
	    <p>Some warning options (<c>-Wno_comp</c>,
	    <c>-Wno_guards</c>, <c>-Wno_unsafe_beam</c>, etc.) which
	    could be used when analyzing bytecode produced by an old
	    BEAM compiler have been removed.</p>

          <p>Dialyzer can now use success typings to find
            discrepancies. As a consequence significantly more
            discrepancies are detected. The downside is that the
            analysis takes about 2 to 2.5 times longer than in
            previous versions, and may also result in some warnings
            that might be harder to interpret even though they are
            correct. This has been a major change, worth of
            increasing the version number.</p>
          <p>New command-line options:</p>
          <p>--succ_typings Use the success typings analysis.</p>
          <p>--dataflow (default) Use the previous analysis.</p>
          <p>The new type unit() has been introduced to handle the
            return type of non-terminating functions such as
            servers.</p>
          <p>Dialyzer's code server uses a compressed
            representation and the analysis requires significantly
            less memory than in previous versions.</p>

          <p>Dialyzer's building of PLT is based on a different
            type inference algorithm. More specifically, Dialyzer
            uses inference of refined success typings to infer
            function prototypes. As a result, Dialyzer bases its
            analysis on a significantly more powerful basis and thus
            is able to detect more discrepancies. The downside is
            that building the PLT is a considerably slower process.
            We will work on improving that.</p>
          <p>Dialyzer takes into account the BEAM compiler
            directive <c><![CDATA[-compile({nowarn_unused_function, {F,A}}).]]></c> and then suppresses the warning that
            function F/A will never be called.</p>
          <p>Dialyzer's default initial PLT now also includes
            "mnesia".</p>
