        <item>
	    <p> The translation of Erlang forms to the type
	    representation used by Dialyzer has been improved in
	    several ways. The most important change is that deeply
	    nested records can be handled. </p>
          <p>
	    Own Id: OTP-12350</p>
        </item>
        <item>
	    <p> Fix a bug that could cause bogus warnings for opaque
	    types. </p> <p>In Erlang/OTP 18 two parameterized types
	    declared in the same module always result in a
	    contradiction (<c>none()</c>) when combined outside of
	    the module where they are declared, unless they have the
	    same number of parameters. </p> <p> The behaviour is
	    different from Erlang/OTP 17 where, for instance,
	    <c>dict:dict()</c> and <c>dict:dict(_, _)</c>, which are
	    both opaque, can be combined outside of the <c>dict</c>
	    module. </p> <p> In Erlang/OTP 18, <c>dict:dict()</c> and
	    <c>dict:dict(_, _)</c> can still be combined outside of
	    the <c>dict</c> module. That has been made possible by
	    not declaring <c>dict:dict()</c> as opaque. </p>

	    <p> The <c>-dialyzer()</c> attribute can be used for
	    suppressing warnings in a module by specifying functions
	    or warning options. It can also be used for requesting
	    warnings in a module. </p>

	    <c>digraph()</c>, <c>gb_set()</c>, <c>gb_tree()</c>,
	    <c>queue()</c>, <c>set()</c>, and <c>tid()</c> have been

        <item>
	    <p> A few type names that have been used for representing
	    certain predefined types can now be used for user-defined
	    types. This affects the types <c>product/_</c>,
	    <c>union/_</c>, and <c>range/2</c> as well as
	    <c>tuple/N</c> (N > 0), <c>map/N</c> (N > 0),
	    <c>atom/1</c>, <c>integer/1</c>, <c>binary/2</c>,
	    <c>record/_,</c> and <c>'fun'/_</c>. A consequence is
	    that, for example, it is no longer possible to refer to a
	    record type with <c>record(r)</c>; instead the usual
	    record notation, <c>#r{}</c>, is to be used. </p>

        <item>
	    <p> When implementing user-defined behaviours it is now
	    possible to specify optional callback functions. See OTP
	    Design Principles User's Guide, Sys and Proc_Lib,
	    User-Defined Behaviours, for details. </p>

	    Own Id: OTP-11861</p>
        </item>
        <item>
	    <p>Add two options to the Dialyzer:
	    <c>no_missing_calls</c> suppresses warnings about calls
	    to missing or unexported functions; <c>unknown</c> lets
	    warnings about unknown functions or types affect the exit
	    status. See also dialyzer(3). </p>

	    Own Id: OTP-12682</p>
        </item>
        <item>
	    <p>By default, dialyzer will now cache native versions of
	    dialyzer modules to avoid having to re-compile them each
	    time dialyzer is started. Caching can be disabled using
	    the option <c>--no_native_cache</c>.</p>

	    17.1, has been corrected. (Thanks to Nicolas Dudebout for

	    <p> Dialyzer will no longer emit warnings when inspecting
	    or modifying opaque types within the scope of a module.
	    </p> <p> Hitherto the shape of terms (tuple, list, etc.)
	    has been used to determine the opaque terms, but now the
	    contracts are used for decorating types with opaqueness.

	    With <c>--Wunmatched_returns</c>, dialyzer will no longer
	    warn when the value of a list comprehension is ignored,
	    provided that the each value in the list would be an
	    atomic value (such as integer or atoms, as opposed to
	    tuples and lists). Example: ignoring '<c>[io:format(...)

	    Integrate elliptic curve contribution from Andreas
	    Schultz </p>
          <p>
	    In order to be able to support elliptic curve cipher
	    suites in SSL/TLS, additions to handle elliptic curve
	    infrastructure has been added to public_key and crypto.</p>
          <p>
	    This also has resulted in a rewrite of the crypto API to
	    gain consistency and remove unnecessary overhead. All OTP
	    applications using crypto has been updated to use the new
	    API.</p>
          <p>
	    Impact: Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) offers
	    equivalent security with smaller key sizes than other
	    public key algorithms. Smaller key sizes result in
	    savings for power, memory, bandwidth, and computational
	    cost that make ECC especially attractive for constrained
	    environments.</p>

	    Fix false warning about closure application</p>
          <p>
	    Whenever a variable that could hold one of two or more
	    possible closures was used in a particular application,
	    the application was assumed to fail if ONE of the
	    closures would fail in this application. This has been

          <p>

	    return _ but the inferred return is _", which are
	    actually underspecifications and not wrong type
	    specifications. This patch makes sure that they are filed

	    Dialyzer does not normally emit warnings for functions

	    for the actual fix).</p>

	    Various changes to dialyzer-related files for R14.</p>
          <p>
	    - Dialyzer properly supports the new attribute
	    -export_type and checks that remote types only refer to
	    exported types. A warning is produced if some
	    files/applications refer to types defined in modules
	    which are neither in the PLT nor in the analyzed
	    applications.</p>
          <p>
	    - Support for detecting data races involving whereis/1
	    and unregister/1.</p>
          <p>
	    - More precise identification of the reason(s) why a
	    record construction violates the types declared for its
	    fields.</p>
          <p>
	    - Fixed bug in the handling of the 'or' guard.</p>
          <p>
	    - Better handling of the erlang:element/2 BIF.</p>
          <p>

	    visible change is that the frames are removed.</p>

	    Dialyzer can statically detect some kinds of data races
	    in Erlang programs. Use the new option -Wrace_conditions
	    to enable the race analysis. The technique is described
	    in a paper which is available at:
	    http://www.it.uu.se/research/group/hipe/dialyzer/publications/races.pdf</p>
          <p>
	    Added support for packages (thanks to Maria Christakis).</p>
          <p>
	    There has been a major change in the default mode of
	    Dialyzer. Previously, the default mode was the GUI, while
	    now it is the command line. As a result of this change,
	    it is now possible to analyze a set of files/dirs with
	    the command: </p><list> <item>dialyzer file1 ...
	    fileN</item> </list><p> In other words, the -c
	    (--command-line) option is no longer necessary, though it
	    will be retained for some time for backwards
	    compatibility. To start dialyzer's GUI use either of the
	    following commands: </p><list> <item>dialyzer --gui %%
	    for the old gs-based GUI</item> <item>dialyzer --wx %%
	    for the new wx-based GUI (where available)</item>
	    </list><p></p>
          <p>
	    There is a new option --apps which allows the user to
	    easily refer to Erlang/OTP applications and include them
	    in the analysis or in the building of the PLT. For
	    example, we recommend building the PLT with: </p><list>
	    <item>dialyzer --build_plt --apps erts kernel stdlib
	    mnesia ...</item> </list><p></p>
          <p>
	    The new option can also take absolute file names as well
	    as applications. Note that the application versions that
	    will be included in the PLT are those that correspond to
	    the Erlang/OTP system which is used.</p>
          <p>
	    Dialyzer has a new wxWidgets based GUI (thanks to Elli
	    Frangaki) for platforms where the wx application is
	    available.</p>

	    <p>There is a major addition to the capabilities of
	    dialyzer, worthy of bumping the version number. Starting
	    with this version, dialyzer not only accepts but also
	    properly processes remote types (i.e., types of the form
	    ModuleName:TypeName()). Previous dialyzer versions only
	    accepted this notation in -type and -spec declarations,
	    but effectively ignored its information by mapping remote
	    types to the type any(). In contrast, starting with this
	    version, remote types are used in the analysis and are
	    also stored in the PLTs. (This addition changes the
	    format of PLTs and requires rebuilding any PLTs created
	    by an older dialyzer version.) Note that dialyzer will
	    complain and abort the analysis of a set of modules if it
	    needs to process a remote type without a definition
	    (either because the module does not include a definition
	    of the type or the module is not included in the
	    analysis). We may relax this restriction in a future
	    version.</p>
	    <p>Fixed minor issue with dialyzer:run/1 crashing (upon
	    its return) when used for adding type information to an
	    existing PLT.</p>
	    <p>Fixed minor but quite annoying issues in dialyzer's

	    contain an erroneous call which makes them fail and be
	    assigned the type none() instead of the type unit().</p>
	    <p>More accurate type information for some BIFs and
	    library files.</p>
	    <p>Introduced boolean() as the `official' name for the

	    <p>The analysis accepts opaque type declarations and
	    detects violations of opaqueness of terms of such types.
	    Starting with R13, many Erlang/OTP standard libraries
	    (array, dict, digraph, ets, gb_sets, gb_trees, queue, and
	    sets) contain opaque type declarations of their main data
	    types. Dialyzer will spit out warnings in code that
	    explicitly depends on the structure of these terms.</p>
	    <p>Added support for handling UTF segments in bitstreams
	    and for detecting obvious type errors in these segments.
	    Warning: This code is not terribly tested though since
	    there are very few Erlang programs which use
	    Unicode-based binaries - not surprising since this is a
	    new language feature of R13.</p>
	    <p>Strengthened the discrepancy identification when
	    testing for equality and matching between terms of
	    different types. This detects more bugs in code.</p>
	    <p>Added warning for M:F(...) calls where M is not a
	    module term and F is not an atom. Previously, such calls
	    where found to fail but the reason for the failure was
	    not reported.</p>
	    <p>Added a convenient shorthand for the --no_check_plt
	    option (-n).</p>
	    <p>Added the --dump_callgraph option for dumping the
	    callgraph of all files that are analyzed into a specified
	    file. The callgraph either be dumped in raw format, in
	    .dot format, or converted to a .ps (postscript) file.
	    Note that in large callgraphs the generated postscript
	    file might not be interpretable by Ghostview. (Thanks to
	    Ilya Khlopotov for the initial version of this
	    functionality.)</p>

	    <p>Dialyzer's analysis is from now on exclusively based
	    on success typings. In particular, support for options

	    discontinued.</p>
	    <p>Better and more aggressive handling of type
	    information in records.</p>
	    <p>Dialyzer has a new warning option
	    <c>-Wunmatched_returns</c> which warns for function calls
	    that ignore the return value. This catches many common
	    programming errors (e.g. calling <c>file:close/1</c> and
	    not checking for the absence of errors), interface
	    discrepancies (e.g. a function returning multiple values
	    when in reality the function is void and only called for
	    its side-effects), calling the wrong function (e.g.
	    <c>io_lib:format/1</c> instead of <c>io:format/1</c>),
	    and even possible performance defects (e.g. unnecessarily
	    constructing a list using a list comprehension instead of
	    using <c>lists:foreach/2</c>). Whenever a function
	    returns a single atomic value (e.g. 'ok' or pid()), the
	    warning is suppressed. This allows for "void" functions
	    (returning a single atom like 'ok') or for calls to
	    certain builtins like <c>spawn</c>. Because not all calls
	    which ignore the return value are discrepancies, the
	    option is off by default and has to be explicitly
	    requested by the user. But we recommend it
	    nevertheless.</p>
	    <p>Some warning options (<c>-Wno_comp</c>,
	    <c>-Wno_guards</c>, <c>-Wno_unsafe_beam</c>, etc.) which

          <p>Dialyzer can now use success typings to find
            discrepancies. As a consequence significantly more
            discrepancies are detected. The downside is that the

            previous versions, and may also result in some warnings
            that might be harder to interpret even though they are
            correct. This has been a major change, worth of
            increasing the version number.</p>

          <p>Dialyzer's building of PLT is based on a different
            type inference algorithm. More specifically, Dialyzer
            uses inference of refined success typings to infer
            function prototypes. As a result, Dialyzer bases its
            analysis on a significantly more powerful basis and thus
            is able to detect more discrepancies. The downside is
            that building the PLT is a considerably slower process.
            We will work on improving that.</p>
          <p>Dialyzer takes into account the BEAM compiler
            directive <c><![CDATA[-compile({nowarn_unused_function, {F,A}}).]]></c> and then suppresses the warning that

        <item>
          <p>Dialyzer is significantly (approx 40%) faster since it now uses 'ets'
            rather than 'dets' for its PLT.</p>

        <item>
          <p>Slightly improved the precision of the analysis.</p>

        <item>
          <p>In the GUI version, Dialyzer now reports the list of modules that should
            be included in the modules to analyze in order to possibly improve
            the accuracy of the reported results.</p>

        <item>
          <p>Added -q option which makes the command-line version of Dialyzer

    <title>Dialyzer 1.2.0</title>

    <section>
      <title>Improvements and New Features</title>
      <list type="bulleted">
        <item>
          <p>Dialyzer works with the open source and commercial versions of Erlang/OTP
            R10B-2 on all platforms (i.e., HiPE support is not a prerequisite anymore).</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>Whenever a .beam file contains abstract code (i.e., has been compiled
            with the +debug_info option), the analysis starts from this code rather
            than from BEAM bytecode -- this makes the results identical to those
            obtained by analysis starting from source code.
            (This is a contribution from Bjorn Gustavsson - Thanks!)</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>Added -pa command line option for easier handling of -include_lib()
            directives in source code.</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>Includes all changes added in v1.1.1; see below.  The "Add Recursively"
            functionality is also available in the command-line mode (-r option).</p>

        <item>
          <p>Dialyzer works with the open source version of Erlang/OTP R10B-1 (on
            platforms where HiPE support is available) and it does not require
            installation of a customized Erlang/OTP system anymore.</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>Dialyzer comes with an extensive command-line interface, in addition
            to an enhanced GUI.</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>Analysis can start from source code (through Core Erlang) as well as

        </item>
        <item>
          <p>Dialyzer finds considerably more discrepancies in Erlang code than
            previous versions.</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>Added ability to selectively turn on/off different warning categories.</p>

        <item>
          <p>Fixed major bug of v1.0.0 which caused the analysis to stop prematurely
            (i.e., without properly reaching fixpoint) when analyzing more than one
            module.  This did not affect correctness of the results, but lost many
            opportunities to detect discrepancies.</p>

        <item>
          <p>Initial Dialyzer version: Analysis starts from BEAM bytecode only and 
            only a GUI version is available. Dialyzer reports discrepancies in the
            use of the "sequential" part of Erlang. To be used, Dialyzer requires
            the presence of a specific snapshot of Erlang/OTP which can be obtained
            from Dialyzer's homepage.</p>
