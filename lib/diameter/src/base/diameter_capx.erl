%% This module builds CER and CEA records for use during capabilities
%% exchange. All of a CER/CEA is built from AVP values configured on
%% the service in question but values for Supported-Vendor-Id,
%% Vendor-Specific-Application-Id, Auth-Application-Id and
%% Acct-Application-id are also obtained using an older method that
%% remains only for backwards compatibility. With this method, each
%% dictionary module was required to export a cer/0 that returned a
%% diameter_base_CER record (or corresponding list, although the list
%% is also a later addition). Each returned CER contributes its member
%% values for the aforementioned four AVPs to the resulting CER, with
%% remaining AVP's either unspecified or identical to those configured
%% on the service. Auth-Application-Id and Acct-Application-id were
%% originally treated a little differently, each callback being
%% required to return either no value of the same value as the other
%% callbacks, but this coupled the callback modules unnecessarily. (A
%% union is backwards compatible to boot.)
%%
%% Values obtained from the service and callbacks are all included
%% when building a CER. Older code with only callback can continue to
%% use them, newer code should probably stick to service configuration
%% (since this is more explicit) or mix at their own peril.
%%
%% The cer/0 callback is now undocumented (despite never being fully
%% documented to begin with) and should be considered deprecated even
%% by those poor souls still using it.

%% rCER/2
%%
%% Build a CEA record to send to a remote peer in response to an
%% incoming CER. RFC 3588 gives no guidance on what should be sent
%% here: should we advertise applications that the peer hasn't sent in
%% its CER (aside from the relay application) or not? If we send
%% applications that the peer hasn't advertised then the peer may have
%% to be aware of the possibility. If we don't then we just look like
%% a server that supports a subset (possibly) of what the client
%% advertised, so this feels like the path of least incompatibility.
%% However, the current draft standard (draft-ietf-dime-rfc3588bis-26,
%% expires 24 July 2011) says this in section 5.3, Capabilities
%% Exchange:
%%
%%   The receiver of the Capabilities-Exchange-Request (CER) MUST
%%   determine common applications by computing the intersection of its
%%   own set of supported Application Id against all of the application
%%   identifier AVPs (Auth-Application-Id, Acct-Application-Id and Vendor-
%%   Specific-Application-Id) present in the CER.  The value of the
%%   Vendor-Id AVP in the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id MUST NOT be used
%%   during computation.  The sender of the Capabilities-Exchange-Answer
%%   (CEA) SHOULD include all of its supported applications as a hint to
%%   the receiver regarding all of its application capabilities.
%%
%% Both RFC and the draft also say this:
%%
%%   The receiver only issues commands to its peers that have advertised
%%   support for the Diameter application that defines the command.  A
%%   Diameter node MUST cache the supported applications in order to
%%   ensure that unrecognized commands and/or AVPs are not unnecessarily
%%   sent to a peer.
%%
%% That is, each side sends all of its capabilities and is responsible for
%% not sending commands that the peer doesn't support.

%% 6.10.  Inband-Security-Id AVP
%%
%%   NO_INBAND_SECURITY                0
%%      This peer does not support TLS.  This is the default value, if the

%%
%%   TLS                               1
%%      This node supports TLS security, as defined by [TLS].
