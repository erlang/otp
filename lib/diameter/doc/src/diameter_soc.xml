<p>
The table below summarizes the diameter application's compliance with
&the_rfc;.
Since the diameter application isn't a Diameter node on its own,
compliance is strictly the responsibility of the user in many cases,
diameter providing the means for the user to be compliant
rather than being compliant on its own.</p>

<p>
The Compliance column notes <em>C</em> (Compliant) if the required
functionality is implemented, <em>PC</em> (Partially Compliant) if
there are limitations, <em>NC</em> (Not Compliant) if functionality is
not implemented, or a dash if text is informational or only places
requirements that must be met by the user's implementation.</p>

<p>
Capitalized <em>Diameter</em> refers to the protocol, lowercase
<em>diameter</em> to the Erlang application.</p>

  Ready dictionaries are provided for the &the_rfc; common message, base

  <cell>&NA;</cell>
  <cell>Session state is the responsibility of the user.&BR;
  The role of a Diameter node is determined by the user's
  implementation.</cell>
</row>
<row>
  <cell>2.1</cell>
  <cell>Transport</cell>
  <cell>PC</cell>
  <cell>Ports are configured by the user: diameter places no
  restrictions.&BR;
  The transport interface documented in &man_transport;
  allows the user to implement their own methods.
  Ready support is provided for TCP, TCP/TLS, and SCTP, but not
  DTLS/SCTP.&BR;
  Multiple connections to the same peer is possible.
  ICMP messages are not interpreted.</cell>
</row>
<row>
  <cell>2.1.1</cell>
  <cell>SCTP Guidelines</cell>
  <cell>C</cell>
  <cell>Unordered sending is configurable in &man_sctp;.
  There is no special handling of DPR/DPA: since a user that cares
  about pending answers should wait for them before initiating
  DPR.&BR;
  A PPID can be configured with a a gen_sctp sctp_default_send_param
  option.</cell>

  <cell>As documented, the election assumes knowledge of a peer's
  DiameterIdentity when initiating a connection, which diameter
  doesn't require. Connections will be accepted if configuration
  allows multiple connections per peer to be established or there is
  no existing connection. Note that the election process is only
  applicable when multiple connections per peer is
  disallowed.</cell>
