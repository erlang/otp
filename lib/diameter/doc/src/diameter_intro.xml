<p>
The diameter application is an implementation of the Diameter protocol
as defined by &the_rfc;.
It supports arbitrary Diameter applications by way of a
<em>dictionary</em> interface that allows messages and AVPs to be
defined and input into diameter as configuration.
It has support for all roles defined in the RFC: client, server and
agent.
This chapter provides a short overview of the application.</p>

<p>
A Diameter node is implemented by configuring a <em>service</em> and
one or more <em>transports</em> using the interface module
<seealso marker="diameter">diameter</seealso>.
The service configuration defines the Diameter applications to be
supported by the node and, typically, the capabilities that it should
send to remote peers at capabilities exchange upon the establishment
of transport connections.
A transport is configured on a service and provides protocol-specific
send/receive functionality by way of a transport interface defined by
diameter and implemented by a transport module.
The diameter application provides two transport modules: <seealso
marker="diameter_tcp">diameter_tcp</seealso> and <seealso
marker="diameter_sctp">diameter_sctp</seealso> for transport over TCP
(using <seealso marker="kernel:gen_tcp">gen_tcp</seealso>) and SCTP
(using <seealso marker="kernel:gen_sctp">gen_sctp</seealso>) respectively.
Other transports can be provided by any module that implements
diameter's <seealso marker="diameter_transport">transport
interface</seealso>.</p>

<p>
While a service typically implements a single Diameter node (as
identified by an Origin-Host AVP), transports can themselves be
associated with capabilities AVPs so that a single service can be
used to implement more than one Diameter node.</p>

<p>
Each Diameter application defined on a service is configured with a
callback module that implements the <seealso
marker="diameter_app">application interface</seealso> through which
diameter communicates the connectivity of remote peers, requests peer
selection for outgoing requests, and communicates the reception of
incoming Diameter request and answer messages.
An application using diameter implements these application callback
modules to provide the functionality of the Diameter node(s) it
implements.</p>

<p>
Each Diameter application is also configured with a
dictionary module
that provide encode/decode functionality for outgoing/incoming
Diameter messages belonging to the application.
A dictionary module is generated from a <seealso
marker="diameter_dict">dictionary file</seealso> using the <seealso
marker="diameterc">diameterc</seealso> utility.
Dictionaries for the &the_rfc; Diameter Common Messages, Base
Accounting and Relay applications are provided with the diameter
application.</p>
