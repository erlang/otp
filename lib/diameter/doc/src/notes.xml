	    Fix faulty handling of Origin-State-Id and faulty config
	    values.</p>
          <p>
	    The former was expected in a list despite the
	    documentation requiring (correctly) an integer. A bare
	    value for a list-valued capability was not handled.</p>

	    Fix timing of up/down events.</p>
          <p>
	    Previously, a call to diameter:call/4 following a peer_up
	    callback might incorrectly return {error, no_connection},
	    depending on timing. Both events now follow the
	    corresponding callbacks.</p>

          <p>
	    Except for in pick_peer when {call_mutates_state, false},
	    it would previously hang indefinitely.</p>

	    Let prepare_request, prepare_retransmit and

          <p>
	    Whether or not DPR should be sent at application stop,

	    Fix broken Result-Code setting and Destination-Host/Realm

          <p>
	    Result-Code was assumed to have arity 1 when setting this

	    Handle insufficient capabilities configuration more
	    gracefully.</p>
          <p>
	    A transport that does not have sufficient capabilities
	    configuration in order to encode CER/CEA will now emit an
	    error report noting the configuration error and exit
	    instead of failing. The error is not detected at
	    diameter:add_transport/2 since there is no requirement
	    that a service be configured before its transports.</p>

          <p>
	    Multiple values are attempted in sequence until one

	    Add support for TLS over TCP.</p>
          <p>
	    RFC 3588 requires that a Diameter server support TLS. In
	    practice this seems to mean TLS over SCTP since there are
	    limitations with running over SCTP: see RFC 6083 (DTLS
	    over SCTP), which is a response to RFC 3436 (TLS over
	    SCTP). The current RFC 3588 draft acknowledges this by
	    equating TLS with TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP.</p>
          <p>
	    TLS handshaking can take place either following a CER/CEA
	    that negotiates TLS using the Inband-Security-Id AVP (the
	    method documented in RFC 3588) or immediately following
	    connection establishment (the method added to the current
	    draft).</p>

	    Improvements to the dictionary parser.</p>
          <p>
	    The dictionary parser now emits useful error messages in
	    case of faults in the input file, also identifying the
	    line number at which the fault was detected. There are
	    semantic checks that were missing in the previous parser,
	    a fault in the interpretation of vendor id's in
	    combination with @inherits has been fixed and @end can be
	    used to terminate parsing explicitly instead of always
	    parsing to end of file.</p>

	    Improve dictionary reusability.</p>
          <p>
	    Reusing a dictionary just to get a different generated
	    module name or prefix previously required taking a copy
	    of the source, which may consist of several files if
	    inheritance is used, just to edit a couple of lines which
	    don't affect the semantics of the Diameter application
	    being defined. Options --name, --prefix and --inherits
	    have been added to diameterc to allow corresponding
	    values to be set at compile time.</p>

	    Add capabilities_cb transport option.</p>
          <p>
	    Its value is a function that's applied to the transport
	    reference and capabilities record after capabilities
	    exchange. If a callback returns anything but 'ok' then
	    the connection is closed. In the case of an incoming CER,
	    the callback can return a result code with which to
	    answer. Multiple callbacks can be specified and are
	    applied until either all return 'ok' or one doesn't.</p>
          <p>
	    This provides a way to reject a peer connection.</p>

	    Add @codecs to dictionary format.</p>
          <p>
	    The semantics are similar to @custom_types but results in
	    codec functions of the form TypeName(encode|decode,
	    AvpName, Data) rather than AvpName(encode|decode,
	    TypeName, Data). That is, the role of the AVP name and
	    Diameter type name are reversed. This eliminates the need
	    for exporting one function for each AVP sharing a common
	    specialized encode/decode.</p>

	    @id required in dictionary files only when @messages is

          <p>
	    @id defines an application identifier and this is used

Some agent-related functionality is not entirely complete.
In particular, support for proxy agents, that advertise specific
Diameter applications but otherwise relay messages in much the same
way as relay agents (for which a handle_request
callback can return a <c>relay</c> tuple), will be completed in an
upcoming release.
There may also be more explicit support for redirect agents, although
redirect behaviour can be implemented with the current
functionality.</p>

There is some asymmetry in the treatment of messages sent as
<c>diameter_header/avp</c> records and those sent in the "normal"
fashion, and not all of this is documented.
This is related to the previous point since this form of sending a
message was introduced specifically to handle relay agent behaviour
using the same callback interface as for client/server behaviour.</p>

The User's Guide is currently quite thin.
The introductory chapter followed by the examples (in the application
<c>examples</c> subdirectory) may be sufficient
for those having some familiarity with the Diameter protocol but the
intention is to provide more introductory text.
The reference documentation is quite complete, although some points
could likely be expanded upon.</p>

<p>
The function diameter:service_info/2
can be used to retrieve information about a started service
(statistics, information about connected peers, etc) but
this is not yet documented and both the input and output may change
in the next release.</p>
