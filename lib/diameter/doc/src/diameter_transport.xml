<modulesummary>Diameter transport interface.</modulesummary>

<description>

<p>
A module specified as a <c>transport_module</c> to &mod_add_transport;
must implement the interface documented here.
The interface consists of a function with which
diameter starts a transport process and a message interface with which
the transport process communicates with the process that starts it (aka its
parent).</p>

<marker id="message"/>

<tag><c>message() = binary() | &codec_packet;</c></tag>
<item>
<p>
A Diameter message as passed over the transport interface.</p>

<p>
For an inbound message from a transport process, a &codec_packet; must
contain the received message in its <c>bin</c> field.
In the case of an inbound request, any value set in the
<c>transport_data</c> field will passed back to the transport module
in the corresponding answer message, unless the sender supplies
another value.</p>

<p>
For an outbound message to a transport process, a &codec_packet; has a
value other than <c>undefined</c> in its <c>transport_data</c> field
and has the binary() to send in its <c>bin</c> field.</p>

<p>
Start a transport process.
Called by diameter as a consequence of a call to &mod_add_transport; in
order to establish or accept a transport connection respectively.
A transport process maintains a connection with a single remote peer.</p>

<p>
<c>Type</c> indicates whether the transport process in question
is being started for a connecting (<c>Type=connect</c>) or listening
(<c>Type=accept</c>) transport.
In the latter case, transport processes are started as required to
accept connections from multiple peers.</p>

<p>
Ref is the value that was returned from the call to &mod_add_transport;
that has lead to starting of a transport process.</p>

<p>
<c>Svc</c> contains capabilities passed to &mod_start_service; and
&mod_add_transport;, values passed to the latter overriding those
passed to the former.</p>

<p>
<c>Config</c> is as passed in <c>transport_config</c> tuple in the
&mod_transport_opt; list passed to &mod_add_transport;.</p>

<p>
The start function should use the <c>Host-IP-Address</c> list in
<c>Svc</c> and/or <c>Config</c> to select and return an appropriate
list of local IP addresses.
In the connecting case, the local address list can instead be
communicated in a <c>connected</c> message (see &MESSAGES; below)
following connection establishment.
In either case, the local address list is used to populate
<c>Host-IP-Address</c> AVPs in outgoing capabilities exchange
messages if <c>Host-IP-Address</c> is unspecified.</p>

<p>
A transport process must implement the message interface documented below.
It should retain the pid of its parent, monitor the parent and terminate if
it dies.
It should not link to the parent.
It should exit if its transport connection with its peer is lost.</p>

<section>
<title>MESSAGES</title>

<p>
All messages sent over the transport interface are of the
form <c>{diameter, term()}</c>.</p>

<p>
A transport process can expect messages of the following types from
its parent.</p>

<taglist>

<tag><c>{diameter, {send, &message;}}</c></tag>
<item>
<p>
An outbound Diameter message.</p>
</item>

<tag><c>{diameter, {close, Pid}}</c></tag>
<item>
<p>
A request to terminate the transport process after having received DPA
in response to DPR.
The transport process should exit.
<c>Pid</c> is the pid() of the parent process.</p>
</item>

<tag><c>{diameter, {tls, Ref, Type, Bool}}</c></tag>
<item>
<p>
Indication of whether or not capabilities exchange has selected
inband security using TLS.
<c>Ref</c> is a reference() that must be included in the
<c>{diameter, {tls, Ref}}</c> reply message to the transport's
parent process (see below).
<c>Type</c> is either <c>connect</c> or <c>accept</c> depending on
whether the process has been started for a connecting or listening
transport respectively.
<c>Bool</c> is a boolean() indicating whether or not the transport
connection should be upgraded to TLS.</p>

<p>
If TLS is requested (<c>Bool=true</c>) then a connecting process should
initiate a TLS handshake with the peer and an accepting process should
prepare to accept a handshake.
A successful handshake should be followed by a <c>{diameter, {tls, Ref}}</c>
message to the parent process.
A failed handshake should cause the process to exit.</p>

<p>
This message is only sent to a transport process over whose
<c>Inband-Security-Id</c> configuration has indicated support for
TLS.</p>
</item>

</taglist>

<p>
A transport process should send messages of the following types
to its parent.</p>

<taglist>

<tag><c>{diameter, {self(), connected}}</c></tag>
<item>
<p>
Inform the parent that the transport process with <c>Type=accept</c> has
established a connection with the peer.
Not sent if the transport process has <c>Type=connect</c>.</p>
</item>

<tag><c>{diameter, {self(), connected, Remote}}</c></tag>
<tag><c>{diameter, {self(), connected, Remote, [LocalAddr]}}</c></tag>
<item>
<p>
Inform the parent that the transport process with <c>Type=connect</c>
has established a connection with a peer.
Not sent if the transport process has <c>Type=accept</c>.&nbsp;
<c>Remote</c> is an arbitrary term that uniquely identifies the remote
endpoint to which the transport has connected.
A <c>LocalAddr</c> list has the same semantics as one returned from
&start;.</p>
</item>

<tag><c>{diameter, {recv, &message;}}</c></tag>
<item>
<p>
An inbound Diameter message.</p>
</item>

<tag><c>{diameter, {tls, Ref}}</c></tag>
<item>
<p>
Acknowledgment of a successful TLS handshake.
<c>Ref</c> is the reference() received in the
<c>{diameter, {tls, Ref, Type, Bool}}</c> message in response
to which the reply is sent.
A transport must exit if a handshake is not successful.</p>
</item>
