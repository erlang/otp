  <h2>Information pages</h2>

    <p>Each menu item points to an information page. If no information
    is found for an item, the page will simply say "No information
    found". The reason for not finding any information about an item
    can be that the dump is truncated, that it is a dump from an old
    OTP release in which this item was not written or that the item
    simply wasn't present in the system at the point of failure.

    <p>If the dump was truncated, a warning is displayed.

    <p>Even if some information about an item exists, there might be
    empty fields if the dump originates from an old OTP release.

    <p>The value "-1" in any field means "unknown", and in most cases
    it means that the dump was truncated somewhere around this field.

    <p>Only some of the fields in the different information pages are
    described here. These are fields that to not exist in the raw
    crashdump, or in some way differs from the fields in the raw
    crashdump. Details about other field can be found in the user's
    guide for the Erlang runtime system, in the chapter "How to
    interpret the Erlang crash dumps". A link to this chapter can be
    found in the Crashdump Viewer's menu under documentation, and
    there are also direct links from the specific sections below to
    related information in "How to interpret the Erlang crash dumps".

    <a NAME="general_info">
    <h3>General information</h3>
	
      <p>This is the first page shown when a new dump is loaded into
      the system. It shows a very short overview of the dump.

      <p>'Node name' will only exist in dumps originating from OTP R9C
      and later. 

      <p>The following fields are not described in the Erlang runtime
      system user's guide:

      <dl>
	<dt><strong>Crashdump created on</strong></dt>
	<dd>Time of failure.</dd>

	<dt><strong>Memory allocated</strong></dt>
	<dd>The total number of bytes allocated, equivalent to
	<code>c:memory(total)</code>. This will only be present in
	dumps from OTP R9C and later.</dd>

	<dt><strong>Memory maximum</strong></dt>
	<dd>The maximum number of bytes that has been allocated
	during the lifetime of the originating node. This will not be
	present in dumps older than OTP R9C, and even in newer
	releases it is only shown if the Erlang runtime system was run
	instrumented.</dd>

	<dt><strong>Atoms</strong></dt>
	<dd>If at all available in the dump, this is the total
	number of atoms in the atom table. If the size of the atom
	table is not available, the number of atoms visible in the
	dump is presented.</dd>

	<dt><strong>Processes, ETS tables and Funs</strong></dt>
	<dd>The number of processes, ETS tables and funs visible in
	the dump.</dd>
      </dl>

    <a NAME="processes">
    <h3>Processes</h3>
	
      <p>The Process Information page shows a list of all processes
      found in the crashdump, including some short information about
      each process. By default the processes are sorted by their
      pids. To sort by other topic, click any heading in the process
      table.

      <p>Detailed information about a specific process is shown when
      the pid is clicked.

    <a NAME="ports">
    <h3>Ports</h3>
      
      <p>The port information page shows all port information found in
      the dump.

     <center>
       <a href=/crashdump_erts_doc/crash_dump.html#ports>
       More...</a>
     </center>

    

    <a NAME="ets_tables"><a NAME="internal_ets_tables">
    <h3>ETS tables</h3>

      <p>The ETS table information page shows all ETS table
      information found in the dump. The 'Id' is the same as the
      'Table' field found in the raw crashdump, and 'Memory' is the
      'Words' field from the raw crashdump translated into
      bytes. 'Type' is the type of table, and it can be either "hash"
      or "tree". For tree tables there will be no value in the
      'Bucket' field.

      <p>Clicking a pid in the 'Owner' column takes you to the
      detailed information about the process owning the ETS table.

     <center>
       <a href=/crashdump_erts_doc/crash_dump.html#ets_tables>
       More...</a>
     </center>


    <a NAME="timers">
    <h3>Timers</h3>

      <p>The timer information page shows all timer information found
      in the dump.

      <p>Clicking a pid in the 'Owner' column takes you to the
      detailed information about the process owning the timer.

     <center>
       <a href=/crashdump_erts_doc/crash_dump.html#timers>
       More...</a>
     </center>



    <a NAME="funs">
    <h3>Fun table</h3>

      <p>The Fun table information page shows all Fun information
      found in the dump. Fun information will only exist in dumps from
      OTP R8B or later.

     <center>
       <a href=/crashdump_erts_doc/crash_dump.html#funs>
       More...</a>
     </center>

    

    <a NAME="atoms">
    <h3>Atoms</h3>

      <p>The atoms information page lists all atoms found in the
      dump. The last created atom is listed first.

      <p>Note that if the dump is from OTP R8B or earlier, the raw
      dump lists the atoms in the opposite order and the Crashdump
      Viewer reverses them. This means that there is no problem if the
      dump is not truncated. However, if the dump is truncated, the
      last atoms might not be shown at all!!

     <center>
       <a href=/crashdump_erts_doc/crash_dump.html#atoms>
       More...</a>
     </center>


    <a NAME="distribution_info">
    <h3>Distribution information</h3>

      <p>The distribution information page shows all distribution
      information found in the dump.

      <p>If the page shows "Not alive", it means that the node was not
      distributed.

      <p>It the node was distributed, all connected nodes are
      shown. Visible nodes are alive nodes with a living connection to
      the originating node. Hidden nodes are the same as visible
      nodes, except they are started with the "-hidden" flag. Not
      connected nodes are nodes that are not connected to the
      originating node anymore, but references (i.e. process or port
      identitifiers) exist.

      <p>'Links/Monitors' may contain information about links or
      monitors between processes on the originating node and the
      connected node.

      <p>'Extra Info' may contain debug information (i.e. special
      information written if the emulator is debug compiled) or error
      information.

    <a NAME="loaded_modules">
    <h3>Loaded modules</h3>

      <p>The loaded modules information page shows all modules that
      were loaded on the originating node, and the current size of the
      code. If old code exsits, the old size is also shown.

      <p>Detailed information about a specific module is shown when
      the module name is clicked.

     <center>
       <a href=/crashdump_erts_doc/crash_dump.html#loaded_modules>
       More...</a>
     </center>


    <a NAME="internal_tables">
    <h3>Internal tables</h3>

      <p>Internal tables are shown in two information pages: hash
      tables and index tables.

     <center>
       <a href=/crashdump_erts_doc/crash_dump.html#internal_tables>
       More...</a>
     </center>


    <a NAME="memory">
    <h3>Memory</h3>

      <p>Memory information is divided into three pages.

      <p>The first page, <strong>Memory</strong>, shows information
      similar to what you can obtain on a living node with
      <code>c:memory()</code>. This will only be present in dumps from
      OTP R9C and later.  
      <a href=/crashdump_erts_doc/crash_dump.html#memory>More...</a>

      <p>The <strong>Allocated areas</strong> page shows information
      similar to what you can obtain on a living node with
      <code>erlang:system_info(allocated_areas)</code>. 
      <a href=/crashdump_erts_doc/crash_dump.html#allocated_areas>More...</a>

      <p>The <strong>Allocator information</strong> page shows
      information about allocators. The contents of the page will vary
      with the version. 
      <a href=/crashdump_erts_doc/crash_dump.html#allocator>More...</a>

    <h3>Documentation</h3>

      <p>'Crashdump Viewer help' is this document.

      <p>'How to interpret Erlang crashdumps' is a document from the
      Erlang runtime system describing details in the raw
      crashdumps. Here you will also find information about each
      single field in the different information pages.
