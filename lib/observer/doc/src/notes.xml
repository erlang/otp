          <p>
	    <list> <item>A one-command trace setup is added,
	    <c>ttb:start_trace/4</c>.</item> <item>The following new
	    options are added to <c>ttb:tracer/2</c>: <list>
	    <item><em><c>shell</c></em> - Show trace messages on the
	    console in real time</item> <item><em><c>timer</c></em> -
	    Time constrained tracing</item>

	    file trace port buffers with given frequency</item>
	    <item><em><c>resume</c></em> - Automatically resume
	    tracing after node restart</item> </list> </item> <item>
	    A new shortcut is added for common tracer settings
	    similar to using the <c>dbg</c> module directly,
	    <c>ttb:tracer(shell | dbg)</c>. </item> <item> Some
	    shortcuts are added for commonly used match
	    specifications in <c>ttb:tp</c> and <c>ttb:tpl</c>.
	    </item> <item> The <c>Options</c> argument to functions
	    <c>ttb:tracer</c>, <c>ttb:write_config</c>,
	    <c>ttb:stop</c> and <c>ttb:format</c> may now be one
	    single option instead of a list. </item> <item> The
	    history buffer of the last trace is now always
	    automatically dumped to the file <c>ttb_last_config</c>
	    when <c>ttb:stop</c> is called. </item> <item> The
	    following new options are added to <c>ttb:stop/1</c>:
	    <list> <item><em><c>fetch_dir</c></em> - Specify where to
	    store fetched logs</item>
	    <item><em><c>{format,FormatOpts}</c></em> - Specify
	    options to use when formatting the fetched logs</item>
	    <item><em><c>return_fetch_dir</c></em> - Indicate that
	    the return value from <c>ttb:stop/1</c> should include
	    the name of the directory where the fetched logs are
	    stored</item> </list> </item> <item> The option
	    <c>disable_sort</c> is added to <c>ttb:format/2</c>. When
	    this option is used, trace messages from different logs
	    are not merged according to timestamps, but just appended
	    one log after the other. </item> </list></p>

	    The following non backwards compatible changes are done
	    in <c>ttb</c>:</p>
          <p>
	    <list> <item> When setting up trace with ttb, the
	    'timestamp' trace flag will now always be set. </item>
	    <item> The 'fetch' option to ttb:stop/1 is removed since
	    it is now default behavior that trace logs are fetched
	    when stopping ttb. Fetching can be disabled with the
	    'nofetch' option to ttb:stop/1. </item> <item> The name
	    of the upload directory is changed from
	    ttb_upload-Timestamp to ttb_upload_FileName-Timestamp.
	    </item> <item> To format the output using 'et', you now
	    need to provide the option {handler,ttb:get_et_handler()}
	    instead of {handler,et}. </item> <item> When formatting a
	    trace log, the handler state was earlier reset after each
	    trace file, this is now changed so the handler state is
	    passed not only from one trace message to the next in the
	    same file, but also from one file to the next. </item>
	    </list></p>

	    The time needed for loading a crashump into the crashdump
	    viewer would earlier grow exponentially with the size of
	    the crashdump file. Reading a file of 20M would take a
	    couple of minutes, and for a dump of 250M it would take
	    between 1 and 2 hours. This has been solved.</p>
          <p>
	    Earlier, all processes, timers, funs or ets-tables would
	    be loaded into the memory of the crashdump viewer node
	    before sending it on to the web server. This has been
	    changed and the pages are now sent to the web server in
	    chunks.</p>
          <p>
	    A security function in newer web browsers prevents a full
	    file path to be sent from an HTML file input field, i.e.
	    the field needed to implement the "Browse" button when
	    loading a file into the crashdump viewer. To overcome
	    this, the file input field is no longer used. Instead a
	    normal text input field is used, and the user needs to
	    manually insert the complete file path. For convenience,
	    a shell script and a batch file are added to the observer
	    application. These can be used to start the
	    crashdump_viewer and a browser and load a file - with the
	    file name given from the command line. The shell script
	    and batch file are called cdv and cdv.bat respectively,
	    and can be found in the priv dir of the observer
	    application.</p>

          <p>
	    Major improvements of the Erlang distribution for Erlang
	    runtime systems with SMP support. Previously distribution
	    port locks were heavily contended, and all encoding and
	    decoding for a specific distribution channel had to be
	    done in sequence. Lock contention due to the distribution
	    is now negligible and both encoding and decoding of
	    Erlang messages can be done in parallel.</p>
          <p>
	    The old atom cache protocol used by the Erlang
	    distribution has been dropped since it effectively
	    prevented all parallel encoding and decoding of messages
	    passed over the same distribution channel.</p>
          <p>
	    A new atom cache protocol has been introduced which
	    isolates atom cache accesses and makes parallel encoding
	    and decoding of messages passed over the same
	    distribution channel possible. The new atom cache
	    protocol also use an atom cache size 8 times larger than
	    before. The new atom cache protocol is documented in the
	    ERTS users guide.</p>
          <p>
	    Erlang messages received via the distribution are now
	    decoded by the receiving Erlang processes without holding
	    any distribution channel specific locks. Erlang messages
	    and signals sent over the distribution are as before
	    encoded by the sending Erlang process, but now without
	    holding any distribution channel specific locks during
	    the encoding. That is, both encoding and decoding can be
	    and are done in parallel regardless of distribution
	    channel used.</p>
          <p>
	    The part that cannot be parallelized is the atom cache
	    updates. Atom cache updates are therefore now scheduled
	    on the distribution port. Since it is only one entity per
	    distribution channel doing this work there is no lock
	    contention due to the atom cache updates.</p>
          <p>
	    The new runtime system does not understand the old atom
	    cache protocol. New and old runtime systems can however
	    still communicate, but no atom cache will be used.</p>

          <p>Fixed a bug in <c>etop</c> which made the Load and Memory
            information in the header incorrect -- for example the
            value shown for <c>binary</c> (memory allocated for
            binaries) was actually the number of currently running
            processes. (Thanks to Rikard Johansson.)</p>
