    <warning>
      <p>
	The Toolbar application is deprecated and will be removed in R16.
      </p>
    </warning>
  <p>Toolbar provides an interface to the various Erlang tools which are available. Toolbar can also provide access to user supplied tools which are included with the Erlang software release. These tools are called GS Contributions.</p>
  <p>All tools included in Toolbar must have a configuration file which contains information about the tool, such as its start function and the location of help information. The name of a configuration file must include the suffix <c>.tool</c>.
    </p>
  <p>Start the Toolbar application with one of the following commands:
    </p>
  <list type="bulleted">
    <item>enter the command <c>toolbar:start().</c> from the command line after Erlang has been started.</item>
    <item>start Erlang with the command <c>erl -s toolbar</c>.</item>
  </list>
  <p>When started, Toolbar automatically checks for <c>*.tool</c> files in the current path and adds the corresponding tools. For each <c>ebin</c> directory found in the path, it will also look in a <c>priv</c> directory next to it. This is a function of the Erlang file structure.
    </p>
  <p>You can update Toolbar with menu commands on Toolbar window. Refer to the File Menu and Tools Menu sections below for details.
    </p>
