==============================================================================
	Major features, additions and changes between Typer versions
		(in reversed chronological order)
==============================================================================

Version 0.9 (in Erlang/OTP R14B02)
----------------------------------
 - Major rewrite; all code has been cleaned up and placed in one file.
   The only reason why this is not version 1.0 yet is that there is no proper
   documentation for typer which can be displayed in the www.erlang.org site.
 - Added ability to receive the set of exported types and report unknown ones.
 - Better handling of overloaded contracts; especially erroneous ones on which
   typer does not crash anymore.
 - Fixed problem that caused typer to hang when given a file whose module name
   did not correspond to the file name. 
 - Added two undocumented options that may come very handy when trying to
   understand why typer reports some particular set of types for the functions
   in a module. These options are mainly for typer developers at this point,
   but may become documented in some future version.
