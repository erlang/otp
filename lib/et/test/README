Testing and running et tests.

Testing gui api/applications can be hard, but we can at least
test that wxerlang behaves as we expected, i.e. that the api
is consistent and that it don't crash.

The tests are structured as they are because we want you to
be able to run them in three different ways.
 - direct via an erlang shell
 - via common_test application 
 - via erlang/OTP inhouse ts tool.

To run all the tests compile them and on unix 
run ./ett to create an erlang terminal.

Invoke ett:t(). in the erlang shell to run all regression tests.
If you want to specific tests invoke ett:t(Module) 
or ett:t(Module, TestCase).

To run all tests including the ones that require manual intervention run.
ett:t(all, [{user,true}]).

To see every test_case window use
ett:t(all, [{user,step}]).
This requires that you manually close each window to step to the 
next test_case.

If you want to run specific test_cases use:
ett:t({Module,TestCase}, [{user,step}]).
