        <p>A function that is intended to be traced.</p>
        <p>This function is intended to be invoked at strategic places
        in user applications in order to enable simplified
        tracing. The functions are extremely light weight as they do
        nothing besides returning an atom. The functions are designed
        for being traced. The global tracing mechanism in
        <c>et_collector</c> defaults to set its trace pattern to these
        functions.</p>
        <p>The label is intended to provide a brief summary of the
        event. It is preferred to use an atom but a string would also
        do.</p>
        <p>The contents can be any term but in order to simplify
          post processing of the traced events, a plain list
          of {Key, Value} tuples is preferred.</p>
        <p>Some events, such as messages, are directed from some actor to another.
          Other events (termed actions) may be undirected and only have one actor.</p>

        <p>These functions sends a signal to the outer space and the
        caller hopes that someone is listening. In other words, they

        respectively.</p>
