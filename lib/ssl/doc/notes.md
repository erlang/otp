# SSL Release Notes

This document describes the changes made to the SSL application.

## SSL 11.1.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

* Legacy name handling could cause interop problems between TLS-1.3/1.2 client and TLS-1.2 server.

  Own Id: OTP-18917 Aux Id: GH-7978

## SSL 11.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- ssl application will validate id-kp-serverAuth and id-kp-clientAuth extended
  key usage only in end entity certificates. public_key application will
  disallow "anyExtendedKeyUsage" for CA certificates that includes the extended
  key usage extension and marks it critical.

  Own Id: OTP-18739

- Replaced unintentional Erlang Public License 1.1 headers in some files with
  the intended Apache License 2.0 header.

  Own Id: OTP-18815 Aux Id: PR-7780

- Correct handling of TLS-1.3 legacy scheme names, could cause interop failures
  for TLS-1.2 clients.

  Own Id: OTP-18817

- Add missing export for connection_info() API type.

  Own Id: OTP-18886

### Improvements and New Features

- Fixed `server name indication` which was not handled properly.

  Own Id: OTP-18836 Aux Id: GH-7795

- Align documentation and implementation

  Own Id: OTP-18853 Aux Id: PR-7841

- Improve connection setup by optimizing certificate lookup.

  Own Id: OTP-18893 Aux Id: PR-7920 PR-7921

## SSL 11.0.3

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Avoid function clause error in ssl:getopts/2 by handling that inet:getopts may
  return an empty list during some circumstances, such as the socket being in a
  closing state.

  Own Id: OTP-18697 Aux Id: GH-7506

- The API function \`ssl:recv/3\` has been tightened to disallow negative
  length, which has never been documented to work, but was passed through and
  caused strange errors.

  Own Id: OTP-18700 Aux Id: GH-7507

- When a client initiated renegotiation was rejected and the client socket was
  in active mode the expected error message to the controlling process was not
  sent.

  Own Id: OTP-18712 Aux Id: GH-7431

### Improvements and New Features

- Add some guidance for signature algorithms configuration in ssl applications
  users guide.

  Own Id: OTP-18631

## SSL 11.0.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Added keylog information to all protocol versions in
  `ssl:connection_information/2`.

  Own Id: OTP-18643 Aux Id: ERIERL-932

### Improvements and New Features

- Add RFC-6083 considerations for DTLS to enable gen_sctp based callback for the
  transport.

  Own Id: OTP-18618 Aux Id: ERIERL-932

## SSL 11.0.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Make sure that selection of client certificates handle both TLS-1.3 and
  TLS-1.2 names correctly. Could cause valid client certificate to not be
  selected, and an empty client certificate message to be sent to server.

  Own Id: OTP-18588 Aux Id: GH-7264, PR-7277

- Improved `ssl:format_error/1` to handle more error tuples.

  Own Id: OTP-18596 Aux Id: GH-7247

- Fixed hanging `ssl:connect` when ssl application is not started.

  Own Id: OTP-18603 Aux Id: GH-7297

- Correct handling of retransmission timers, current behavior could cause
  unwanted delays.

  Own Id: OTP-18632 Aux Id: PR-7300, GH-7301

## SSL 11.0

### Improvements and New Features

- Remove less that 256 bit ECC from default supported ECC pre TLS-1.3

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-14771

- Improved error checking and handling of ssl options.

  Own Id: OTP-15903

- With this change, stateless tickets generated by server with anti_replay
  option enabled can be used for creating ClientHello throughout ticket
  lifetime. Without this change, usability was limited to WindowSize number of
  seconds configured for anti_replay option.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-18168 Aux Id: PR-6019, GH-6014

- Support for Kernel TLS (kTLS), has been added to the SSL application, for TLS
  distribution (`-proto_dist inet_tls`), the SSL option `{ktls, true}`. Using
  this for general SSL sockets is uncomfortable, undocumented and not
  recommended since it requires very platform dependent raw options.

  This, for now, only works for some not too old Linux distributions. Roughly, a
  kernel 5.2.0 or later with support for UserLand Protocols and the kernel
  module `tls` is required.

  Own Id: OTP-18235 Aux Id: PR-6104, PR-5840

- With this change, TLS 1.3 server can be configured to include client
  certificate in session ticket.

  Own Id: OTP-18253

- With this change, it is possible to configure encryption seed to be used with
  TLS1.3 stateless tickets. This enables using tickets on different server
  instances.

  Own Id: OTP-18254 Aux Id: PR-5982

- Debugging enhancements.

  Own Id: OTP-18312

- With this change, maybe keyword atom is not used as function name in ssl code.

  Own Id: OTP-18335

- Replace size/1 with either tuple_size/1 or byte_size/1

  The [`size/1`](`size/1`) BIF is not optimized by the JIT, and its use can
  result in worse types for Dialyzer.

  When one knows that the value being tested must be a tuple,
  [`tuple_size/1`](`tuple_size/1`) should always be preferred.

  When one knows that the value being tested must be a binary,
  [`byte_size/1`](`byte_size/1`) should be preferred. However,
  [`byte_size/1`](`byte_size/1`) also accepts a bitstring (rounding up size to a
  whole number of bytes), so one must make sure that the call to `byte_size/` is
  preceded by a call to [`is_binary/1`](`is_binary/1`) to ensure that bitstrings
  are rejected. Note that the compiler removes redundant calls to
  [`is_binary/1`](`is_binary/1`), so if one is not sure whether previous code
  had made sure that the argument is a binary, it does not harm to add an
  [`is_binary/1`](`is_binary/1`) test immediately before the call to
  [`byte_size/1`](`byte_size/1`).

  Own Id: OTP-18405 Aux Id:
  GH-6672,PR-6702,PR-6768,PR-6700,PR-6769,PR-6812,PR-6814

- For security reasons remove support for SHA1 and DSA algorithms from default
  values.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-18438 Aux Id: GH-6679

- Mitigate memory usage from large certificate chains by lowering the maximum
  handshake size. This should not effect the common cases, if needed it can be
  configured to a higher value.

  Own Id: OTP-18453

- Change the client default verify option to verify_peer. Note that this makes
  it mandatory to also supply trusted CA certificates or explicitly set verify
  to verify_none. This also applies when using the so called anonymous test
  cipher suites defined in TLS versions pre TLS-1.3.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-18455 Aux Id: GH-5899

- Erlang distribution code in Kernel and SSL has been refactored a bit to
  facilitate debugging and re-usability, which shouldn't have any noticeable
  effects on behaviour or performance.

  Own Id: OTP-18456

- Add encoding and decoding of use_srtp hello extension to facilitate for DTLS
  users to implement SRTP functionality.

  Own Id: OTP-18459

- Refactors the (`ssl` application to use macros for TLS and DTLS versions
  instead of hard-coded tuple numbers. This change improves the maintainability
  of `ssl`

  Own Id: OTP-18465 Aux Id: GH-7065

- If the function ssl:renegotiate/1 is called on connection that is running
  TLS-1.3 return an error instead of hanging or timing out.

  Own Id: OTP-18507

- If a user cancel alert with level warning is received during handshake make it
  be handled the same regardless of TLS version. If it is received in connection
  in TLS-1.3 regard it as an error as it is inappropriate.

  In TLS-1.3 all error alerts are considered FATAL regardless of legacy alert
  type. But make sure legacy type is printed in logs to not confuse users that
  are expecting the same legacy type as sent by peer.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-18531

- Make `fail_if_no_peer_cert` default true if verify_peer is set on the server,
  otherwise the server will accept the connection if verify_peer is set and the
  user have forgot to set the fail_if_no_peer_cert and the client did not send a
  certificate.

  Own Id: OTP-18567

- To make it easier to configure signature algorithms with algorithms that are
  moved from the default add the API function signature_algs/2 that lists
  possible values. Also make sha224 a non default value.

  Own Id: OTP-18572

## SSL 10.9.1.3

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- ssl application will validate id-kp-serverAuth and id-kp-clientAuth extended
  key usage only in end entity certificates. public_key application will
  disallow "anyExtendedKeyUsage" for CA certificates that includes the extended
  key usage extension and marks it critical.

  Own Id: OTP-18739

- Add missing export for connection_info() API type.

  Own Id: OTP-18886

## SSL 10.9.1.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- The API function \`ssl:recv/3\` has been tightened to disallow negative
  length, which has never been documented to work, but was passed through and
  caused strange errors.

  Own Id: OTP-18700 Aux Id: GH-7507

- When a client initiated renegotiation was rejected and the client socket was
  in active mode the expected error message to the controlling process was not
  sent.

  Own Id: OTP-18712 Aux Id: GH-7431

## SSL 10.9.1.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Added keylog information to all protocol versions in
  `ssl:connection_information/2`.

  Own Id: OTP-18643 Aux Id: ERIERL-932

### Improvements and New Features

- Add RFC-6083 considerations for DTLS to enable gen_sctp based callback for the
  transport.

  Own Id: OTP-18618 Aux Id: ERIERL-932

## SSL 10.9.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- With this change, ssl:connection_information/2 returns correct keylog data
  after TLS1.3 key update.

  Own Id: OTP-18489

- Client signature algorithm list input order is now honored again , it was
  accidently reversed by a previous fix.

  Own Id: OTP-18550

## SSL 10.9

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixed that new `dtls` connections from the same client ip port combination
  works. If there is a process waiting for accept the new connection will
  connect to that, otherwise it will try to re-connect to the old server
  connection.

  Own Id: OTP-18371 Aux Id: GH-6160

- When shutting down a node that uses SSL distribution (`-proto_dist inet_tls`),
  a confusing error message about an unexpected process exit was printed. This
  particular message is no longer generated.

  Own Id: OTP-18443 Aux Id: PR-6810

### Improvements and New Features

- fixes the type spec for ssl:format_error/1

  Own Id: OTP-18366 Aux Id: PR-6565, GH-6506

- Replace size/1 with either tuple_size/1 or byte_size/1

  The [`size/1`](`size/1`) BIF is not optimized by the JIT, and its use can
  result in worse types for Dialyzer.

  When one knows that the value being tested must be a tuple,
  [`tuple_size/1`](`tuple_size/1`) should always be preferred.

  [`is_binary/1`](`is_binary/1`), so if one is not sure whether previous code
  had made sure that the argument is a binary, it does not harm to add an
  [`is_binary/1`](`is_binary/1`) test immediately before the call to
  [`byte_size/1`](`byte_size/1`).

## SSL 10.8.7

### Improvements and New Features

- Maximize compatibility by ignoring change_cipher_spec during handshake even if
  middle_box_mode is not negotiated (mandated by client)

  Own Id: OTP-18433 Aux Id: GH-6772

- Move assert of middlebox message after an hello_retry_request to maximize
  interoperability. Does not changes semantics of the protocol only allows
  unexpected message delay from server.

  Own Id: OTP-18467 Aux Id: GH-6807

## SSL 10.8.6

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- With this change, tls_sender process is hibernated after sufficient
  inactivity.

  Own Id: OTP-18314 Aux Id: GH-6373

- Correct handling of legacy schemes so that ECDSA certs using sha1 may be used
  for some TLS-1.3 configurations.

  Own Id: OTP-18332 Aux Id: GH-6435, PR-6435, ERL-6435

- With this change, tls_sender does not cause logger crash upon key update.

  Own Id: OTP-18349

### Improvements and New Features

- Enhance warning message

  Own Id: OTP-18257 Aux Id: GH-6307

- Provide server option to make certificate_authorities extension in the TLS-1.3
  servers certificate request optional. This will allow clients to send
  incomplete chains that may be reconstructable and thereby verifiable by the
  server, but that would not adhere to the certificate_authorities extension.

  Own Id: OTP-18267 Aux Id: PR-6228, GH-6106

- If the `verify_fun` handles four arguments the DER cert will be supplied as
  one of the arguments.

  Own Id: OTP-18302 Aux Id: ERIERL-867

## SSL 10.8.5

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixes handling of symlinks in cacertfile option.

  Own Id: OTP-18266 Aux Id: GH-6328

## SSL 10.8.4

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Reject unexpected application data in all relevant places for all TLS
  versions. Also, handle TLS-1.3 middlebox compatibility with more care. This
  will make malicious connections fail early and further, mitigate possible DoS
  attacks, that would be caught by the handshake timeout.

  Thanks to Aina Toky Rasoamanana and Olivier Levillain from Télécom SudParis
  for alerting us of the issues in our implementation.

  Own Id: OTP-18044

- With this change, value of cacertfile option will be adjusted before loading
  certs from the file. Adjustments include converting relative paths to absolute
  and converting symlinks to actual file path.

  Thanks to Marcus Johansson

  Own Id: OTP-18099 Aux Id: PR-6287

- In TLS-1.3, if chain certs are missing (so server auth domain adherence can
  not be determined) send peer cert and hope the server is able to recreate a
  chain in its auth domain.

  Own Id: OTP-18191 Aux Id: GH-6105

- Make sure periodical refresh of CA certificate files repopulates cache
  properly.

  Own Id: OTP-18195

- Correct internal CRL cache functions to use internal format consistently.

  Own Id: OTP-18203 Aux Id: PR-5996

- Incorrect handling of client middlebox negotiation for TLS-1.3 could result in
  that a TLS-1.3 server would not use middlebox mode although the client was
  expecting it too and failing the negotiation with unexpected message.

  Own Id: OTP-18219 Aux Id: GH-6241, PR-6249

- If the "User" process, the process starting the TLS connection, gets killed in
  the middle of spawning the dynamic connection tree make sure we do not leave
  any processes behind.

  Own Id: OTP-18233 Aux Id: GH-6244, PR-6270

### Improvements and New Features

- A vulnerability has been discovered and corrected. It is registered as
  CVE-2022-37026 "Client Authentication Bypass". Corrections have been released
  on the supported tracks with patches 23.3.4.15, 24.3.4.2, and 25.0.2. The
  vulnerability might also exist in older OTP versions. We recommend that
  impacted users upgrade to one of these versions or later on the respective
  tracks. OTP 25.1 would be an even better choice. Impacted are those who are
  running an ssl/tls/dtls server using the ssl application either directly or
  indirectly via other applications. For example via inets (httpd), cowboy, etc.
  Note that the vulnerability only affects servers that request client
  certification, that is sets the option \{verify, verify_peer\}.

  Own Id: OTP-18241

## SSL 10.8.3

  Own Id: OTP-18145

## SSL 10.8.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- When a TLS-1.3 enabled client tried to talk to a TLS-1.2 server that coalesces
  TLS-1.2 handshake message over one TLS record, the connection could fail due
  to some message being handled in the wrong state, this has been fixed.

  Own Id: OTP-18087 Aux Id: GH-5961

- Correctly handles supported protocol version change from default to something
  else by sni_fun supplied to ssl:handshake/\[2,3] together with a TCP-socket
  (so called upgrade).

  Own Id: OTP-18100 Aux Id: GH-5985

- Also, TLS-1.3 should respond with a protocol version alert if previous
  versions, that are supported but not configured, are attempted.

  Own Id: OTP-18129 Aux Id: GH-5950

## SSL 10.8

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- When a TLS-1.3 enabled client tried to talk to a TLS-1.2 server that coalesces
  TLS-1.2 handshake message over one TLS record, the connection could fail due
  to some message being handled in the wrong state, this has been fixed.

  Own Id: OTP-18087 Aux Id: GH-5961

  appropriate will be selected based on negotiated properties.

  Own Id: OTP-15993 Aux Id: GH-4143

- Add options for users to be able to set spawn_opts for TLS processes (sender
  and receiver) this may be useful for tuning trade-offs between CPU and Memory
  usage.

  Own Id: OTP-17855 Aux Id: PR-5328

- Allow key file passwords to be input as a single binary, that is we change the
  data type to be the more for the purpose logical data type iodata() instead of
  string().

  Own Id: OTP-17890

- Logging enhancement, add location information to the warning log message.

  Own Id: OTP-18000 Aux Id: PR-5790

  Own Id: OTP-18085

## SSL 10.7.3

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Client certification could fail if TLS-1.3 enabled client negotiated TLS-1.2
  connection with the server, this is due to the wrong version being used when
  decoding the certificate request message from the server.

  Own Id: OTP-18028 Aux Id: GH-5835

## SSL 10.7

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Improved error handling.

  Own Id: OTP-17759 Aux Id: GH-5367

  Own Id: OTP-17816 Aux Id: PR-5607

- Add in some cases earlier detection of possible DoS attacks by malicious
  clients sending unexpected TLS messages instead of the client hello. Note that
  such attacks are already mitigated by providing a timeout for the TLS
  handshake.

  Own Id: OTP-17903

## SSL 10.6.1

## SSL 10.6

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Allow re-connect on DTLS sockets

  Can happen when a computer reboots and connects from the same client port
  without the server noticing should be allowed according to RFC.

  Own Id: OTP-17411 Aux Id: ERL-1203, GH-4393

- Fix tls and non-tls distribution to use erl_epmd:address_please to figure out
  if IPv4 or IPv6 addresses should be used when connecting to the remote node.

  Before this fix, a dns lookup of the remote node hostname determined which IP
  version was to be used which meant that the hostname had to resolve to a valid
  ip address.

  Own Id: OTP-17809 Aux Id: PR-5337 GH-5334

  function_clause error.

  Own Id: OTP-17723 Aux Id: GH-5300

## SSL 10.5.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Before that change, TLS downgrade could occasionally fail when data intended
  for downgraded socket were delivered together with CLOSE_NOTIFY alert to ssl
  app.

  Own Id: OTP-17393

- Avoid re-encoding of decoded certificates. This could cause unexpected
  failures as some subtle encoding errors can be tolerated when decoding but
  hence creating another sequence of bytes if the decoded value is re-encoded.

  Own Id: OTP-17657

- Fix possible process leak when the process doing ssl:transport_accept dies
  before initiating the TLS handshake.

  is called.

  Own Id: OTP-17423 Aux Id: GH-4823 PR-4829

- If trying to downgrade a TLS-1.3 connection to a plain TCP connection,
  possible TLS-1.3 session ticket messages will be ignored in the "downgrade"
  state while waiting for the close notify alert.

  Own Id: OTP-17517 Aux Id: GH-5009

- Corrected error handling to correctly generate an insufficient security alert
  when there are no suitable groups that can be negotiated in TLS-1.3 instead of
  crashing resulting in an internal error alert.

  Own Id: OTP-17521

- Properly handle default session data storage.

  When a client tries to reuse an expired session the default server storage
  handling would crash losing other session data. This would cause a error
  report and possible loss of abbreviated handshakes.

  Own Id: OTP-17635 Aux Id: GH-5192

### Improvements and New Features

- Add support for RSA-PSS-PSS signatures and signature_algorithms_cert in
  TLS-1.2. This is a TLS-1.3 RFC requirement to backport this functionality.

## SSL 10.2.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Avoid that upgrade (from TCP to TLS) servers starts multiple session cache
  handlers for the same server. This applies to Erlang distribution over TLS
  servers.

  Own Id: OTP-17139 Aux Id: ERL-1458, OTP-16239

- Legacy cipher suites defined before TLS-1.2 (but still supported) should be
  possible to use in TLS-1.2. They where accidentally excluded for available
  cipher suites for TLS-1.2 in OTP-23.2.2.

  Own Id: OTP-17174 Aux Id: ERIERL-597

  extraneous certs, to improve memory management.

  Own Id: OTP-17098

### Improvements and New Features

- Add support for AES CCM based cipher suites defined in RFC 7251

  Also Correct cipher suite name conversion to OpenSSL names. A few names where
  corrected earlier in OTP-16267 For backwards compatible reasons we support
  usage of openSSL names for cipher suites. Mostly anonymous suites names where
  incorrect, but also some legacy suites.

  Own Id: OTP-17100

## SSL 10.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- SSL's Erlang Distribution Protocol modules inet_tls_dist and inet6_tls_dist

  Own Id: OTP-17019 Aux Id: ERL-1412

### Improvements and New Features

- Handle extraneous certs in certificate chains as well as chains that are
  incomplete but can be reconstructed or unordered chains. The cert and certfile
  options will now accept a list of certificates so that the user may specify
  the chain explicitly.

  Also, the default value of the depth option has been increased to allow longer
  chains by default.

  Own Id: OTP-16277

- This change implements optional NSS-style keylog in

## SSL 10.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- If a passive socket is created, ssl:recv/2,3 is never called and then the peer
  closes the socket the controlling process will no longer receive an active
  close message.

  Own Id: OTP-16697 Aux Id: ERIERL-496

- Data deliver with ssl:recv/2,3 could fail for when using packet mode. This has
  been fixed by correcting the flow control handling of passive sockets when
  packet mode is used.

- This change fixes a potential man-in-the-middle vulnerability when the ssl
  client is configured to automatically handle session tickets
  (\{session_tickets, auto\}).

  Own Id: OTP-16765

- Fix the internal handling of options 'verify' and 'verify_fun'.

  This change fixes a vulnerability when setting the ssl option 'verify' to
  verify_peer in a continued handshake won't take any effect resulting in the
  acceptance of expired peer certificates.

- Correct flow ctrl checks from OTP-16764 to work as intended. Probably will not
  have a noticeable affect but will make connections more well behaved under
  some circumstances.

  Own Id: OTP-16837 Aux Id: ERL-1319, OTP-16764

- Distribution over TLS could exhibit livelock-like behaviour when there is a
  constant stream of distribution messages. Distribution data is now chunked

### Improvements and New Features

- Implement the cookie extension for TLS 1.3.

  Own Id: OTP-15855

- Experimental OCSP client support.

  Own Id: OTP-16448

- TLS 1.0 -TLS-1.2 sessions tables now have a absolute max value instead of
  using a shrinking mechanism when reaching the limit. To avoid out of memory
  problems under heavy load situations. Note that this change infers that
  implementations of ssl_session_cache_api needs to implement the size function
  (introduce in OTP 19) for session reuse to be optimally utilized.

  Own Id: OTP-16802 Aux Id: ERIERL-516

## SSL 10.0

  enabled by default since OTP 19. Now all code to support it has been removed,
  that is SSL-3.0 protocol version can not be used and is considered invalid.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-14790

- Added support for RSA-PSS signature schemes

  Own Id: OTP-15247

- Improve interoperability by implementing the middlebox compatibility mode.

  The middlebox compatibility mode makes the TLS 1.3 handshake look more like a
  TLS 1.2 handshake and increases the chance of successfully establishing TLS
  1.3 connections through legacy middleboxes.

  Own Id: OTP-15589

- Utilize new properties of
  [`erlang:dist_ctrl_get_data()`](`erlang:dist_ctrl_get_data/1`) for performance

## SSL 9.6.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Correct error handling when the partial_chain fun claims a certificate to be
  the trusted cert that is not part of the chain. This bug would hide the
  appropriate alert generating an "INTERNAL_ERROR" alert instead.

  Own Id: OTP-16567 Aux Id: ERIERL-481

## SSL 9.6

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Correct handling of TLS record limit in TLS-1.3. The max value differs from
  previous versions. Also the payload data max record check was broken, that is

  alert.

  Own Id: OTP-16437 Aux Id: ERL-1135

- Immediately remove session entries if handshake is abruptly closed at
  transport level.

  Own Id: OTP-16479

### Improvements and New Features

- Implementation of the key and initialization vector update feature, and
  general hardening of TLS 1.3.

  There are cryptographic limits on the amount of plaintext which can be safely
  encrypted under a given set of keys.

  This change enforces those limits by triggering automatic key updates on TLS
  1.3 connections.

  Own Id: OTP-15856

- Add support for TLS 1.3 Session Tickets (stateful and stateless). This allows
  session resumption using keying material from a previous successful handshake.

  crash.

  Own Id: OTP-16413 Aux Id: ERL-1136

- Enhance alert logging, in some places the role indication of the alert origin
  was missing. So the log would say undefined instead of client or server.

  Own Id: OTP-16424

- Two different optimizations did not work together and resulted in the possible
  breakage of connections using stream ciphers (that is RC4). Reworked the
  implementation to avoid this.

  Own Id: OTP-16396 Aux Id: ERL-1118

## SSL 9.5.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Add missing alert handling clause for TLS record handling. Could sometimes
  cause confusing error behaviors of TLS connections.

  Own Id: OTP-16357 Aux Id: ERL-1166

- Fix handling of ssl:recv that happens during a renegotiation. Using the
  passive receive function ssl:recv/\[2,3] during a renegotiation would fail the
  connection with unexpected msg.

  Own Id: OTP-16361

## SSL 9.5

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Corrected CRL handling which could cause CRL verification to fail. This could
  happen when the CRL distribution point explicitly specifies the CRL issuer,
  that is not using the fallback.

  Own Id: OTP-16156 Aux Id: ERL-1030

- Correct handling of unordered chains so that it works as expected

  Own Id: OTP-16293

- Add detailed info in ALERT description when client does not send a requested
  cert.

  Own Id: OTP-16266

## SSL 9.4

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Handling of zero size fragments in TLS could cause an infinite loop. This has
  now been corrected.

  Own Id: OTP-15328 Aux Id: ERIERL-379

- DTLS record check needs to consider that a resent hello message can have a
  different version than the negotiated.

### Improvements and New Features

- TLS will now try to order certificate chains if they appear to be unordered.
  That is prior to TLS 1.3, “certificate_list” ordering was required to be
  strict, however some implementations already allowed for some flexibility. For
  maximum compatibility, all implementations SHOULD be prepared to handle
  potentially extraneous certificates and arbitrary orderings from any TLS
  version.

  Own Id: OTP-12983

- TLS will now try to reconstructed an incomplete certificate chains from its
  local CA-database and use that data for the certificate path validation. This
  especially makes sense for partial chains as then the peer might not send an
  intermediate CA as it is considered the trusted root in that case.

## SSL 8.2.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- TLS sessions must be registered with SNI if provided, so that sessions where
  client hostname verification would fail cannot connect reusing a session
  created when the server name verification succeeded.

  Own Id: OTP-14632

- An erlang TLS server configured with cipher suites using rsa key exchange, may
  be vulnerable to an Adaptive Chosen Ciphertext attack (AKA Bleichenbacher
  attack) against RSA, which when exploited, may result in plaintext recovery of
  encrypted messages and/or a Man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack, despite the
  attacker not having gained access to the server’s private key itself.
  [CVE-2017-1000385](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000385)

  Exploiting this vulnerability to perform plaintext recovery of encrypted
  messages will, in most practical cases, allow an attacker to read the
  plaintext only after the session has completed. Only TLS sessions established
  using RSA key exchange are vulnerable to this attack.

  Exploiting this vulnerability to conduct a MiTM attack requires the attacker
  to complete the initial attack, which may require thousands of server
  requests, during the handshake phase of the targeted session within the window
  of the configured handshake timeout. This attack may be conducted against any
  TLS session using RSA signatures, but only if cipher suites using RSA key
  exchange are also enabled on the server. The limited window of opportunity,
  limitations in bandwidth, and latency make this attack significantly more
  difficult to execute.

  RSA key exchange is enabled by default although least prioritized if server
  order is honored. For such a cipher suite to be chosen it must also be
  supported by the client and probably the only shared cipher suite.

  Captured TLS sessions encrypted with ephemeral cipher suites (DHE or ECDHE)
  are not at risk for subsequent decryption due to this vulnerability.

  As a workaround if default cipher suite configuration was used you can
  configure the server to not use vulnerable suites with the ciphers option like
  this:

  `{ciphers, [Suite || Suite <- ssl:cipher_suites(), element(1,Suite) =/= rsa]}`

  that is your code will look somethingh like this:

  `ssl:listen(Port, [{ciphers, [Suite || Suite <- ssl:cipher_suites(), element(1,S) =/= rsa]} | Options]).`

  Thanks to Hanno Böck, Juraj Somorovsky and Craig Young for reporting this
  vulnerability.

  Own Id: OTP-14443

### Improvements and New Features

- TLS-1.2 clients will now always send hello messages on its own format, as
  opposed to earlier versions that will send the hello on the lowest supported
  version, this is a change supported by the latest RFC.

  This will make interoperability with some newer servers smoother. Potentially,
  but unlikely, this could cause a problem with older servers if they do not
  adhere to the RFC and ignore unknown extensions.

## SSL 8.1.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Corrected termination behavior, that caused a PEM cache bug and sometimes
  resulted in connection failures.

  Own Id: OTP-14100

- Fix bug that could hang ssl connection processes when failing to require more
  data for very large handshake packages. Add option max_handshake_size to
  mitigate DoS attacks.

  Own Id: OTP-14138

- Improved support for CRL handling that could fail to work as intended when an
  id-ce-extKeyUsage was present in the certificate. Also improvements where
  needed to distributionpoint handling so that all revocations actually are
  found and not deemed to be not determinable.

  Own Id: OTP-14141

- A TLS handshake might accidentally match old sslv2 format and ssl application
  would incorrectly aborted TLS handshake with ssl_v2_client_hello_no_supported.
  Parsing was altered to avoid this problem.

  Own Id: OTP-14222

- Correct default cipher list to prefer AES 128 before 3DES

  Own Id: OTP-14235

  as a workaround for the current implementation of the PEM-cache that has
  proven to be a bottleneck.

  Own Id: OTP-13883

## SSL 8.0.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- The TLS/SSL protocol version selection for the SSL server has been corrected
  to follow RFC 5246 Appendix E.1 especially in case where the list of supported
  versions has gaps. Now the server selects the highest protocol version it
  supports that is not higher than what the client supports.

  Own Id: OTP-13753 Aux Id: seq13150

## SSL 8.0

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Server now rejects, a not requested client cert, as an incorrect handshake

  over TLS

  Own Id: OTP-13431

- Remove default support for use of md5 in TLS 1.2 signature algorithms

  Own Id: OTP-13463

- ssl now uses gen_statem instead of gen_fsm to implement the ssl connection
  process, this solves some timing issues in addition to making the code more
  intuitive as the behaviour can be used cleanly instead of having a lot of
  workaround for shortcomings of the behaviour.

  Own Id: OTP-13464

- Phase out interoperability with clients that offer SSLv2. By default they are
  no longer supported, but an option to provide interoperability is offered.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-13465

- OpenSSL has functions to generate short (eight hex digits) hashes of issuers
  of certificates and CRLs. These hashes are used by the "c_rehash" script to
  populate directories of CA certificates and CRLs, e.g. in the Apache web
  server. Add functionality to let an Erlang program find the right CRL for a
  given certificate in such a directory.

  Own Id: OTP-13530

- Some legacy TLS 1.0 software does not tolerate the 1/n-1 content split BEAST
  mitigation technique. Add a beast_mitigation SSL option (defaulting to
  one_n_minus_one) to select or disable the BEAST mitigation technique.

  Own Id: OTP-13629

- Introduce a flight concept for handshake packages. This is a preparation for
  enabling DTLS, however it can also have a positive effects for TLS on slow and
  unreliable networks.

  Own Id: OTP-13678

## SSL 7.3.3.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- An erlang TLS server configured with cipher suites using rsa key exchange, may
  be vulnerable to an Adaptive Chosen Ciphertext attack (AKA Bleichenbacher
  attack) against RSA, which when exploited, may result in plaintext recovery of
  encrypted messages and/or a Man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack, despite the
  attacker not having gained access to the server’s private key itself.
  [CVE-2017-1000385](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000385)

  Exploiting this vulnerability to perform plaintext recovery of encrypted
  messages will, in most practical cases, allow an attacker to read the
  plaintext only after the session has completed. Only TLS sessions established
  using RSA key exchange are vulnerable to this attack.

  Exploiting this vulnerability to conduct a MiTM attack requires the attacker
  to complete the initial attack, which may require thousands of server
  requests, during the handshake phase of the targeted session within the window
  of the configured handshake timeout. This attack may be conducted against any
  TLS session using RSA signatures, but only if cipher suites using RSA key
  exchange are also enabled on the server. The limited window of opportunity,
  limitations in bandwidth, and latency make this attack significantly more
  difficult to execute.

  RSA key exchange is enabled by default although least prioritized if server
  order is honored. For such a cipher suite to be chosen it must also be
  supported by the client and probably the only shared cipher suite.

  Captured TLS sessions encrypted with ephemeral cipher suites (DHE or ECDHE)
  are not at risk for subsequent decryption due to this vulnerability.

  As a workaround if default cipher suite configuration was used you can
  configure the server to not use vulnerable suites with the ciphers option like
  this:

  `{ciphers, [Suite || Suite <- ssl:cipher_suites(), element(1,Suite) =/= rsa]}`

  that is your code will look somethingh like this:

  `ssl:listen(Port, [{ciphers, [Suite || Suite <- ssl:cipher_suites(), element(1,S) =/= rsa]} | Options]).`

  Thanks to Hanno Böck, Juraj Somorovsky and Craig Young for reporting this
  vulnerability.

- Improve portability of ECC tests in Crypto and SSL for "exotic" OpenSSL
  versions.

  Own Id: OTP-13311

- Certificate extensions marked as critical are ignored when using verify_none

  Own Id: OTP-13377

- If a certificate doesn't contain a CRL Distribution Points extension, and the

  Own Id: OTP-13285

- Use loopback as server option in TLS-distribution module

  Own Id: OTP-13300

- Verify certificate signature against original certificate binary.

  This avoids bugs due to encoding errors when re-encoding a decode certificate.

- Hibernation with small or a zero timeout will now work as expected

  Own Id: OTP-13189

### Improvements and New Features

- Add upper limit for session cache, configurable on ssl application level.

  If upper limit is reached, invalidate the current cache entries, e.i the
  session lifetime is the max time a session will be kept, but it may be
  invalidated earlier if the max limit for the table is reached. This will keep
  the ssl manager process well behaved, not exhusting memory. Invalidating the
  entries will incrementally empty the cache to make room for fresh sessions
  entries.

- Correct return value of default session callback module

  This error had the symptom that the client check for unique session would
  always fail, potentially making the client session table grow a lot and
  causing long setup times.

  Own Id: OTP-12980

### Improvements and New Features

- Add possibility to downgrade an SSL/TLS connection to a tcp connection, and
  give back the socket control to a user process.

  This also adds the possibility to specify a timeout to the ssl:close function.

  Own Id: OTP-11397

- Add application setting to be able to change fatal alert shutdown timeout,
  also shorten the default timeout. The fatal alert timeout is the number of
  milliseconds between sending of a fatal alert and closing the connection.
  Waiting a little while improves the peers chances to properly receiving the
  alert so it may shutdown gracefully.

- Remove default support for SSL-3.0, due to Poodle vunrability in protocol
  specification.

  Add padding check for TLS-1.0 to remove Poodle vunrability from TLS 1.0, also
  add the option padding_check. This option only affects TLS-1.0 connections and
  if set to false it disables the block cipher padding check to be able to
  interoperate with legacy software.

  Remove default support for RC4 cipher suites, as they are consider too weak.

  This will avoid some unnecessary certificate processing.

  Own Id: OTP-12449

### Improvements and New Features

- Separate client and server session cache internally.

  Avoid session table growth when client starts many connections in such a
  manner that many connections are started before session reuse is possible.
  Only save a new session in client if there is no equivalent session already
  stored.

  Own Id: OTP-11365

- The PEM cache is now validated by a background process, instead of always
  keeping it if it is small enough and clearing it otherwise. That strategy
  required that small caches where cleared by API function if a file changes on
  disk.

  However export the API function to clear the cache as it may still be useful.

  Own Id: OTP-12391

- Add padding check for TLS-1.0 to remove Poodle vulnerability from TLS 1.0,
  also add the option padding_check. This option only affects TLS-1.0
  connections and if set to false it disables the block cipher padding check to
  be able to interoperate with legacy software.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-12420

- Add support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV used to prevent undesired TLS version
  downgrades. If used by a client that is vulnerable to the POODLE attack, and

  the handling of the setopts messages, this is now handled correctly.

  Own Id: OTP-11228

- Now handles signature_algorithm field in digitally_signed properly with proper
  defaults. Prior to this change some elliptic curve cipher suites could fail
  reporting the error "bad certificate".

  Own Id: OTP-11229

- The code emulating the inet header option was changed in the belief that it
  made it inet compatible. However the testing is a bit hairy as the inet option
  is actually broken, now the tests are corrected and the header option should
  work in the same broken way as inet again, preferably use the bitsyntax
  instead.

  Own Id: OTP-11230

### Improvements and New Features

- Integrate elliptic curve contribution from Andreas Schultz

  In order to be able to support elliptic curve cipher suites in SSL/TLS,
  additions to handle elliptic curve infrastructure has been added to public_key
  and crypto.

  This also has resulted in a rewrite of the crypto API to gain consistency and
  remove unnecessary overhead. All OTP applications using crypto has been
  updated to use the new API.

  Impact: Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) offers equivalent security with
  smaller key sizes than other public key algorithms. Smaller key sizes result
  in savings for power, memory, bandwidth, and computational cost that make ECC
  especially attractive for constrained environments.

## SSL 5.2.1

### Improvements and New Features

- Transport callback handling is changed so that gen_tcp is treated as a special
  case where inet will be called directly for functions such as setopts, as
  gen_tcp does not have its own setopts. This will enable users to use the
  transport callback for other customizations such as websockets.

  Own Id: OTP-10847

- Follow up to OTP-10451 solved in ssl-5.2 R16A. Make sure format_error return
  good strings. Replace confusing legacy atoms with more descriptive atoms.

  Own Id: OTP-10864

## SSL 5.1.2.1

### Improvements and New Features

- Make log_alert configurable as option in ssl, SSLLogLevel added as option to
  inets conf file

  Own Id: OTP-11259

## SSL 5.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- SSL: TLS 1.2, advertise sha224 support, thanks to Andreas Schultz.

  Own Id: OTP-10586

- If an ssl server is restarted with new options and a client tries to reuse a
  session the server must make sure that it complies to the new options before
  agreeing to reuse it.

  Own Id: OTP-10595

- Now handles cleaning of CA-certificate database correctly so that there will
  be no memory leek, bug was introduced in ssl- 5.1 when changing implementation
  to increase parallel execution.

  Impact: Improved memory usage, especially if you have many different
  certificates and upgrade tcp-connections to TLS-connections.

  Own Id: OTP-10710

### Improvements and New Features

- Support Next Protocol Negotiation in TLS, thanks to Ben Murphy for the
  contribution.

  Impact: Could give performance benefit if used as it saves a round trip.

  Own Id: OTP-10361 Aux Id: kunagi-214 \[125]

- TLS 1.2 will now be the default TLS version if sufficient crypto support is
  available otherwise TLS 1.1 will be default.

  Impact: A default TLS connection will have higher security and hence it may be
  perceived as slower then before.

  Own Id: OTP-10425 Aux Id: kunagi-275 \[186]

- It is now possible to call controlling_process on a listen socket, same as in
  gen_tcp.

  Own Id: OTP-10447

- Remove filter mechanisms that made error messages backwards compatible with
  old ssl but hid information about what actually happened.

  This does not break the documented API however other reason terms may be
  returned, so code that matches on the reason part of \{error, Reason\} may
  fail.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-10451 Aux Id: kunagi-270 \[181]

- Added missing dependencies to Makefile

  Own Id: OTP-10594

- Removed deprecated function ssl:pid/0, it has been pointless since R14 but has
  been keep for backwards compatibility.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-10613 Aux Id: kunagi-331 \[242]

- Refactor to simplify addition of key exchange methods, thanks to Andreas
  Schultz.

## SSL 5.1.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- ssl:ssl_accept/2 timeout is no longer ignored

  Own Id: OTP-10600

## SSL 5.1.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- ssl:recv/3 could "loose" data when the timeout occurs. If the timeout in
  ssl:connect or ssl:ssl_accept expired the ssl connection process was not
  terminated as it should, this due to gen_fsm:send_all_state_event timeout is a
  client side time out. These timouts are now handled by the gen_fsm-procss
  instead.

  Own Id: OTP-10569

### Improvements and New Features

- Better termination handling that avoids hanging.

  Own Id: OTP-10574

## SSL 5.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Sometimes the client process could receive an extra \{error, closed\} message
  after ssl:recv had returned \{error, closed\}.

  Own Id: OTP-10118

- ssl v3 alert number 41 (no_certificate_RESERVED) is now recognized

  Own Id: OTP-10196

### Improvements and New Features

- Experimental support for TLS 1.1 is now available, will be officially
  supported from OTP-R16. Thanks to Andreas Schultz for implementing the first
  version.

  Own Id: OTP-8871

- Experimental support for TLS 1.2 is now available, will be officially
  supported from OTP-R16. Thanks to Andreas Schultz for implementing the first
  version.

  Own Id: OTP-8872

- Removed some bottlenecks increasing the applications parallelism especially
  for the client side.

  Own Id: OTP-10113

- Workaround for handling certificates that wrongly encode X509countryname in
  utf-8 when the actual value is a valid ASCCI value of length 2. Such
  certificates are accepted by many browsers such as Chrome and Fierfox so for
  interoperability reasons we will too.

  Own Id: OTP-10222

## SSL 5.0.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Robustness and improvement to distribution over SSL

  Fix a bug where ssl_tls_dist_proxy would crash at caller timeout. Fix a bug
  where a timeout from the SSL layer would block the distribution indefinitely.
  Run the proxy exclusively on the loopback interface. (Thanks to Paul Guyot)

  Own Id: OTP-9915

- Fix setup loop of SSL TLS dist proxy

  Fix potential leak of processes waiting indefinitely for data from closed
  sockets during socket setup phase. (Thanks to Paul Guyot)

  Own Id: OTP-9916

- Correct spelling of registered (Thanks to Richard Carlsson)

  Own Id: OTP-9925

- Added TLS PRF function to the SSL API for generation of additional key
  material from a TLS session. (Thanks to Andreas Schultz)

  Own Id: OTP-10024

## SSL 5.0

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Invalidation handling of sessions could cause the time_stamp field in the
  session record to be set to undefined crashing the session clean up process.
  This did not affect the connections but would result in that the session table
  would grow.

  Own Id: OTP-9696 Aux Id: seq11947

- Changed code to use ets:foldl and throw instead of ets:next traversal,
  avoiding the need to explicitly call ets:safe_fixtable. It was possible to get
  a badarg-crash under special circumstances.

  Own Id: OTP-9703 Aux Id: seq11947

- Send ssl_closed notification to active ssl user when a tcp error occurs.

  Own Id: OTP-9734 Aux Id: seq11946

- If a passive receive was ongoing during a renegotiation the process evaluating
  ssl:recv could be left hanging for ever.

  Own Id: OTP-9744

### Improvements and New Features

- Support for the old ssl implementation is dropped and the code is removed.

  Own Id: OTP-7048

- The erlang distribution can now be run over the new ssl implementation. All
  options can currently not be set but it is enough to replace to old ssl
  implementation.

  Own Id: OTP-7053

- public_key, ssl and crypto now supports PKCS-8

  Own Id: OTP-9312

- Implements a CBC timing attack counter measure. Thanks to Andreas Schultz for
  providing the patch.

  Own Id: OTP-9683

- Mitigates an SSL/TLS Computational DoS attack by disallowing the client to
  renegotiate many times in a row in a short time interval, thanks to Tuncer
  Ayaz for alerting us about this.

  Own Id: OTP-9739

- Implements the 1/n-1 splitting countermeasure to the Rizzo Duong BEAST attack,
  affects SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0. Thanks to Tuncer Ayaz for alerting us about this.

  Own Id: OTP-9750

## SSL 4.1.6

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- replace "a ssl" with "an ssl" reindent pkix_path_validation/3 Trivial
  documentation fixes (Thanks to Christian von Roques )

  Own Id: OTP-9464

### Improvements and New Features

- Adds function clause to avoid denial of service attack. Thanks to Vinod for
  reporting this vulnerability.

  Own Id: OTP-9364

- Error handling code now takes care of inet:getopts/2 and inets:setopts/2
  crashes. Thanks to Richard Jones for reporting this.

  Own Id: OTP-9382

- Support explicit use of packet option httph and httph_bin

  Own Id: OTP-9461

- Decoding of hello extensions could fail to come to the correct conclusion due
  to an error in a binary match pattern. Thanks to Ben Murphy.

  Own Id: OTP-9589

## SSL 4.1.5

### Improvements and New Features

- Calling gen_tcp:connect with option \{ip, \{127,0,0,1\}\} results in an exit
  with reason badarg. Neither SSL nor INETS This was not caught, resulting in
  crashes with incomprehensible reasons.

  Own Id: OTP-9289 Aux Id: seq11845

## SSL 4.1.3

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixed error in cache-handling fix from ssl-4.1.2

  Own Id: OTP-9018 Aux Id: seq11739

- Verification of a critical extended_key_usage-extension corrected

  Own Id: OTP-9029 Aux Id: seq11541

## SSL 4.1.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- The ssl application caches certificate files, it will now invalidate cache
  entries if the diskfile is changed.

  Own Id: OTP-8965 Aux Id: seq11739

- Now runs the terminate function before returning from the call made by
  ssl:close/1, as before the caller of ssl:close/1 could get problems with the
  reuseaddr option.

  Own Id: OTP-8992

## SSL 4.1.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Correct handling of client certificate verify message When checking the client
  certificate verify message the server used the wrong algorithm identifier to
  determine the signing algorithm, causing a function clause error in the
  public_key application when the key-exchange algorithm and the public key
  algorithm of the client certificate happen to differ.

  Own Id: OTP-8897

### Improvements and New Features

- For testing purposes ssl now also support some anonymous cipher suites when
  explicitly configured to do so.

  Own Id: OTP-8870

- Sends an error alert instead of crashing if a crypto function for the selected
  cipher suite fails.

  Own Id: OTP-8930 Aux Id: seq11720

## SSL 4.1

### Improvements and New Features

- Updated ssl to ignore CA certs that violate the asn1-spec for a certificate,
  and updated public key asn1 spec to handle inherited DSS-params.

  Own Id: OTP-7884

- Changed ssl implementation to retain backwards compatibility for old option
  \{verify, 0\} that shall be equivalent to \{verify, verify_none\}, also
  separate the cases unknown ca and selfsigned peer cert, and restored return
  value of deprecated function public_key:pem_to_der/1.

  Own Id: OTP-8858

- Changed the verify fun so that it differentiate between the peer certificate
  and CA certificates by using valid_peer or valid as the second argument to the
  verify fun. It may not always be trivial or even possible to know when the
  peer certificate is reached otherwise.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-8873

## SSL 4.0.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- The server now verifies the client certificate verify message correctly,
  instead of causing a case-clause.

  Own Id: OTP-8721

- The client hello message now always include ALL available cipher suites (or
  those specified by the ciphers option). Previous implementation would filter
  them based on the client certificate key usage extension (such filtering only
  makes sense for the server certificate).

  Own Id: OTP-8772

- Fixed handling of the option \{mode, list\} that was broken for some packet
  types for instance line.

  Own Id: OTP-8785

- Empty packets were not delivered to the client.

  Own Id: OTP-8790

- Building in a source tree without prebuilt platform independent build results
  failed on the SSL examples when:

  - cross building. This has been solved by not building the SSL examples during
    a cross build.
  - building on Windows.

  Own Id: OTP-8791

- Fixed a handshake error which occurred on some ssl implementations.

  Own Id: OTP-8793

### Improvements and New Features

- Revise the public_key API - Cleaned up and documented the public_key API to
  make it useful for general use, also changed ssl to use the new API.

  Own Id: OTP-8722

- Added support for inputing certificates and keys directly in DER format these
  options will override the pem-file options if specified.

  Own Id: OTP-8723

- To gain interoperability ssl will not check for padding errors when using TLS
  1.0. It is first in TLS 1.1 that checking the padding is an requirement.

  Own Id: OTP-8740

- Changed the semantics of the verify_fun option in the ssl-application so that
  it takes care of both application handling of path validation errors and
  verification of application specific extensions. This means that it is now
  possible for the server application in verify_peer mode to handle path
  validation errors. This change moved some functionality earlier in ssl to the
  public_key application.

  Own Id: OTP-8770

- Added the functionality so that the verification fun will be called when a
  certificate is considered valid by the path validation to allow access to each
  certificate in the path to the user application. Also try to verify
  subject-AltName, if unable to verify it let the application verify it.

  Own Id: OTP-8825

## SSL 4.0

### Improvements and New Features

- New ssl now support client/server-certificates signed by dsa keys.

  Own Id: OTP-8587

- Ssl has now switched default implementation and removed deprecated certificate
  handling. All certificate handling is done by the public_key application.

  Own Id: OTP-8695
