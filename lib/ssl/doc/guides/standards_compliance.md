# Standards Compliance

## Purpose

This section describes the current state of standards compliance of the ssl
application.

## Common (pre TLS 1.3)

- For security reasons RSA key exchange cipher suites are no longer supported by
  default, but can be configured. (OTP 21)
- For security reasons DES cipher suites are no longer supported by default, but
  can be configured. (OTP 20)
- For security reasons 3DES cipher suites are no longer supported by default,
  but can be configured. (OTP 21)
- Renegotiation Indication Extension
  [RFC 5746](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5746.txt) is supported
- Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman cipher suites are supported, but not Diffie Hellman
  Certificates cipher suites.
- Elliptic Curve cipher suites are supported if the Crypto application supports
  it and named curves are used.
- Export cipher suites are not supported as the U.S. lifted its export
  restrictions in early 2000.
- IDEA cipher suites are not supported as they have become deprecated by the TLS
  1.2 specification so it is not motivated to implement them.
- Compression is not supported.
- It is possible to use Pre-Shared Key (PSK) and Secure Remote Password (SRP)
  cipher suites, but they are not enabled by default and need addition configuration.
 
## Common

- CRL validation is supported.
- Policy certificate extensions are supported. (OTP 27)
- 'Server Name Indication' extension
  ([RFC 6066](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6066.txt)) is supported.
- Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) and its successor Next Protocol
  Negotiation (NPN) are supported.

## SSL 2.0

For security reasons SSL-2.0 is not supported. Interoperability with SSL-2.0
enabled clients dropped. (OTP 21)

## SSL 3.0

For security reasons SSL-3.0 is no longer supported at all. (OTP 23)

For security reasons SSL-3.0 is no longer supported by default, but can be
configured. (OTP 19)

## TLS 1.0

For security reasons TLS-1.0 is no longer supported by default, but can be
configured. (OTP 22)

## TLS 1.1

For security reasons TLS-1.1 is no longer supported by default, but can be
configured. (OTP 22)

## TLS 1.2

Supported

## DTLS 1.0

For security reasons DTLS-1.0 (based on TLS 1.1) is no longer supported by
default, but can be configured. (OTP 22)

## DTLS 1.2

Supported (based on TLS 1.2)

## DTLS 1.3

Not yet supported

## TLS 1.3

OTP-22 introduces support for TLS 1.3. The current implementation supports a
selective set of cryptographic algorithms:

- Key Exchange: ECDHE groups supported by default
- Groups: all standard groups supported for the Diffie-Hellman key exchange
- Groups: Support brainpool groups from RFC 8734
- Ciphers: all mandatory cipher suites are supported
- Signature Algorithms: All algorithms form RFC 8446
- Certificates: RSA, ECDSA and EDDSA keys

Other notable features:

- PSK and session resumption is supported (stateful and stateless tickets)
- Anti-replay protection using Bloom-filters with stateless tickets
- Early data and 0-RTT is supported
- Key and Initialization Vector Update is supported

For more detailed information see the
[Standards Compliance](standards_compliance.md#soc_table) below.

The following table describes the current state of standards compliance for TLS
1.3.

(_C_ = Compliant, _NC_ = Non-Compliant, _PC_ = Partially-Compliant, _NA_ = Not
Applicable)
