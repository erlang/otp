  <p>Here we consider the creation of example certificates. 
    </p>

  <section>
    <title>The openssl Command</title>
    <p>The <c>openssl</c> command is a utility that comes with the
      OpenSSL distribution. It provides a variety of subcommands. Each
      subcommand is invoked as</p>
    <code type="none"><![CDATA[
      openssl subcmd <options and arguments>    ]]></code>
    <p>where <c>subcmd</c> denotes the subcommand in question.
      </p>
    <p>We shall use the following subcommands to create certificates for
      the purpose of testing Erlang/OTP SSL:
      </p>
    <list type="bulleted">
      <item><em>req</em> to create certificate requests and a
       self-signed certificates, 
      </item>
      <item><em>ca</em> to create certificates from certificate requests.</item>
    </list>
    <p>We create the following certificates:
      </p>
    <list type="bulleted">
      <item>the <em>erlangCA</em> root certificate (a self-signed
       certificate), </item>
      <item>the <em>otpCA</em> certificate signed by the <em>erlangCA</em>, </item>
      <item>a client certificate signed by the <em>otpCA</em>, and</item>
      <item>a server certificate signed by the <em>otpCA</em>.</item>
    </list>

    <section>
      <title>The openssl configuration file</title>
      <p>An <c>openssl</c> configuration file consist of a number of
        sections, where each section starts with one line containing
        <c>[ section_name ]</c>, where <c>section_name</c> is the name
        of the section. The first section of the file is either
        unnamed, or is named <c>[ default ]</c>. For further details
        see the OpenSSL config(5) manual page.
        </p>
      <p>The required sections for the subcommands we are going to 
        use are as follows:
        </p>
      <table>
        <row>
          <cell align="left" valign="middle">subcommand</cell>
          <cell align="left" valign="middle">required/default section</cell>
          <cell align="left" valign="middle">override command line option</cell>
          <cell align="left" valign="middle">configuration file option</cell>
        </row>
        <row>
          <cell align="left" valign="middle">req</cell>
          <cell align="left" valign="middle">[req]</cell>
          <cell align="left" valign="middle">-</cell>
          <cell align="left" valign="middle"><c>-config FILE</c></cell>
        </row>
        <row>
          <cell align="left" valign="middle">ca</cell>
          <cell align="left" valign="middle">[ca]</cell>
          <cell align="left" valign="middle"><c>-name section</c></cell>
          <cell align="left" valign="middle"><c>-config FILE</c></cell>
        </row>
        <tcaption>openssl subcommands to use</tcaption>
      </table>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Creating the Erlang root CA</title>
      <p>The Erlang root CA is created with the command</p>
      <code type="none">
\011openssl req -new -x509 -config /some/path/req.cnf \\
\011    -keyout /some/path/key.pem -out /some/path/cert.pem      </code>
      <p>where the option <c>-new</c> indicates that we want to create
        a new certificate request and the option <c>-x509</c> implies
        that a self-signed certificate is created.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Creating the OTP CA</title>
      <p>The OTP CA is created by first creating a certificate request
        with the command</p>
      <code type="none">
\011openssl req -new -config /some/path/req.cnf \\
\011    -keyout /some/path/key.pem -out /some/path/req.pem      </code>
      <p>and the ask the Erlang CA to sign it:</p>
      <code type="none">
\011openssl ca -batch -notext -config /some/path/req.cnf \\
\011   -extensions ca_cert -in /some/path/req.pem -out /some/path/cert.pem      </code>
      <p>where the option <c>-extensions</c> refers to a section in the
        configuration file saying that it should create a CA certificate, 
        and not a plain user certificate. 
        </p>
      <p>The <c>client</c> and <c>server</c> certificates are created
        similarly, except that the option <c>-extensions</c> then has the 
        value <c>user_cert</c>.  
        </p>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>An Example</title>
    <p>The following module <c>create_certs</c> is used by the Erlang/OTP
      SSL application for generating certificates to be used in tests. The
      source code is also found in <c>ssl-X.Y.Z/examples/certs/src</c>.
      </p>
    <p>The purpose of the <c>create_certs:all/1</c> function is to make
      it possible to provide from the <c>erl</c> command line, the
      full path name of the <c>openssl</c> command.
      </p>
    <p>Note that the module creates temporary OpenSSL configuration files
      for the <c>req</c> and <c>ca</c> subcommands. 
      </p>
