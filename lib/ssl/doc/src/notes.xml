	    Add missing validation of the server_name_indication
	    option and test for its explicit use. It was not possible
	    to set or disable the default server_name_indication as
	    the validation of the option was missing.</p>

	    TLS code has been refactored to prepare for future DTLS

	    Setopts during renegotiation caused the renegotiation to
	    be unsuccessful.</p>
          <p>
	    If calling setopts during a renegotiation the FSM state
	    might change during the handling of the setopts messages,
	    this is now handled correctly.</p>

	    The code emulating the inet header option was changed in
	    the belief that it made it inet compatible. However the
	    testing is a bit hairy as the inet option is actually
	    broken, now the tests are corrected and the header option
	    should work in the same broken way as inet again,
	    preferably use the bitsyntax instead.</p>

	    Integrate elliptic curve contribution from Andreas
	    Schultz </p>
          <p>
	    In order to be able to support elliptic curve cipher
	    suites in SSL/TLS, additions to handle elliptic curve
	    infrastructure has been added to public_key and crypto.</p>
          <p>
	    This also has resulted in a rewrite of the crypto API to
	    gain consistency and remove unnecessary overhead. All OTP
	    applications using crypto has been updated to use the new
	    API.</p>
          <p>
	    Impact: Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) offers
	    equivalent security with smaller key sizes than other
	    public key algorithms. Smaller key sizes result in
	    savings for power, memory, bandwidth, and computational
	    cost that make ECC especially attractive for constrained
	    environments.</p>

	    Transport callback handling is changed so that gen_tcp is
	    treated as a special case where inet will be called
	    directly for functions such as setopts, as gen_tcp does
	    not have its own setopts. This will enable users to use
	    the transport callback for other customizations such as
	    websockets.</p>

	    TLS 1.2 will now be the default TLS version if sufficient

          <p>

	    this due to gen_fsm:send_all_state_event timout is a

	    Changed the semantics of the verify_fun option in the

	    subject-AltName, if unable to verify it let the
	    application verify it.</p>
