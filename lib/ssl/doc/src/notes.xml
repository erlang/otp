    <section><title>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</title>
      <list>
        <item>
	    <p>If present, extended key-usage TLS (SSL) role check
	    (<c>pk-clientAuth</c>, <c>pk-serverAuth</c>) should
	    always be performed for peer-cert. An intermediate CA
	    cert may relax the requirement if
	    <c>AnyExtendedKeyUsage</c> purpose is present.</p>
	    <p>In OTP-25.3.2.8, OTP-26.2 and OTP-27.0 these
	    requirements became too relaxed. There where two
	    problems, firstly the peer cert extension was only
	    checked if it was marked critical, and secondly the CA
	    cert check did not assert the relaxed
	    <c>AnyExtendedKeyUsage</c> purpose.</p>
	    <p>This could result in that certificates might be
	    misused for purposes not intended by the certificate
	    authority.</p>
	    <p>Thanks to Bryan Paxton for reporting the issue.</p>

	    <p>Back port certificate_authorities option for TLS-1.3
	    servers to pre TLS-1.3 servers to enable them to disable
	    the sending of certificate authorities in their
	    certificate request. This will have same affect as the
	    the TLS-1.3 server option although it is handled by a
	    different mechanism in these versions, where the
	    functionality is described to be more of a guidance,
	    although some pre TLS clients have proven to make it
	    mandatory as in TLS-1.3 extension handling.</p>

          <p>
	    Starting from TLS-1.3 some server handshake alerts might
	    arrive after ssl:connection/2,3,4 has returned. If the
	    socket is in active mode the controlling process will get
	    the alert message, but passive sockets would only get
	    {error, closed} on next call to ssl:recv/2,3 or
	    ssl/setopts/2. Passive sockets calls will now return
	    {error, error_alert()} instead.</p>

	    Refactor trying to also make some optimizations
	    introduced a bug in signature algorithms checks in

          <p>
	    Servers configured to support only version (pre TLS-1.2)
	    should ignore hello version extension, as it is an
	    unknown extension to them, this will result in that new
	    clients that do not support the old server version will
	    get an insufficient security alert from the server and
	    not a protocol version alert, this is consistent with how
	    old servers not able to support higher protocol versions
	    work.</p>

	    A race in the kTLS flavour of SSL distribution has been
	    fixed so inet_drv.c doesn't read ahead too much data

	    A vulnerability has been discovered and corrected. It is
	    registered as CVE-2022-37026 "Client Authentication
	    Bypass". Corrections have been released on the supported
	    tracks with patches 23.3.4.15, 24.3.4.2, and 25.0.2. The
	    vulnerability might also exist in older OTP versions. We
	    recommend that impacted users upgrade to one of these
	    versions or later on the respective tracks. OTP 25.1
	    would be an even better choice. Impacted are those who
	    are running an ssl/tls/dtls server using the ssl
	    application either directly or indirectly via other
	    applications. For example via inets (httpd), cowboy, etc.
	    Note that the vulnerability only affects servers that
	    request client certification, that is sets the option
	    {verify, verify_peer}.</p>

	    <p> An erlang TLS server configured with cipher suites
	    using rsa key exchange, may be vulnerable to an Adaptive
	    Chosen Ciphertext attack (AKA Bleichenbacher attack)
	    against RSA, which when exploited, may result in
	    plaintext recovery of encrypted messages and/or a
	    Man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack, despite the attacker not
	    having gained access to the server’s private key
	    itself. <url
	    href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000385">CVE-2017-1000385</url>
	    </p> <p> Exploiting this vulnerability to perform
	    plaintext recovery of encrypted messages will, in most
	    practical cases, allow an attacker to read the plaintext
	    only after the session has completed. Only TLS sessions
	    established using RSA key exchange are vulnerable to this
	    attack. </p> <p> Exploiting this vulnerability to conduct
	    a MiTM attack requires the attacker to complete the
	    initial attack, which may require thousands of server
	    requests, during the handshake phase of the targeted
	    session within the window of the configured handshake
	    timeout. This attack may be conducted against any TLS
	    session using RSA signatures, but only if cipher suites
	    using RSA key exchange are also enabled on the server.
	    The limited window of opportunity, limitations in
	    bandwidth, and latency make this attack significantly
	    more difficult to execute. </p> <p> RSA key exchange is
	    enabled by default although least prioritized if server
	    order is honored. For such a cipher suite to be chosen it
	    must also be supported by the client and probably the
	    only shared cipher suite. </p> <p> Captured TLS sessions
	    encrypted with ephemeral cipher suites (DHE or ECDHE) are
	    not at risk for subsequent decryption due to this
	    vulnerability. </p> <p> As a workaround if default cipher
	    suite configuration was used you can configure the server
	    to not use vulnerable suites with the ciphers option like
	    this: </p> <c> {ciphers, [Suite || Suite &lt;-
	    ssl:cipher_suites(), element(1,Suite) =/= rsa]} </c> <p>
	    that is your code will look somethingh like this: </p>
	    <c> ssl:listen(Port, [{ciphers, [Suite || Suite &lt;-
	    ssl:cipher_suites(), element(1,S) =/= rsa]} | Options]).
	    </c> <p> Thanks to Hanno Böck, Juraj Somorovsky and

	  Man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack, despite the attacker not
	  having gained access to the server’s private key
	  itself. <url
	  href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000385">CVE-2017-1000385</url>
	  </p> <p> Exploiting this vulnerability to perform
	  plaintext recovery of encrypted messages will, in most
	  practical cases, allow an attacker to read the plaintext
	  only after the session has completed. Only TLS sessions
	  established using RSA key exchange are vulnerable to this
	  attack. </p> <p> Exploiting this vulnerability to conduct
	  a MiTM attack requires the attacker to complete the
	  initial attack, which may require thousands of server
	  requests, during the handshake phase of the targeted
	  session within the window of the configured handshake
	  timeout. This attack may be conducted against any TLS
	  session using RSA signatures, but only if cipher suites
	  using RSA key exchange are also enabled on the server.
	  The limited window of opportunity, limitations in
	  bandwidth, and latency make this attack significantly
	  more difficult to execute. </p> <p> RSA key exchange is
	  enabled by default although least prioritized if server
	  order is honored. For such a cipher suite to be chosen it
	  must also be supported by the client and probably the
	  only shared cipher suite. </p> <p> Captured TLS sessions
	  encrypted with ephemeral cipher suites (DHE or ECDHE) are
	  not at risk for subsequent decryption due to this
	  vulnerability. </p> <p> As a workaround if default cipher
	  suite configuration was used you can configure the server
	  to not use vulnerable suites with the ciphers option like
	  this: </p> <c> {ciphers, [Suite || Suite &lt;-
	  ssl:cipher_suites(), element(1,Suite) =/= rsa]} </c> <p>
	  that is your code will look somethingh like this: </p>
	  <c> ssl:listen(Port, [{ciphers, [Suite || Suite &lt;-
	  ssl:cipher_suites(), element(1,S) =/= rsa]} | Options]).
	  </c> <p> Thanks to Hanno Böck, Juraj Somorovsky and
	  Craig Young for reporting this vulnerability. </p>

	    Integrate elliptic curve contribution from Andreas
	    Schultz </p>
          <p>
	    In order to be able to support elliptic curve cipher
	    suites in SSL/TLS, additions to handle elliptic curve
	    infrastructure has been added to public_key and crypto.</p>
          <p>
	    This also has resulted in a rewrite of the crypto API to
	    gain consistency and remove unnecessary overhead. All OTP
	    applications using crypto has been updated to use the new
	    API.</p>
          <p>
	    Impact: Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) offers
	    equivalent security with smaller key sizes than other
	    public key algorithms. Smaller key sizes result in
	    savings for power, memory, bandwidth, and computational
	    cost that make ECC especially attractive for constrained
	    environments.</p>

	    so that there will be no memory leek, bug was introduced
	    in ssl- 5.1 when changing implementation to increase
	    parallel execution.</p>
          <p>
	    Impact: Improved memory usage, especially if you have
	    many different certificates and upgrade tcp-connections
	    to TLS-connections.</p>

	    To gain interoperability ssl will not check for padding
	    errors when using TLS 1.0. It is first in TLS 1.1 that
	    checking the padding is an requirement.</p>

	    Changed the semantics of the verify_fun option in the
	    ssl-application so that it takes care of both application
	    handling of path validation errors and verification of
	    application specific extensions. This means that it is
	    now possible for the server application in verify_peer
	    mode to handle path validation errors. This change moved
	    some functionality earlier in ssl to the public_key
	    application.</p>

	    Added the functionality so that the verification fun will
	    be called when a certificate is considered valid by the
	    path validation to allow access to each certificate in
	    the path to the user application. Also try to verify
	    subject-AltName, if unable to verify it let the
	    application verify it.</p>
