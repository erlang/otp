	    With this change, stateless tickets generated by server
	    with anti_replay option enabled can be used for creating
	    ClientHello throughout ticket lifetime. Without this
	    change, usability was limited to WindowSize number of
	    seconds configured for anti_replay option.</p>

	    <p> Support for Kernel TLS (kTLS), has been added to the
	    SSL application, for TLS distribution (<c>-proto_dist
	    inet_tls</c>), the SSL option <c>{ktls, true}</c>. Using
	    this for general SSL sockets is uncomfortable,
	    undocumented and not recommended since it requires very
	    platform dependent raw options. </p><p> This, for now,
	    only works for some not too old Linux distributions.
	    Roughly, a kernel 5.2.0 or later with support for
	    UserLand Protocols and the kernel module <c>tls</c> is
	    required. </p>

	    Replace size/1 with either tuple_size/1 or byte_size/1</p>
          <p>
	    The <c>size/1</c> BIF is not optimized by the JIT, and
	    its use can result in worse types for Dialyzer.</p>
          <p>
	    When one knows that the value being tested must be a
	    tuple, <c>tuple_size/1</c> should always be preferred.</p>
          <p>
	    When one knows that the value being tested must be a
	    binary, <c>byte_size/1</c> should be preferred. However,
	    <c>byte_size/1</c> also accepts a bitstring (rounding up
	    size to a whole number of bytes), so one must make sure
	    that the call to <c>byte_size/</c> is preceded by a call
	    to <c>is_binary/1</c> to ensure that bitstrings are
	    rejected. Note that the compiler removes redundant calls
	    to <c>is_binary/1</c>, so if one is not sure whether
	    previous code had made sure that the argument is a
	    binary, it does not harm to add an <c>is_binary/1</c>
	    test immediately before the call to <c>byte_size/1</c>.</p>

	    Mitigate memory usage from large certificate chains by
	    lowering the maximum handshake size. This should not

	    Change the client default verify option to verify_peer.
	    Note that this makes it mandatory to also supply trusted
	    CA certificates or explicitly set verify to verify_none.
	    This also applies when using the so called anonymous test
	    cipher suites defined in TLS versions pre TLS-1.3.</p>

	    Erlang distribution code in Kernel and SSL has been

	    If a user cancel alert with level warning is received
	    during handshake make it be handled the same regardless
	    of TLS version. If it is received in connection in
	    TLS-1.3 regard it as an error as it is inappropriate.</p>
          <p>
	    In TLS-1.3 all error alerts are considered FATAL
	    regardless of legacy alert type. But make sure legacy
	    type is printed in logs to not confuse users that are
	    expecting the same legacy type as sent by peer.</p>

	    A vulnerability has been discovered and corrected. It is
	    registered as CVE-2022-37026 "Client Authentication
	    Bypass". Corrections have been released on the supported
	    tracks with patches 23.3.4.15, 24.3.4.2, and 25.0.2. The
	    vulnerability might also exist in older OTP versions. We
	    recommend that impacted users upgrade to one of these
	    versions or later on the respective tracks. OTP 25.1
	    would be an even better choice. Impacted are those who
	    are running an ssl/tls/dtls server using the ssl
	    application either directly or indirectly via other
	    applications. For example via inets (httpd), cowboy, etc.
	    Note that the vulnerability only affects servers that
	    request client certification, that is sets the option
	    {verify, verify_peer}.</p>

	    Fix CVE-2020-35733 this only affects ssl-10.2 (OTP-23.2).
	    This vulnerability could enable a man in the middle
	    attack using a fake chain to a known trusted ROOT. Also
	    limits alternative chain handling, for handling of
	    possibly extraneous certs, to improve memory management.</p>

	    <p> An erlang TLS server configured with cipher suites
	    using rsa key exchange, may be vulnerable to an Adaptive
	    Chosen Ciphertext attack (AKA Bleichenbacher attack)
	    against RSA, which when exploited, may result in
	    plaintext recovery of encrypted messages and/or a
	    Man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack, despite the attacker not
	    having gained access to the server’s private key
	    itself. <url
	    href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000385">CVE-2017-1000385</url>
	    </p> <p> Exploiting this vulnerability to perform
	    plaintext recovery of encrypted messages will, in most
	    practical cases, allow an attacker to read the plaintext
	    only after the session has completed. Only TLS sessions
	    established using RSA key exchange are vulnerable to this
	    attack. </p> <p> Exploiting this vulnerability to conduct
	    a MiTM attack requires the attacker to complete the
	    initial attack, which may require thousands of server
	    requests, during the handshake phase of the targeted
	    session within the window of the configured handshake
	    timeout. This attack may be conducted against any TLS
	    session using RSA signatures, but only if cipher suites
	    using RSA key exchange are also enabled on the server.
	    The limited window of opportunity, limitations in
	    bandwidth, and latency make this attack significantly
	    more difficult to execute. </p> <p> RSA key exchange is
	    enabled by default although least prioritized if server
	    order is honored. For such a cipher suite to be chosen it
	    must also be supported by the client and probably the
	    only shared cipher suite. </p> <p> Captured TLS sessions
	    encrypted with ephemeral cipher suites (DHE or ECDHE) are
	    not at risk for subsequent decryption due to this
	    vulnerability. </p> <p> As a workaround if default cipher
	    suite configuration was used you can configure the server
	    to not use vulnerable suites with the ciphers option like
	    this: </p> <c> {ciphers, [Suite || Suite &lt;-
	    ssl:cipher_suites(), element(1,Suite) =/= rsa]} </c> <p>
	    that is your code will look somethingh like this: </p>
	    <c> ssl:listen(Port, [{ciphers, [Suite || Suite &lt;-
	    ssl:cipher_suites(), element(1,S) =/= rsa]} | Options]).

	    as intended when an id-ce-extKeyUsage was present in the

	  <p> An erlang TLS server configured with cipher suites

	  against RSA, which when exploited, may result in
	  plaintext recovery of encrypted messages and/or a

	  </p> <p> Exploiting this vulnerability to perform
	  plaintext recovery of encrypted messages will, in most
	  practical cases, allow an attacker to read the plaintext
	  only after the session has completed. Only TLS sessions

	  a MiTM attack requires the attacker to complete the

	  requests, during the handshake phase of the targeted
	  session within the window of the configured handshake
	  timeout. This attack may be conducted against any TLS
	  session using RSA signatures, but only if cipher suites

	    Integrate elliptic curve contribution from Andreas
	    Schultz </p>
          <p>
	    In order to be able to support elliptic curve cipher
	    suites in SSL/TLS, additions to handle elliptic curve
	    infrastructure has been added to public_key and crypto.</p>
          <p>
	    This also has resulted in a rewrite of the crypto API to
	    gain consistency and remove unnecessary overhead. All OTP
	    applications using crypto has been updated to use the new
	    API.</p>
          <p>
	    Impact: Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) offers
	    equivalent security with smaller key sizes than other
	    public key algorithms. Smaller key sizes result in
	    savings for power, memory, bandwidth, and computational
	    cost that make ECC especially attractive for constrained
	    environments.</p>

	    X509countryname in utf-8 when the actual value is a valid

	    by many browsers such as Chrome and Fierfox so for
	    interoperability reasons we will too.</p>

	    Robustness and improvement to distribution over SSL</p>
          <p>
	    Fix a bug where ssl_tls_dist_proxy would crash at caller
	    timeout. Fix a bug where a timeout from the SSL layer
	    would block the distribution indefinitely. Run the proxy
	    exclusively on the loopback interface. (Thanks to Paul
