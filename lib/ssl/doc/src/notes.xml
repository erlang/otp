	    Correct handling of client certificate verify message
	    When checking the client certificate verify message the
	    server used the wrong algorithm identifier to determine
	    the signing algorithm, causing a function clause error in
	    the public_key application when the key-exchange
	    algorithm and the public key algorithm of the client
	    certificate happen to differ.</p>

	    Own Id: OTP-7884</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>
	    Changed ssl implementation to retain backwards
	    compatibility for old option {verify, 0} that shall be
	    equivalent to {verify, verify_none}, also separate the
	    cases unknown ca and selfsigned peer cert, and restored
	    return value of deprecated function

	    Changed the verify fun so that it differentiate between
	    the peer certificate and CA certificates by using
	    valid_peer or valid as the second argument to the verify
	    fun. It may not always be trivial or even possible to
	    know when the peer certificate is reached otherwise.</p>

	    The client hello message now always include ALL available
	    cipher suites (or those specified by the ciphers option).
	    Previous implementation would filter them based on the
	    client certificate key usage extension (such filtering
	    only makes sense for the server certificate).</p>

	    To gain interoperability ssl will not check for padding

        <item>
          <p>
	    Changed the semantics of the verify_fun option in the
	    ssl-application so that it takes care of both application
	    handling of path validation errors and verification of
	    application specific extensions. This means that it is
	    now possible for the server application in verify_peer
	    mode to handle path validation errors. This change moved
	    some functionality earlier in ssl to the public_key
	    application.</p>

        <item>
          <p>
	    Added the functionality so that the verification fun will
	    be called when a certificate is considered valid by the
	    path validation to allow access to each certificate in
	    the path to the user application. Also try to verify
	    subject-AltName, if unable to verify it let the
	    application verify it.</p>

            Alert handling has been improved to better handle
            unexpected but valid messages and the implementation is
            also changed to avoid timing related issues that could
            cause different error messages depending on network
            latency. Packet handling was sort of broken but would
            mostly work as expected when socket was in binary mode.
            This has now been fixed.</p>

            New ssl now properly handles ssl renegotiation, and
            initiates a renegotiation if ssl/ltls-sequence numbers
            comes close to the max value. However RFC-5746 is not yet
            supported, but will be in an upcoming release.</p>

            Fixed bug that caused the ssl handshake finished message
            to be calculated wrongly under the circumstances that the
            server did not send the trusted cert and that the
            previous cert did not have the extension telling us the
            trusted certs name. This manifested it self as
            bad_record_mac alert from the server.</p>

            For the ssl client the options cacertfile, certfile and
            keyfile are now optional as they are not always needed
            depending on configuration of the client itself and the
            configuration of the server. Also as PEM-files may
            contain more than one entry the keyfile option will
            default to the same file as given by the certfile option.</p>

            The new ssl implementation released as a alfa in this
            version supports upgrading of a tcp connection to an ssl
            connection so that http client and servers may implement
            RFC 2817.</p>

            <p>A new implementation of ssl is released as a alfa
            version in ssl-3.9 it will later replace the old
            implementation in ssl-4.0. The new implementation can be
            accessed by providing the option {ssl_imp, new} to the
            ssl:connect and ssl:listen functions.</p>
            <p>The new implementation is Erlang based and all logic
            is in Erlang and only payload encryption calculations are
            done in C via the crypto application. The main reason for
            making a new implementation is that the old solution was
            very crippled as the control of the ssl-socket was deep
            down in openssl making it hard if not impossible to
            support all inet options, ipv6 and upgrade of a tcp
            connection to an ssl connection. The alfa version has a
            few limitations that will be removed before the ssl-4.0
            release. Main differences and limitations in the alfa are
            listed below.</p>

            <c>depth</c> has been added.</p>

          <p>Setting of a CA certificate file with the <c>cacertfile</c>
            option (in calls to <c>ssl:accept/1/2</c> or 
            <c>ssl:connect/3/4</c>) does not work due to weaknesses
            in the SSLeay package. </p>
          <p>A work-around is to set the OS environment variable
            <c>SSL_CERT_FILE</c> before SSL is started. However, then
            the CA certificate file will be global for all connections.</p>

          <p>When changing controlling process of an SSL socket, a 
            temporary process is started, which is not gen_server
            compliant.</p>
