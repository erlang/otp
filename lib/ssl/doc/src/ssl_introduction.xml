    <title>Purpose</title>
    <p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor, the Secure
    Sockets Layer (SSL) are cryptographic protocols designed to
    provide communications security over a computer network. They
    use x.509 certificates and hence asymmetric cryptography to
    authenticate the counterparty with whom they are communicating,
    and to exchange a symmetric key. This session key is then used
    to encrypt data flowing between the parties. This allows for
    data/message confidentiality, and message authentication codes
    for message integrity.</p>

    <title>Prerequisites</title>
    <p>It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the Erlang
    programming language, the concepts of OTP, and has a basic
    understanding of SSL/TSP.</p>
