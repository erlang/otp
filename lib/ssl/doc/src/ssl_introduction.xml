    <title>Purpose</title>
    <p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor, the Secure
    Sockets Layer (SSL), are cryptographic protocols designed to
    provide communications security over a computer network. The protocols use
    use X.509 certificates and hence public key (asymmetric) cryptography to
    authenticate the counterpart with whom they communicate,
    and to exchange a symmetric key for payload encryption. The protocol provides
    data/message confidentiality (encryption), integrity (through message authentication code checks)
    and host verification (through certificate path validation).</p>

    <title>Prerequisites</title>
    <p>It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the Erlang
    programming language, the concepts of OTP, and has a basic
    understanding of SSL/TLS.</p>
