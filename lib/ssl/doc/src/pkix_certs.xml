    <title>Introduction to Certificates</title>
    <p>Certificates were originally defined by ITU (CCITT) and the latest 
      definitions are described in <cite id="X.509"></cite>, but those definitions
      are (as always) not working. 
    </p>
    <p>Working certificate definitions for the Internet Community are found
      in the the PKIX RFCs <cite id="rfc3279"></cite> and <cite id="rfc3280"></cite>. 
      The parsing of certificates in the Erlang/OTP SSL application is
      based on those RFCS. 
    </p>
    <p>Certificates are defined in terms of ASN.1 (<cite id="X.680"></cite>).
      For an introduction to ASN.1 see <url href="http://asn1.elibel.tm.fr/">ASN.1 Information Site</url>.

  <section>
    <title>PKIX Certificates</title>
    <p>Certificate handling is now handled by the <c>public_key</c> application.</p>
    <p>
      DER encoded certificates returned by <c>ssl:peercert/1</c> can for example 
      be decoded by the <c>public_key:pkix_decode_cert/2</c> function.
