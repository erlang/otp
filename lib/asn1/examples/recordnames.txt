For each ASN1 types SET and SEQUENCE a record is generated in the .hrl
file with the same name as the corresponding type.
A decoded value is also returned as a record with the appropriate name.
An internally defined type as the type in component 'a' in the
following example will result in a record with name 'Seq_a':

Seq ::= SEQUENCE{
    a	SEQUENCE{
	b INTEGER
	}
}

For each further internally defined type in a SET/SEQUENCE a
'_componentname' is added.

If an internally defined type is an CHOICE alternative the record name
will get the alternative name as a unique part of the name.

Seq ::= SEQUENCE{
    a	CHOICE{
	b SEQUENCE {
	   c  INTEGER
	   }
	}
}

This will produece a record 'Seq_a_b'.

If an component is a SEQUENCE OF a SEQUENCE as in:
Seq ::= SEQUENCE {
    a SEQUENCE OF SEQUENCE {
	       b
	       }
    c SET OF SEQUENCE {
	     d
	     }
}
There will be a record 'Seq_a_SEQOF' and 'Seq_c_SETOF'

A parameterized type should be considered as an internally defined
type. Each time a such type is referenced an instance of it is
defined. Thus in the following example a record 'Seq_b' is generated
in .hrl and used in .erl by decode.

Seq ::= SEQUENCE {
    b PType{INTEGER}
}

PType{T} ::= SEQUENCE{
    id T
}
