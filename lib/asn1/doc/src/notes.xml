	    By default, the ASN.1 compiler is now silent in the
	    absence of warnings or errors. The new '<c>verbose</c>'
	    option or the '<c>-v</c>' option for <c>erlc</c> can be
	    given to show extra information (for instance, about the
	    files that are generated). (Thanks to Tuncer Ayaz.)</p>

	    <p>Cross compilation improvements and other build system
	    improvements.</p>
	    <p>Most notable:</p> <list><item> Lots of cross
	    compilation improvements. The old cross compilation
	    support was more or less non-existing as well as broken.
	    Please, note that the cross compilation support should
	    still be considered as experimental. Also note that old
	    cross compilation configurations cannot be used without
	    modifications. For more information on cross compiling
	    Erlang/OTP see the <c>$ERL_TOP/INSTALL-CROSS.md</c> file.
	    </item><item> Support for staged install using <url
	    href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/DESTDIR.html">DESTDIR</url>.
	    The old broken <c>INSTALL_PREFIX</c> has also been fixed.
	    For more information see the <c>$ERL_TOP/INSTALL.md</c>
	    file. </item><item> Documentation of the <c>release</c>
	    target of the top <c>Makefile</c>. For more information
	    see the <c>$ERL_TOP/INSTALL.md</c> file. </item><item>
	    <c>make install</c> now by default creates relative
	    symbolic links instead of absolute ones. For more
	    information see the <c>$ERL_TOP/INSTALL.md</c> file.
	    </item><item> <c>$ERL_TOP/configure --help=recursive</c>
	    now works and prints help for all applications with
	    <c>configure</c> scripts. </item><item> Doing <c>make
	    install</c>, or <c>make release</c> directly after
	    <c>make all</c> no longer triggers miscellaneous
	    rebuilds. </item><item> Existing bootstrap system is now
	    used when doing <c>make install</c>, or <c>make
	    release</c> without a preceding <c>make all</c>.
	    </item><item> The <c>crypto</c> and <c>ssl</c>
	    applications use the same runtime library path when
	    dynamically linking against <c>libssl.so</c> and
	    <c>libcrypto.so</c>. The runtime library search path has
	    also been extended. </item><item> The <c>configure</c>
	    scripts of <c>erl_interface</c> and <c>odbc</c> now
	    search for thread libraries and thread library quirks the
	    same way as <c>erts</c> do. </item><item> The
	    <c>configure</c> script of the <c>odbc</c> application
	    now also looks for odbc libraries in <c>lib64</c> and
	    <c>lib/64</c> directories when building on a 64-bit
	    system. </item><item> The <c>config.h.in</c> file in the
	    <c>erl_interface</c> application is now automatically
	    generated in instead of statically updated which reduces
	    the risk of <c>configure</c> tests without any effect.
	    </item></list>
	    <p>(Thanks to Henrik Riomar for suggestions and
	    testing)</p>
	    <p>(Thanks to Winston Smith for the AVR32-Linux cross
	    configuration and testing)</p>

	    Add support for prefixing macro names generated by the
	    compiler</p>
          <p>
	    This is useful when multiple protocols that contains
	    macros with identical names are included in a single
	    module.</p>
          <p>

            A new option <c>{n2n,TypeName}</c> can be used to
	    enable generation of conversion functions from name to number 
	    and vice versa for selected ENUMERATION types. 
	    The option can be repeated many times in order to specify several 
	    types in the same file.<br/>
	    If the <c>TypeName</c> specified does not exists or is not an 
	    ENUMERATION type, the compilation will be terminated with an 
	    error code.<br/>
	    Below follows an example on how to use the option from the command line with <c>erlc</c>:<br/>
	    <c>erlc -bper_bin +optimize +driver +"{n2n,'CauseMisc'}" +"{n2n,'CausePcl'}" MyModyle.asn</c>

            A corrupted encoding may cause a loop when a buffer of at
            least two bytes of zero matches tag and length of a SET
            component. This behavior occurred only with decoder
            generated with <c>ber</c> or <c>ber_bin</c> options. Now a
            control breaks the loop.</p>

            The precedence rules for extended constraints have been
            misinterpreted. The rule says for instance that if there
            are more than one constraint on a type that have
            extension-mark, only the last of the extension-marks would
            be kept. This affects the encoding of PER and is now
            corrected.</p>
