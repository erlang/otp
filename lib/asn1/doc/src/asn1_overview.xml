  <title>Introduction</title>

      <p>ASN.1 is a formal language for
      describing data structures to be exchanged between distributed
      computer systems. The purpose of ASN.1 is to have a platform
      and programming language independent notation to express types
      using a standardized set of rules for the transformation of
      values of a defined type into a stream of bytes. This stream of
      bytes can then be sent on any type of communication
      channel. This way, two applications written in different
      programming languages running on different computers, and with
      different internal representation of data, can exchange instances
      of structured data types.</p>
