  <section>
    <title>Test structure</title>

    <p>A test is performed by running one or more test suites. A test suite
    consists of test cases (as well as configuration functions and info 
    functions). Test cases may be grouped in so called test case groups. 
    A test suite is an Erlang module and test cases are implemented as 
    Erlang functions. Test suites are stored in test directories.</p>

  <section>
    <title>Skipping test cases</title>

    <p>It is possible to skip certain test cases, for example if you
    know beforehand that a specific test case fails. This might be
    functionality which isn't yet implemented, a bug that is known but
    not yet fixed or some functionality which doesn't work or isn't
    applicable on a specific platform.</p>

    <p>There are several different ways to state that one or more 
    test cases should be skipped:</p>
    <list>

      <item>Using <c>skip_suites</c> and <c>skip_cases</c>
      terms in 
      <seealso marker="run_test_chapter#test_specifications">test specifications</seealso>.
      </item>

      <item>Returning <c>{skip,Reason}</c> from the
      <c>init_per_testcase/2</c> or <c>init_per_suite/1</c> functions.</item>

      <item>Returning <c>{skip,Reason}</c> from the execution clause
      of the test case.</item>

    </list>

    <p>The latter of course means that the execution clause is
    actually called, so the author must make sure that the test case
    does not run.</p>

    <p>When a test case is skipped, it will be noted as <c>SKIPPED</c>
    in the HTML log.</p>

    <title>Definition of terms</title>
    
    <taglist>

      <tag><em>Auto skipped test case</em></tag>
      <item>
        When a configuration function fails (i.e. terminates unexpectedly), 
	the test cases that depend on the configuration function will be
	skipped automatically by Common Test. The status of the test cases 
	is then "auto skipped".	Test cases are also auto skipped by
	Common Test if required configuration data is not available at
	runtime.
      </item>

      <tag><em>Configuration function</em></tag>
      <item>
        A function in a test suite that is meant to be used for
	setting up, cleaning up, and/or verifying the state and 
	environment on the SUT (System Under Test) and/or the Common Test 
	host node, so that a test case (or a set of test cases) can 
	execute correctly.     
      </item>

      <tag><em>Configuration file</em></tag>
      <item>
        A file that contains data related to a test and/or an SUT 
	(System Under Test), e.g. protocol server addresses, client
	login details, hardware interface addresses, etc - any data
	that should be handled as variable in the suite and not
	be hardcoded.     
      </item>

      <tag><em>Configuration variable</em></tag>
      <item>
        A name (an Erlang atom) associated with a data value read from
	a configuration file.
      </item>

      <tag><em>data_dir</em></tag>
      <item>
	Data directory for a test suite. This directory contains
	any files used by the test suite, e.g. additional Erlang
	modules, binaries or data files.
      </item>

      <tag><em>Info function</em></tag>
      <item>
        A function in a test suite that returns a list of properties
	(read by the Common Test server) that describes the conditions 
	for executing the test cases in the suite. 
      </item>
      
      <tag><em>Major log file</em></tag>
      <item>
	An overview and summary log file for one or more test suites.
      </item>

      <tag><em>Minor log file</em></tag>
      <item>
	A log file for one particular test case. Also called the 
	test case log file.
      </item>
      <tag><em>priv_dir</em></tag>
      <item>
	Private directory for a test suite. This directory should
	be used when the test suite needs to write to files.
      </item>

      <tag><em>run_test</em></tag>
      <item>
        The name of an executable program that may be
	used as an interface for specifying and running
	tests with Common Test. 
      </item>

      <tag><em>Test case</em></tag>
      <item>
	A single test included in a test suite. A test case is
	implemented as a function in a test suite module.
      </item>

      <tag><em>Test case group</em></tag>
      <item>
        A set of test cases that share configuration functions and 
	execution properties. The execution properties specify whether 
	the test cases in the group should be executed in random order,
	in parallel, in sequence, and if the execution of the group 
        should be repeated. Test case groups may also be nested (i.e. a 
	group may, besides test cases, contain sub-groups).
      </item>
      
      <tag><em>Test suite</em></tag>
      <item>
	An erlang module containing a collection of test cases for
	a specific functional area.
      </item>

      <tag><em>Test directory</em></tag>
      <item>
	A directory that contains one or more test suite modules, i.e.
	a group of test suites.
      </item>

      <tag><em>The Config argument</em></tag>
      <item>
        A list of key-value tuples (i.e. a property list) containing
	runtime configuration data passed from the configuration
	functions to the test cases.
      </item>

      <tag><em>User skipped test case</em></tag>
      <item>
        This is the status of a test case that has been explicitly
	skipped in any of the ways described in the "Skipping test cases"
	section above.
      </item>
