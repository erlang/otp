	    Common Test has been updated to handle start options and
	    test specification terms for test case groups (and test
	    cases in groups). Also, an option named 'label', has been
	    added that associates the test run with a name that
	    Common Test prints in the overview HTML logs.</p>

	    It is now possible for the user to provide specific
	    callback modules that handle test configuration data, so
	    that data on arbitray form can be accessed (e.g. by
	    reading files or by communicating with a configuration
	    server process). Two default callback modules have been
	    introduced in Common Test: ct_config_plain and
	    ct_config_xml. The former is used to handle the
	    traditional Common Test configuration files (with terms
	    on key-value tuple form) and the latter to handle
	    configuration data on XML representation.</p>

	    It is now possible to execute test suites that are not
	    necessarily available on the local file system, but have
	    been loaded on the test node in advance (e.g. sent as
	    binaries from a remote node and loaded by RPC). A
	    requirement is that the no_auto_compile (or
	    {auto_compile,false}) parameter has been set.</p>

	    Test Server will now call the end_per_testcase/2 function
	    even if the test case has been terminated explicitly
	    (with abort_current_testcase/1), or after a timetrap
	    timeout. Under these circumstances the return value of
	    end_per_testcase is completely ignored. Therefore the
	    function will not be able to change the reason for test
	    case termination by returning {fail,Reason}, nor will it
	    be able to save data with {save_config,Data}.</p>

	    It is now possible to use the test specification term
	    'init' to start Common Test nodes automatically, as well
	    as have initial function calls evaluated on the nodes. A
	    default callback module for the 'init' term, ct_slave,
	    has been introduced to enable Common Test Master to
	    perform host login and node startup operations over ssh.</p>

	    The run_test script has been replaced by a program (with
	    the same name) which can be executed without explicit
	    installation. The start flags are the same as for the
	    legacy start script.</p>

	    Previously, a repeat property of a test case group
	    specified the number of times the group should be
	    repeated after the main test run. I.e. {repeat,N} would
	    case the group to execute 1+N times. To be consistent
	    with the behaviour of the run_test repeat option, this
	    has been changed. N now specifies the absolute number of
	    executions instead.</p>

	    With the run_test -erl_args option, it's possible to
	    divide the options on the run_test command line into ones
	    that Common Test should process (those preceding
	    -erl_args, and ones it should ignore (those succeeding
	    -erl_args). Options preceding -erl_args that Common Test
	    doesn't recognize are also ignored (i.e. the same
	    behaviour as earlier versions of Common Test).</p>

	    Directories added with -pa or -pz in the pre-erl_args

	    during the test run.</p>

	    The timetrap handling has been made more user
	    controllable by means of new start options and new ct
	    interface functions. With the 'multiply_timetraps' start
	    option, it's possible to specify a value which all
	    timetrap timeout values get multiplied by. This is useful
	    e.g. to extend the timetraps temporarily while running
	    cover or trace. The 'scale_timetraps' start option
	    switches on or off the Test Server timetrap scaling
	    feature (which tries to detect if the tests may benefit
	    from extended timetraps, e.g. due to running certain test
	    tools, and performs the scaling automatically).
	    Furthermore, the ct:timetrap/1 function has been
	    introduced, which makes it possible to set/reset
	    timetraps during test execution. Also, a ct:sleep/1
	    function is now available, which takes the timetrap
	    parameters into account when calculating the time to
	    suspend the process.</p>

	    A new run_test start option, event_handler_init, has been

	    <p>- A number of corrections in the generation of man
	    pages (thanks to Sergei Golovan)</p>

	    The telnet client in Common Test sent [IAC,DO,NOP] to the
	    server in attempt to keep the connection alive. This is
	    not a valid sequence according to the standard, and some
	    telnet servers would terminate the connection because of
	    it. The client has been changed to send [IAC,NOP] every
	    10 secs instead, which should be a valid sequence. The
	    client does not negotiate this type of "keep alive"
	    message with the server, and if it causes problems, the
	    user may disable the keep alive feature by adding
	    {keep_alive,false} to the telnet configuration data for
	    the server/connection. Please see the ct_telnet and
	    unix_telnet manual pages for details.</p>

	    The data field for some events, such as tc_done and
	    tc_auto_skip has been modified to make pattern matching
	    on the data easier and more consistent. Also the order in
	    which some events are received has been altered. E.g. the
	    tc_auto_skip event for a test case now comes after the
	    tc_done for the failed configuration function (not
	    before) which makes more sense. Note that no new events
	    have been added and that the event record remains

	    "&lt;testobject&gt;_test"). This has been changed so that
	    Common Test now looks for suites primarily in a test
	    sub-directory only if the directory exists. Otherwise it
	    will assume the suites are stored in the same directory
	    the user specifies with e.g. the 'dir' start flag/option.</p>

	    Test case groups have been introduced. With this feature
	    it's possible to execute groups (possibly nested) of test
	    cases, each group wrapped with a call to function
	    init_per_group/2 and end_per_group/2. Group definitions
	    are done by means of the new call-back function groups/0,
	    which should return a list of definitions. A group
	    definition contains a name tag, a list of properties and
	    a list of test cases (including possible nested group
	    definitions). The properties make it possible to execute
	    test cases in parallel, in sequence and in shuffled
	    order. It is also possible to repeat test cases according
	    to different criterias. The properties can be combined,
	    making it possible to e.g. repeat a conf case a certain
	    number of times and execute the test cases in different
	    (random) order every time. Available properties are:

            When running a test which includes all suites in a test
            directory, if the auto compilation would fail for one
            suite, all following suites would be excluded from the
            test. This was an unwanted behaviour and has been
            corrected. Now all suites will always be compiled and
            only the failing ones excluded from the test (and logged
            as missing).</p>

            The step functionality in Common Test (based on
            interaction with Debugger) was broken. This has been
            fixed, and some new step features have also been added.
            Please see the Common Test User's Guide for details.</p>

            If the Erlang runtime system was started without access
            to an erlang shell (e.g. -noshell), compilation errors
            would cause a crash in the Common Test application.
            Without access to a shell, Common Test can not prompt the
            user to choose to continue or abort the test session, but
            must assume that the session should proceed.</p>

            It is now possible for the Common Test user to disable
            the auto-compile feature. This is done by specifying the
            run_test flag -no_auto_compile, or the ct:run_test/1
            option {auto_compile,false}.</p>

            A new function, ct:get_config/3, has been added to Common
            Test that makes it possible to - if a particular config
            variable has been defined in multiple config files -
            return all matching values for the variable. The order of
            the elements in the returned list is the same as the
            specified order of the config files.</p>

            Because a telnet connection was always identified by a
            config variable alias, it was impossible to open multiple
            connections using the same telnet host data entry in the
            config file. This limitation has been removed by making
            it possible to associate a connection with handle value
            only (i.e. multiple connections may be opened using the
            same config variable). See ct_telnet:open/4 for details.</p>

            A new syntax for defining default config data values has
            been introduced. In previous versions of Common Test, to
            define and access a default value for a config variable
            (in the suite info- or test case info function), an alias
            name had to be used. With the new syntax you may define
            default values without reference to aliases, like this:
            {default_config,VarName,DefaultValue}. Please see the
            User's Guide for more info.</p>

            In previous versions of Common Test, whenever a config
            variable got associated with a name (by means of a
            require statement), the config variable name was replaced
            with the new name. This introduced unwanted dependencies
            between test cases (e.g. if one test case would introduce
            a new name, the following test cases could no longer
            access the config data by means of the original
            variable). This functionality has now been updated so
            that when new names are introduced with require, they
            become aliases (references) instead of replacements.
            Hence, config data elements can always, at any time, be
            accessed by means of the original config variable names.</p>

	    Common Test now uses the re application instead of the
	    previous rx driver to perform regular expression matching
	    on telnet strings. Since re works on all supported
	    operating systems, it is now possible to run telnet
	    sessions also on platforms such as e.g. Windows (which
	    was not the case with the previous rx driver). Note that
	    the rx driver is obsolete from now on, and will be
	    removed from Common Test after OTP R12B.</p>
