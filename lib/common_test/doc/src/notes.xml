	    This update fixes the problem with generic printouts in
	    the html log file not having special characters escaped.
	    Printouts made with <c>io:format/2</c> and
	    <c>ct:pal/2</c> will now get special characters escaped
	    automatically. Common Test will not attempt to escape
	    characters printed with <c>ct:log/2</c> since it is
	    assumed that the user may want to print html tagged data
	    using this function. A new function, <c>ct:log/5</c>, has
	    been added, which offers optional escaping of characters.
	    The latter function may also be used to print text to the
	    log without headers and CSS class wrapping (analogue to
	    <c>io:format/2</c>).</p>

	    (common_test) log directory is now used instead.</p>

	    recognize, to SSH.</p>

	    If a ssh package contained more than one netconf end tag,
	    then the second end tag was never detected in
	    ct_netconfc:handle_data. Instead it was included in the
	    XML data given to the xmerl parser, which then failed.
	    The problem was introduced by OTP-13007, and has now been
	    corrected.</p>

	    When data from the netconf server was split into many ssh
	    packages, the netconf client performed really bad. This
	    is now improved.</p>

	    In ct_netconfc, if a timer expired 'at the same time' as
	    the server sent the rpc-reply, the timeout message might
	    already be in the client's message queue when the client
	    removed the timer ref from its 'pending' list. This
	    caused a crash in the client since the timer ref could no
	    longer be found when handling the timeout message. This
	    problem is now fixed by always flushing the timeout
	    message from the message queue when canceling a timer.</p>

	    If the user would let the test run proceed after test
	    suite compilation failure, Common Test did not set the
	    exit status to indicate failure as expected. This has
	    been corrected. Also, the 'abort_if_missing_suites'
	    option now makes Common Test abort the test run without
	    asking the user if compilation fails, even if access to
	    stdin/stdout exists.</p>

	    With the Common Test 'create_priv_dir' start option set
	    to 'auto_per_tc', the name of the priv directory for a

	    Server failure. This error has been corrected.</p>

	    compilation error has changed from 'auto_skipped' to
	    'failed'. This affects both the textual log file, event

	    When running OTP tests using the ts interface, it is now
	    possible to specify so called test categories per OTP
	    application. A test category is represented by a CT test
	    specification and defines an arbitrary subset of existing
	    test suites, groups and cases. Examples of test
	    categories are 'smoke' (smoke tests) and 'bench'
	    (benchmarks). (Call ts:help() for more info). Also,
	    functions for reading terms from the current test
	    specification during test, ct:get_testspec_terms/0 and
	    ct:get_testspec_terms/1, have been implemented.</p>

	    The 'keep_alive' interval has been reduced to 8 seconds,
	    which is two seconds shorter than the default
	    'idle_timeout' value for ct_telnet:expect/3. This way,
	    the telnet server receives a NOP message (which might
	    trigger an action) before the operation times out. Also
	    the TCP option 'nodelay' has been enabled per default for
	    all telnet connections, in order to reduce the risk for
	    communication timeouts.</p>

	    If the last expression in a test case causes a timetrap
	    timeout, the stack trace is ignored and not printed to
	    the test case log file. This happens because the
	    {Suite,TestCase,Line} info is not available in the stack
	    trace in this scenario, due to tail call elimination.
	    Common Test has been modified to handle this situation by
	    inserting a {Suite,TestCase,last_expr} tuple in the
	    correct place and printing the stack trace as expected.</p>

	    The undocumented return value {skipped,Reason} from

	    When a test case (or configuration function) fails

	    termination to the CT post hook functions and the event
	    handlers (in the tc_done event). This has been changed so
	    that now the tuple {'EXIT',ReasonForProcessTermination}
	    is passed instead. This makes it much easier in the CT
	    post hook functions to distinguish a failure of this sort
	    from other types of errors and from the return value of a

	    compatible).</p>

	    The source code to html code generator in Test Server
	    (and Common Test) would fail to generate anchors in the
	    html code for functions with non-expandable macros,
	    resulting in bad html links to such functions. This
	    correction lets the code generator ignore macros that
	    can't be expanded (i.e. not pre-process them), so that
	    correct anchors will always be produced.</p>

	    The common_test telnet client, ct_telnet and friends, had
	    some unstable test cases. Some of these were caused by
	    the unix_telnet callback sending an extra newline after
	    sending the password. This caused the sever to send an
	    extra prompt back which confused the tests. The extra
	    newline is no longer sent.</p>
          <p>
	    Also, debug printouts and logging from the telnet client
	    is improved, and some test cases are slightly modified in
	    order to stabilize the test.</p>

	    The mechanism for running code cover analysis with
	    common_test has been improved. Earlier, if a test run
	    consisted of multiple tests, cover would be started and
	    stopped for each test. This would give "intermediate"
	    cover logs available from the "Coverage log" link on the
	    test suite result pages. To accumulate cover data over
	    all tests, the 'export' option had to be used in the
	    cover spec file. This was not well documented, and the
	    functionality was quite confusing.</p>
          <p>
	    Using the 'nodes' option in the cover spec file would
	    fail when the test run consisted of multiple tests, since
	    the specified nodes would only be included in the cover
	    analysis of the first test.</p>
          <p>
	    The repeated compilation and analysis of the same modules
	    was also very time consuming.</p>
          <p>
	    To overcome these problems, ct will now only cover
	    compile and analyze modules once per test run, i.e. once
	    for each cover spec file. The log file is available via a
	    new button on the top level index page. The old "Coverage
	    log" links on the test suite result pages still exist,
	    but they all point to the same log containing the
	    accumulated result.</p>

	    Common Test log cache mechanism, which has been fixed.</p>

	    <p>The way Common Test handles skipping of test cases has
	    been updated. In previous versions, returning
	    <c>{skip,Reason}</c> from a configuration function (such
	    as init_per_suite or init_per_group), resulted in all
	    affected test cases getting skipped with status
	    <c>auto_skipped</c>. This was inappropriate, since this
	    status is supposed to be used to inform that Common Test
	    has taken the initiative to skip something (e.g. a test
	    case group if init_per_group failed). Therefore, in this
	    version of Common Test, whenever the user skips a suite,
	    group, or individual test case (by means of a
	    configuration function or test specification term), the
	    affected test cases get the status <c>user_skipped</c>
	    instead.</p> <p>This update has meant a few changes that
	    may affect Common Test users in various ways:</p> <list>
	    <item>The test results and statistics will be affected,
	    which is important to know when running regression tests
	    and comparing results to previous test runs.</item>

	    pids. This problem has been solved.</p>

	    opening a new connection with the same name would make
	    common_test try to reuse the same connection since it
	    believed that it was still alive. This has been corrected

	    Integrate elliptic curve contribution from Andreas

          <p>
	    In order to be able to support elliptic curve cipher
	    suites in SSL/TLS, additions to handle elliptic curve
	    infrastructure has been added to public_key and crypto.</p>
          <p>
	    This also has resulted in a rewrite of the crypto API to
	    gain consistency and remove unnecessary overhead. All OTP
	    applications using crypto has been updated to use the new
	    API.</p>
          <p>
	    Impact: Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) offers
	    equivalent security with smaller key sizes than other
	    public key algorithms. Smaller key sizes result in
	    savings for power, memory, bandwidth, and computational
	    cost that make ECC especially attractive for constrained

	    <p>In test_server, the same process would supervise the
	    currently running test case and be group leader (and IO
	    server) for the test case. Furthermore, when running
	    parallel test cases, new temporary supervisor/group
	    leader processes were spawned and the process that was
	    group leader for sequential test cases would not be
	    active. That would lead to several problems:</p>
	    <p>* Processes started by init_per_suite will inherit the
	    group leader of the init_per_suite process (and that
	    group leader would not process IO requests when parallel
	    test cases was running). If later a parallel test case
	    caused such a processto print using (for example)
	    io:format/2, the calling would hang.</p>
	    <p>* Similarly, if a process was spawned from a parallel
	    test case, it would inherit the temporary group leader
	    for that parallel test case. If that spawned process
	    later - when the group of parallel tests have finished -
	    attempted to print something, its group leader would be
	    dead and there would be <c>badarg</c> exception.</p>
	    <p>Those problems have been solved by having group
	    leaders separate from the processes that supervises the
	    test cases, and keeping temporary group leader process
	    for parallel test cases alive until no more process in
	    the system use them as group leaders.</p>
	    <p>Also, a new <c>unexpected_io.log</c> log file
	    (reachable from the summary page of each test suite) has
	    been introduced. All unexpected IO will be printed into
	    it(for example, IO to a group leader for a parallel test
	    case that has finished).</p>

	    The following corrections/changes are done in the
	    cth_surefire hook:</p>
	    <list> <item> Earlier there would always be a
	    'properties' element under the 'testsuites' element. This
	    would exist even if there were no 'property' element
	    inside it. This has been changed so if there are no
	    'property' elements to display, then there will not be a
	    'properties' element either. </item> <item> The XML file
	    will now (unless other is specified) be stored in the top
	    log directory. Earlier, the default directory would be
	    the current working directory for the erlang node, which
	    would mostly, but not always, be the top log directory.
	    </item> <item> The 'hostname' attribute in the
	    'testsuite' element would earlier never have the correct
	    value. This has been corrected. </item> <item> The
	    'errors' attribute in the 'testsuite' element would
	    earlier display the number of failed testcases. This has
	    been changed and will now always have the value 0, while
	    the 'failures' attribute will show the number of failed
	    testcases. </item> <item> A new attribute 'skipped' is
	    added to the 'testsuite' element. This will display the
	    number of skipped testcases. These would earlier be
	    included in the number of failed test cases. </item>
	    <item> The total number of tests displayed by the 'tests'
	    attribute in the 'testsuite' element would earlier
	    include init/end_per_suite and init/end_per_group. This
	    is no longer the case. The 'tests' attribute will now
	    only count "real" test cases. </item> <item> Earlier,
	    auto skipped test cases would have no value in the 'log'
	    attribute. This is now corrected. </item> <item> A new
	    attributes 'log' is added to the 'testsuite' element.
	    </item> <item> A new option named 'url_base' is added for
	    this hook. If this option is used, a new attribute named
	    'url' will be added to the 'testcase' and 'testsuite'
	    elements. </item> </list>

	    A new test case group search functionality has been
	    implemented that makes Common Test search automatically
	    through the group definitions tree (the return value of
	    groups/0) and create tests for all paths of nested groups
	    that match the specification. It also allows for
	    specifying unique paths to sub groups in order to avoid
	    execution of unwanted tests. This new feature can be used
	    whenever starting a test run by means of the ct_run
	    program, the ct:run_test/1 API function, or a Test
	    Specification. Details can be found in the Test Case
	    Group Execution section in the Running Tests chapter.</p>

	    The Common Test documentation states that timetraps are

	    When starting a test with ct_run and adding a directory
	    to the code path using -pa or -pz (preceding -erl_args),
	    Common Test would delete any existing directory in the

	    has been fixed.</p>

	    A new optional feature has been introduced that enables
	    Common Test to generate priv_dir directory names that are
	    unique for each test case or config function. The name of
	    the option/flag is 'create_priv_dir' and it can be set to
	    value 'auto_per_run' (which is the default, existing,
	    behaviour), or 'auto_per_tc' or 'manual_per_tc'. If
	    'auto_per_tc' is used, Test Server creates a dedicated
	    priv_dir automatically for each test case (which can be
	    very expensive in case of many and/or repeated cases). If
	    'manual_per_tc' is used, the user needs to create the
	    priv_dir explicitly by calling the new function
	    ct:make_priv_dir/0.</p>

	    (analogue to the test suite- and test case info
	    function). The scope of the properties set by

	    Common Test now calls info functions also for the
	    <c>init/end_per_suite/1</c> and
	    <c>init/end_per_group/2</c> configuration functions.
	    These can be used e.g. to set timetraps and require
	    external configuration data relevant only for the
	    configuration functions in question (without affecting
	    properties set for groups and test cases in the suite).
	    The info function for <c>init/end_per_suite(Config)</c>
	    is <c>init/end_per_suite()</c>, and for
	    <c>init/end_per_group(GroupName,Config)</c> it's
	    <c>init/end_per_group(GroupName)</c>. Info functions can
	    not be used with <c>init/end_per_testcase(TestCase,
	    Config)</c>, since these configuration functions execute
	    on the test case process and will use the same properties
	    as the test case (i.e. properties set by the test case
	    info function, <c>TestCase()</c>).</p>

	    read by a pre- or post Common Test hook function). The
	    data is also sent with the event

	    Printouts to stdout may be captured during test case
	    execution. This is useful in order to e.g. read and parse
	    tty printouts from the SUT during test case execution (if
	    necessary, say, to determine the outcome of the test).
	    The capturing session is started with
	    <c>ct:capture_start/0</c>, and stopped with
	    <c>ct:capture_stop/0</c>. The list of buffered strings is
	    read and purged with <c>ct:capture_get/0/1</c>. It's
	    possible to filter out printouts made with
	    <c>ct:log/2/3</c> and <c>ct:pal/2/3</c> from the captured
	    list of strings. This is done by calling
	    <c>capture_get/1</c> with a list of log categories to

	    The syntax for specifying test case groups in the all/0

	    for both groups and sub-groups. The properties specified
	    in all/0 for a group overrides the properties specified
	    in the group declaration (in groups/0). The main purpose
	    of this extension is to make it possible to run the same
	    set of tests, but with different properties, without
	    having to declare copies of the group in question. Also,
	    the same syntax may be used in test specifications in
	    order to change properties of groups at the time of
	    execution, without having to edit the test suite. Please
	    see the User's Guide for details and examples.</p>

	    A new option, 'logopts', has been introduced, to make it
	    possible to modify some aspects of the logging behaviour
	    in Common Test (or Test Server). For example, if the html
	    version of the test suite source code should not be
	    generated during the test run (and consequently be
	    unavailable in the log file system), the feature may be
	    disabled by means of "ct_run ... -logopts no_src" (or
	    ct:run_test([..., {logopts,[no_src]}])). A new framework
	    callback function, get_logopts/0, has been introduced
	    (see the ct_framework module for details).</p>

	    CT Hooks can now be assigned a priority. The priority of

	    other CTHs. The CTH with the lowest priority will be
	    executed first, CTHs with equal priority will be executed
	    in the order which they were installed.</p>

	    It is now possible for the user to provide specific
	    callback modules that handle test configuration data, so
	    that data on arbitray form can be accessed (e.g. by
	    reading files or by communicating with a configuration
	    server process). Two default callback modules have been
	    introduced in Common Test: ct_config_plain and
	    ct_config_xml. The former is used to handle the
	    traditional Common Test configuration files (with terms
	    on key-value tuple form) and the latter to handle
	    configuration data on XML representation.</p>

	    requirement is that the no_auto_compile (or

	    end_per_testcase is completely ignored. Therefore the

	    case termination by returning {fail,Reason}, nor will it
	    be able to save data with {save_config,Data}.</p>

	    The timetrap handling has been made more user
	    controllable by means of new start options and new ct
	    interface functions. With the 'multiply_timetraps' start
	    option, it's possible to specify a value which all
	    timetrap timeout values get multiplied by. This is useful
	    e.g. to extend the timetraps temporarily while running
	    cover or trace. The 'scale_timetraps' start option
	    switches on or off the Test Server timetrap scaling
	    feature (which tries to detect if the tests may benefit
	    from extended timetraps, e.g. due to running certain test
	    tools, and performs the scaling automatically).
	    Furthermore, the ct:timetrap/1 function has been
	    introduced, which makes it possible to set/reset
	    timetraps during test execution. Also, a ct:sleep/1
	    function is now available, which takes the timetrap
	    parameters into account when calculating the time to
	    suspend the process.</p>

	    The telnet client in Common Test sent [IAC,DO,NOP] to the
	    server in attempt to keep the connection alive. This is
	    not a valid sequence according to the standard, and some
	    telnet servers would terminate the connection because of
	    it. The client has been changed to send [IAC,NOP] every
	    10 secs instead, which should be a valid sequence. The
	    client does not negotiate this type of "keep alive"
	    message with the server, and if it causes problems, the
	    user may disable the keep alive feature by adding
	    {keep_alive,false} to the telnet configuration data for
	    the server/connection. Please see the ct_telnet and

	    Various updates of the test events have been implemented.
	    The data field for some events, such as tc_done and
	    tc_auto_skip has been modified to make pattern matching
	    on the data easier and more consistent. Also the order in
	    which some events are received has been altered. E.g. the
	    tc_auto_skip event for a test case now comes after the
	    tc_done for the failed configuration function (not
	    before) which makes more sense. Note that no new events
	    have been added and that the event record remains
	    unchanged.</p>

	    sub-directory only if the directory exists. Otherwise it
	    will assume the suites are stored in the same directory
	    the user specifies with e.g. the 'dir' start flag/option.</p>

	    Test case groups have been introduced. With this feature
	    it's possible to execute groups (possibly nested) of test
	    cases, each group wrapped with a call to function
	    init_per_group/2 and end_per_group/2. Group definitions
	    are done by means of the new call-back function groups/0,
	    which should return a list of definitions. A group
	    definition contains a name tag, a list of properties and
	    a list of test cases (including possible nested group
	    definitions). The properties make it possible to execute
	    test cases in parallel, in sequence and in shuffled
	    order. It is also possible to repeat test cases according
	    to different criterias. The properties can be combined,
	    making it possible to e.g. repeat a conf case a certain
	    number of times and execute the test cases in different
	    (random) order every time. Available properties are:
	    parallel, sequence, shuffle, repeat, repeat_until_all_ok,
	    repeat_until_any_ok, repeat_until_any_fail and
	    repeat_until_all_fail. Please see the Common Test User's

            When running a test which includes all suites in a test
            directory, if the auto compilation would fail for one
            suite, all following suites would be excluded from the
            test. This was an unwanted behaviour and has been
            corrected. Now all suites will always be compiled and
            only the failing ones excluded from the test (and logged
            as missing).</p>

            If the Erlang runtime system was started without access
            to an erlang shell (e.g. -noshell), compilation errors
            would cause a crash in the Common Test application.
            Without access to a shell, Common Test can not prompt the
            user to choose to continue or abort the test session, but
            must assume that the session should proceed.</p>

            A new function, ct:get_config/3, has been added to Common
            Test that makes it possible to - if a particular config
            variable has been defined in multiple config files -
            return all matching values for the variable. The order of
            the elements in the returned list is the same as the
            specified order of the config files.</p>

            Because a telnet connection was always identified by a
            config variable alias, it was impossible to open multiple
            connections using the same telnet host data entry in the
            config file. This limitation has been removed by making
            it possible to associate a connection with handle value
            only (i.e. multiple connections may be opened using the
            same config variable). See ct_telnet:open/4 for details.</p>

            A new syntax for defining default config data values has
            been introduced. In previous versions of Common Test, to
            define and access a default value for a config variable
            (in the suite info- or test case info function), an alias
            name had to be used. With the new syntax you may define
            default values without reference to aliases, like this:
            {default_config,VarName,DefaultValue}. Please see the
            User's Guide for more info.</p>

          <p>
            In previous versions of Common Test, whenever a config
            variable got associated with a name (by means of a
            require statement), the config variable name was replaced
            with the new name. This introduced unwanted dependencies
            between test cases (e.g. if one test case would introduce
            a new name, the following test cases could no longer
            access the config data by means of the original
            variable). This functionality has now been updated so
            that when new names are introduced with require, they
            become aliases (references) instead of replacements.
            Hence, config data elements can always, at any time, be
            accessed by means of the original config variable names.</p>
