	    A new test case group search functionality has been
	    implemented that makes Common Test search automatically
	    through the group definitions tree (the return value of
	    groups/0) and create tests for all paths of nested groups
	    that match the specification. It also allows for
	    specifying unique paths to sub groups in order to avoid
	    execution of unwanted tests. This new feature can be used
	    whenever starting a test run by means of the ct_run
	    program, the ct:run_test/1 API function, or a Test
	    Specification. Details can be found in the Test Case
	    Group Execution section in the Running Tests chapter.</p>

	    If a CT hook function caused a crash, this could in some
	    situations cause Common Test to terminate due to an
	    illegal IO operation. This error has been corrected.</p>

	    The Common Test documentation states that timetraps are
	    never active during execution of CT hook functions. This
	    was only true for post hook functions, not for pre hook
	    functions. The code for CT hooks has been modified to
	    behave according to the documentation.</p>

	    If a CT hook function would call the exit/1 or throw/1
	    BIF (possibly indirectly, e.g. as a result of a timeout
	    in gen_server:call/3), Common Test would hang. This
	    problem has been fixed.</p>

	    When ct_hooks called the id/1 functions of multiple

          <p>
	    This change introduces a backwards incompatability in the
	    <c>ct:require/2</c> interface. Previously when doing
	    <c>ct:require(a_name,{key,subkey})</c>, a_name would be
	    associated with key. This has been changed to that
	    <c>a_name</c> is associated with <c>subkey</c>. This

	    It is now possible to sort the HTML tables by clicking on

	    the browser window should simply be refreshed. This
	    feature requires that the browser supports javascript,
	    and has javascript execution enabled. If the 'ct_run
	    -basic_html' flag is used, no javascript code is included
	    in the generated HTML code.</p>

	    A netconf client, ct_netconfc, is added to common_test.
	    It supports basic netconf functionality over SSH. In
	    order to allow testing of both success and failure cases,
	    it is intentionally written to allow non-standard
	    behavior.</p>

	    The test specification term {define,Constant,Value} has
	    been introduced, which makes it possible to replace
	    constant names (atom()) with values (term()) in arbitrary
	    test specification terms. The 'define' makes the (now
	    deprecated) 'alias' term obsolete. More details,
	    including examples, can be found in the Test
	    Specifications chapter in the Common Test User's Guide.</p>

	    Verbosity levels for log printouts has been added. This
	    makes it possible to specify preferred verbosity for
	    different categories of log printouts, as well as general
	    printouts (such as standard IO), to allow control over
	    which strings get printed and which get ignored. New
	    versions of the Common Test logging functions, ct:log,
	    ct:pal and ct:print, have been introduced, with a new
	    Importance argument added. The Importance value is
	    compared to the verbosity level at runtime. More
	    information can be found in the chapter about Logging in
	    the Common Test User's Guide.</p>

	    {Ok,Failed,{UserSkipped,AutoSkipped}} (all integers),
	    that presents the final test case result, or a value,
	    {error,Reason}, that informs about fatal test execution
	    failure. See details in the reference manual for ct.</p>

	    Common Test adds the test suite directories to the code

	    during a test run. This was previously not the case. Note
	    that in the top level (logdir) index file, however, only
	    the last test result is listed. For example, given the
	    test spec:
	    [{merge_tests,false},{dirs,"test1"},{dirs,"test1"}]. In
	    the index file for the test run (under
	    Logdir/ct_run.Node.Date.Time), both tests are listed. In

	    After a test case timeout or abortion, the
	    end_per_testcase function executes on a new dedicated
	    process. The group leader for this process should be set
	    to the IO server for the test case, which was not done
	    properly. The result of this error was that no warnings
	    about end_per_testcase failing or timing out were ever
	    printed in the test case log. Also, help functions such
	    as e.g. test_server:stop_node/1, attempting to

	    A new optional feature has been introduced that enables
	    Common Test to generate priv_dir directory names that are
	    unique for each test case or config function. The name of
	    the option/flag is 'create_priv_dir' and it can be set to
	    value 'auto_per_run' (which is the default, existing,
	    behaviour), or 'auto_per_tc' or 'manual_per_tc'. If
	    'auto_per_tc' is used, Test Server creates a dedicated
	    priv_dir automatically for each test case (which can be
	    very expensive in case of many and/or repeated cases). If
	    'manual_per_tc' is used, the user needs to create the
	    priv_dir explicitly by calling the new function
	    ct:make_priv_dir/0.</p>

	    ct_init_per_group/2 and ct_end_per_group/2 - when a group
	    is executed. These functions have been renamed

	    that this may affect any user event handler identifying
	    events by the old names.</p>

	    The test case group info function has been implemented in
	    Common Test. Before execution of a test case group, a
	    call is now made to <c>TestSuite:group(GroupName)</c>.
	    The function returns a list of test properties, e.g. to
	    specify timetrap values, require configuration data, etc
	    (analogue to the test suite- and test case info
	    function). The scope of the properties set by
	    <c>group(GroupName)</c> is all test cases and sub-groups
	    of group <c>GroupName</c>.</p>

	    Common Test hooks are now in a final supported version.
	    The Common Test hooks allow you to abstract out

	    suites into one place and also extend the behaviour of a
	    suite without changing the suite itself. For more
	    information see the Common Test user's guide.</p>

	    A new built-in common test hook has been added which

	    Common Test now calls info functions also for the
	    <c>init/end_per_suite/1</c> and
	    <c>init/end_per_group/2</c> configuration functions.
	    These can be used e.g. to set timetraps and require
	    external configuration data relevant only for the
	    configuration functions in question (without affecting
	    properties set for groups and test cases in the suite).
	    The info function for <c>init/end_per_suite(Config)</c>
	    is <c>init/end_per_suite()</c>, and for
	    <c>init/end_per_group(GroupName,Config)</c> it's
	    <c>init/end_per_group(GroupName)</c>. Info functions can
	    not be used with <c>init/end_per_testcase(TestCase,
	    Config)</c>, since these configuration functions execute
	    on the test case process and will use the same properties
	    as the test case (i.e. properties set by the test case
	    info function, <c>TestCase()</c>).</p>

	    It's now possible to read the full name of the test case
	    log file during execution. One way to do this is to
	    lookup it up as value of the key <c>tc_logfile</c> in the
	    test case <c>Config</c> list (which means it can also be
	    read by a pre- or post Common Test hook function). The
	    data is also sent with the event
	    <c>#event{name=tc_logfile,data={{Suite,Func},LogFileName}}</c>,
	    and can be read by any installed event handler.</p>

	    Printouts to stdout may be captured during test case
	    execution. This is useful in order to e.g. read and parse
	    tty printouts from the SUT during test case execution (if
	    necessary, say, to determine the outcome of the test).
	    The capturing session is started with
	    <c>ct:capture_start/0</c>, and stopped with
	    <c>ct:capture_stop/0</c>. The list of buffered strings is
	    read and purged with <c>ct:capture_get/0/1</c>. It's
	    possible to filter out printouts made with
	    <c>ct:log/2/3</c> and <c>ct:pal/2/3</c> from the captured
	    list of strings. This is done by calling
	    <c>capture_get/1</c> with a list of log categories to
	    exclude.</p>

	    The syntax for specifying test case groups in the all/0
	    list has been extended to include execution properties
	    for both groups and sub-groups. The properties specified
	    in all/0 for a group overrides the properties specified
	    in the group declaration (in groups/0). The main purpose
	    of this extension is to make it possible to run the same
	    set of tests, but with different properties, without
	    having to declare copies of the group in question. Also,
	    the same syntax may be used in test specifications in
	    order to change properties of groups at the time of
	    execution, without having to edit the test suite. Please
	    see the User's Guide for details and examples.</p>

	    will only return the basic file name, not the full

	    It is now possible for the user to provide specific
	    callback modules that handle test configuration data, so
	    that data on arbitray form can be accessed (e.g. by
	    reading files or by communicating with a configuration
	    server process). Two default callback modules have been
	    introduced in Common Test: ct_config_plain and
	    ct_config_xml. The former is used to handle the
	    traditional Common Test configuration files (with terms
	    on key-value tuple form) and the latter to handle
	    configuration data on XML representation.</p>

	    requirement is that the no_auto_compile (or
	    {auto_compile,false}) parameter has been set.</p>

	    (with abort_current_testcase/1), or after a timetrap
	    timeout. Under these circumstances the return value of
	    end_per_testcase is completely ignored. Therefore the
	    function will not be able to change the reason for test
	    case termination by returning {fail,Reason}, nor will it
	    be able to save data with {save_config,Data}.</p>

	    case the group to execute 1+N times. To be consistent
	    with the behaviour of the run_test repeat option, this
	    has been changed. N now specifies the absolute number of

	    The timetrap handling has been made more user
	    controllable by means of new start options and new ct
	    interface functions. With the 'multiply_timetraps' start
	    option, it's possible to specify a value which all
	    timetrap timeout values get multiplied by. This is useful
	    e.g. to extend the timetraps temporarily while running
	    cover or trace. The 'scale_timetraps' start option
	    switches on or off the Test Server timetrap scaling
	    feature (which tries to detect if the tests may benefit
	    from extended timetraps, e.g. due to running certain test
	    tools, and performs the scaling automatically).
	    Furthermore, the ct:timetrap/1 function has been
	    introduced, which makes it possible to set/reset
	    timetraps during test execution. Also, a ct:sleep/1
	    function is now available, which takes the timetrap
	    parameters into account when calculating the time to
	    suspend the process.</p>

	    The telnet client in Common Test sent [IAC,DO,NOP] to the

	    not a valid sequence according to the standard, and some
	    telnet servers would terminate the connection because of
	    it. The client has been changed to send [IAC,NOP] every
	    10 secs instead, which should be a valid sequence. The
	    client does not negotiate this type of "keep alive"
	    message with the server, and if it causes problems, the
	    user may disable the keep alive feature by adding
	    {keep_alive,false} to the telnet configuration data for
	    the server/connection. Please see the ct_telnet and

	    in an arbitrary log directory by specifying a

	    list. Also the -refresh_logs flag for the run_test script
	    has been extended to take an optional LogDir argument,
	    i.e. -refresh_logs [LogDir]. If no LogDir is specified,
	    current working directory is assumed, unless the log
	    directory is set with the -logdir flag.</p>

	    It was previously required that test suites were located
	    under a test object (or OTP application) sub-directory
	    named "test" (or under a directory named
	    "&lt;testobject&gt;_test"). This has been changed so that
	    Common Test now looks for suites primarily in a test
	    sub-directory only if the directory exists. Otherwise it
	    will assume the suites are stored in the same directory
	    the user specifies with e.g. the 'dir' start flag/option.</p>

	    Test case groups have been introduced. With this feature
	    it's possible to execute groups (possibly nested) of test
	    cases, each group wrapped with a call to function
	    init_per_group/2 and end_per_group/2. Group definitions
	    are done by means of the new call-back function groups/0,
	    which should return a list of definitions. A group
	    definition contains a name tag, a list of properties and
	    a list of test cases (including possible nested group
	    definitions). The properties make it possible to execute
	    test cases in parallel, in sequence and in shuffled
	    order. It is also possible to repeat test cases according
	    to different criterias. The properties can be combined,
	    making it possible to e.g. repeat a conf case a certain
	    number of times and execute the test cases in different
	    (random) order every time. Available properties are:
	    parallel, sequence, shuffle, repeat, repeat_until_all_ok,
	    repeat_until_any_ok, repeat_until_any_fail and
	    repeat_until_all_fail. Please see the Common Test User's
	    Guide for details.</p>

            When running a test which includes all suites in a test
            directory, if the auto compilation would fail for one
            suite, all following suites would be excluded from the
            test. This was an unwanted behaviour and has been
            corrected. Now all suites will always be compiled and
            only the failing ones excluded from the test (and logged
            as missing).</p>

            If the Erlang runtime system was started without access
            to an erlang shell (e.g. -noshell), compilation errors
            would cause a crash in the Common Test application.
            Without access to a shell, Common Test can not prompt the
            user to choose to continue or abort the test session, but
            must assume that the session should proceed.</p>

            A new function, ct:get_config/3, has been added to Common
            Test that makes it possible to - if a particular config
            variable has been defined in multiple config files -
            return all matching values for the variable. The order of
            the elements in the returned list is the same as the
            specified order of the config files.</p>

            Because a telnet connection was always identified by a
            config variable alias, it was impossible to open multiple
            connections using the same telnet host data entry in the
            config file. This limitation has been removed by making
            it possible to associate a connection with handle value
            only (i.e. multiple connections may be opened using the
            same config variable). See ct_telnet:open/4 for details.</p>

            A new syntax for defining default config data values has
            been introduced. In previous versions of Common Test, to
            define and access a default value for a config variable
            (in the suite info- or test case info function), an alias
            name had to be used. With the new syntax you may define
            default values without reference to aliases, like this:
            {default_config,VarName,DefaultValue}. Please see the
            User's Guide for more info.</p>

          <p>
            In previous versions of Common Test, whenever a config
            variable got associated with a name (by means of a
            require statement), the config variable name was replaced
            with the new name. This introduced unwanted dependencies
            between test cases (e.g. if one test case would introduce
            a new name, the following test cases could no longer
            access the config data by means of the original
            variable). This functionality has now been updated so
            that when new names are introduced with require, they
            become aliases (references) instead of replacements.
            Hence, config data elements can always, at any time, be
            accessed by means of the original config variable names.</p>

	    Common Test now uses the re application instead of the
	    previous rx driver to perform regular expression matching
	    on telnet strings. Since re works on all supported
	    operating systems, it is now possible to run telnet
	    sessions also on platforms such as e.g. Windows (which
	    was not the case with the previous rx driver). Note that
	    the rx driver is obsolete from now on, and will be
	    removed from Common Test after OTP R12B.</p>
