    <title>General Information</title>

    <p>The two main interfaces for running tests with <c>Common Test</c>
      are an executable program named 
      <seealso marker="ct_run"><c>ct_run</c></seealso> and the
      Erlang module <seealso marker="ct"><c>ct</c></seealso>. 
      <c>ct_run</c> is compiled for the underlying operating system (for example,
      Unix/Linux or Windows) during the build of the Erlang/OTP system, 
      and is installed automatically with other executable programs in
      the top level <c>bin</c> directory of Erlang/OTP.
      The <c>ct</c> interface functions can be called from the Erlang shell,
      or from any Erlang function, on any supported platform.</p>

    <p>The <c>Common Test</c> application is installed with the Erlang/OTP
      system. No extra installation step is required to start using
      <c>Common Test</c> through the <c>ct_run</c> executable program, 
      and/or the interface functions in the <c>ct</c> module.</p>
