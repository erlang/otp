    <title>General information</title>

    <p>The two main interfaces for running tests with Common Test
      are an executable program named <c>ct_run</c> and an
      erlang module named <c>ct</c>. The ct_run program
      is compiled for the underlying operating system (e.g. Unix/Linux
      or Windows) during the build of the Erlang/OTP system, and is
      installed automatically with other executable programs in
      the top level <c>bin</c> directory of Erlang/OTP.
      The <c>ct</c> interface functions can be called from the Erlang shell,
      or from any Erlang function, on any supported platform.</p>

    <p>The Common Test application is installed with the Erlang/OTP
      system and no additional installation step is required to start using
      Common Test by means of the <c>ct_run</c> executable program, and/or
      the interface functions in the <c>ct</c> module.</p>
