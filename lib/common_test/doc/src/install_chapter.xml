    <title>General information</title>

    <p>The two main interfaces for running tests with Common Test
      are an executable program named run_test and an
      erlang module named <c>ct</c>. The run_test program
      is compiled for the underlying operating system (e.g. Unix/Linux
      or Windows) during the build of the Erlang/OTP system, and is
      installed automatically with other executable programs in
      the top level <c>bin</c> directory of Erlang/OTP.
      The <c>ct</c> interface functions can be called from the Erlang shell,
      or from any Erlang function, on any supported platform.</p>

    <p>A legacy Bourne shell script - also named run_test - exists,
      which may be manually generated and installed. This script may be used
      instead of the run_test program mentioned above, e.g. if the user
      wishes to modify or customize the Common Test start flags in a simpler
      way than making changes to the run_test C program.</p>

    <p>The Common Test application is installed with the Erlang/OTP
      system and no additional installation step is required to start using
      Common Test by means of the run_test executable program, and/or the interface
      functions in the <c>ct</c> module. If you wish to use the legacy Bourne
      shell script version of run_test, however, this script needs to be
      generated first, according to the instructions below.</p>

    <p><note>Before reading on, please note that since Common Test version
	1.5, the run_test shell script is no longer required for starting
	tests with Common Test from the OS command line. The run_test
	program (descibed above) is the new recommended command line interface
	for Common Test. The shell script exists mainly for legacy reasons and
	may not be updated in future releases of Common Test. It may even be removed.
    </note></p>

    <p>Optional step to generate a shell script for starting Common Test:</p>
    <p>To generate the run_test shell script, navigate to the
      <c><![CDATA[common_test-<vsn>]]></c> directory, located among the other
      OTP applications (under the OTP lib directory). Here execute the
      <c>install.sh</c> script with argument <c>local</c>:</p>

    <p><c>
	$ ./install.sh local
    </c></p>
    
    <p>This generates the executable run_test script in the
      <c><![CDATA[common_test-<vsn>/priv/bin]]></c> directory. The script
      will include absolute paths to the Common Test and Test Server
      application directories, so it's possible to copy or move the script to
      a different location on the file system, if desired, without having to
      update it. It's of course possible to leave the script under the
      <c>priv/bin</c> directory and update the PATH variable accordingly (or
      create a link or alias to it).</p>

    <p>If you, for any reason, have copied Common Test and Test Server
      to a different location than the default OTP lib directory, you can
      generate a run_test script with a different top level directory,
      simply by specifying the directory, instead of <c>local</c>, when running
      <c>install.sh</c>. Example:</p>

    <p><c>
	$ install.sh /usr/local/test_tools
    </c></p>

    <p>Note that the <c><![CDATA[common_test-<vsn>]]></c> and
      <c><![CDATA[test_server-<vsn>]]></c> directories must be located under the
      same top directory. Note also that the install script does not copy files
      or update environment variables. It only generates the run_test
      script.</p>
    
    <p>Whenever you install a new version of Erlang/OTP, the run_test
      script needs to be regenerated, or updated manually with new directory names
      (new version numbers), for it to "see" the latest Common Test and Test Server
      versions.</p>
