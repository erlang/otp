    <title>General</title>
    <warning><p>This feature is in alpha release right now. This means that the 
	interface may change in the future and that there may be bugs. We 
	encourage you to use this feature, but be prepared 
	that there might be bugs and that the interface might change
	inbetween releases.</p></warning>
    <p>
      The <em>Common Test Hook</em> (henceforth called CTH) framework allows 
      extensions of the default behaviour of Common Test by means of hooks 
      before and after all test suite calls. CTHs allow advanced Common Test
      users to abstract out behaviour which is common to multiple test suites
      without littering all test suites with library calls. Some example 
      usages are: logging, starting and monitoring external systems, 
      building C files needed by the tests and much more!</p>

    <p>In brief, Common Test Hooks allows you to:</p>

    <list>
      <item>Manipulate the runtime config before each suite 
      configuration call</item>
      <item>Manipulate the return of all suite configuration calls and in 
      extension the result of the test themselves.</item>
    </list>
    
    <p>The following sections describe how to use CTHs, when they are run 
      and how to manipulate your test results in a CTH</p>

    <warning><p>When executing within a CTH all timetraps are shutoff. So
	if your CTH never returns, the entire test run will be stalled!</p>
    </warning>

  <marker id="installing"></marker>
  <section>
    <title>Installing a CTH</title>
    <p>There are multiple ways to install a CTH in your test run. You can do it
      for all tests in a run, for specific test suites and for specific groups 
      within a test suite. If you want a CTH to be present in all test suites 
      within your test run there are three different ways to accomplish that.
    </p>

    <list>
      <item>Add <c>-ct_hooks</c> as an argument to 
      <seealso marker="run_test_chapter#ct_run">ct_run</seealso>. 
      To add multiple CTHs using this method append them to each other
      using the keyword <c>and</c>, i.e. 
      <c>ct_run -ct_hooks cth1 [{debug,true}] and cth2 ...</c>.</item>
      <item>Add the <c>ct_hooks</c> tag to your 
      <seealso marker="run_test_chapter#test_specifications">
      Test Specification</seealso></item>
      <item>Add the <c>ct_hooks</c> tag to your call to 
      <seealso marker="ct#run_test-1">ct:run_test/1</seealso></item>
    </list>

    <p>You can also add CTHs within a test suite. This is done by returning
    <c>{ct_hooks,[CTH]}</c> in the config list from 
    <seealso marker="common_test#Module:suite-0">suite/0</seealso>,
    <seealso marker="common_test#Module:init_per_suite-1">
      init_per_suite/1</seealso> or
      <seealso marker="common_test#Module:init_per_group-2">
    init_per_group/2</seealso>. <c>CTH</c> in this case can be either
    only the module name of the CTH or a tuple with the module name and the
    initial arguments and optionally the hook priority of the CTH. Eg:
    <c>{ct_hooks,[my_cth_module]}</c> or 
    <c>{ct_hooks,[{my_cth_module,[{debug,true}]}]}</c> or 
    <c>{ct_hooks,[{my_cth_module,[{debug,true}],500}]}</c>
    </p>

    <section>
      <title>Overriding CTHs</title>
      <p>By default each installation of a CTH will cause a new instance of it
	to be activated. This can cause problems if you want to be able to 
	override CTHs in test specifications while still having them in the
	suite info function. The 
	<seealso marker="ct_hooks#Module:id-1">id/1</seealso>
	callback exists to address this problem. By returning the same
	<c>id</c> in both places, Common Test knows that this CTH
	has already been installed and will not try to install it again.</p>
    </section>
   
    <section>
      <title>CTH Priority</title>
      <p>By default each CTH installed will be executed in the order which
      they are installed. This is not always wanted so common_test allows 
      the user to specify a priority for each hook. The priority can either
      be specified in the CTH <seealso marker="ct_hooks#Module:init-2">init/2
      </seealso> function or when installing the hook. The priority given at
      installation will override the priority returned by the CTH. </p>
    </section>
  </section>

  <marker id="scope"/>
  <section>
    <title>CTH Scope</title>
    <p>Once the CTH is installed into a certain test run it will be there until
      its scope is expired. The scope of a CTH depends on when it is 
      installed.
      The <seealso marker="ct_hooks#Module:init-2">init/2</seealso> is 
      called at the beginning of the scope and the 
      <seealso marker="ct_hooks#Module:terminate-1">terminate/1
    </seealso> function is called when the scope ends.</p>

      <title>CTH Processes and Tables</title>
      <p>CTHs are run with the same process scoping as normal test suites
	i.e. a different process will execute the init_per_suite hooks then the
	init_per_group or per_testcase hooks. So if you want to spawn a 
	process in the CTH you cannot link with the CTH process as it will exit 
	after the post hook ends. Also if you for some reason need an ETS 
	table with your CTH, you will have to spawn a process which handles 
	it.</p>
    </section>

  <marker id="manipulating"/>
  <section>
    <title>Manipulating tests</title>
    <p>It is through CTHs possible to manipulate the results of tests and 
    configuration functions. The main purpose of doing this with CTHs is to
    allow common patterns to be abstracted out from test test suites and applied to
    multiple test suites without duplicating any code. All of the callback
    functions for a CTH follow a common interface, this interface is 
    described below.</p>

    <p>It is only possible to hook into test function which exists in the test 
      suite. So in order for a CTH to hook in before 
      <seealso marker="common_test#Module:init_per_suite-1">init_per_suite</seealso>, 
      the <seealso marker="common_test#Module:init_per_suite-1">init_per_suite</seealso> 
      function must exist in the test suite.</p>

    <marker id="pre"/>
    <section>
      <title>Pre Hooks</title>
      <p>
	It is possible in a CTH to hook in behaviour before 
	<seealso marker="common_test#Module:init_per_suite-1">init_per_suite</seealso>, 
	<seealso marker="common_test#Module:init_per_suite-1">init_per_group</seealso>, 
	<seealso marker="common_test#Module:init_per_suite-1">init_per_testcase</seealso>, 
	<seealso marker="common_test#Module:init_per_suite-1">end_per_group</seealso> and 
	<seealso marker="common_test#Module:init_per_suite-1">end_per_suite</seealso>. 
	This is done in the CTH functions called pre_&lt;name of function&gt;.
	All of these functions take the same three arguments: <c>Name</c>, 
	<c>Config</c> and <c>CTHState</c>. The return value of the CTH function
	is always a combination of an result for the suite/group/test and an 
	updated <c>CTHState</c>. If you want the test suite to continue on 
	executing you should return the config list which you want the test to 
	use as the result. If you for some reason want to skip/fail the test, 
	return a tuple with <c>skip</c> or <c>fail</c> and a reason as the 
	result. Example:
      </p>
      <code>pre_init_per_suite(SuiteName, Config, CTHState) -&gt;
  case db:connect() of
    {error,_Reason} -&gt;
      {{fail, "Could not connect to DB"}, CTHState};
    {ok, Handle} -&gt;
      {[{db_handle, Handle} | Config], CTHState#state{ handle = Handle }}
  end.</code>
	
    </section>
    
    <marker id="post"/>
    <section>
      <title>Post Hooks</title>
      <p>It is also possible in a CTH to hook in behaviour after 
      <seealso marker="common_test#Module:init_per_suite-1">init_per_suite</seealso>, 
      <seealso marker="common_test#Module:init_per_suite-1">init_per_group</seealso>, 
      <seealso marker="common_test#Module:init_per_suite-1">end_per_testcase</seealso>, 
      <seealso marker="common_test#Module:init_per_suite-1">end_per_group</seealso> and 
      <seealso marker="common_test#Module:init_per_suite-1">end_per_suite</seealso>.
      This is done in the CTH functions called post_&lt;name of function&gt;. 
      All of these function take the same four arguments: <c>Name</c>, 
      <c>Config</c>, <c>Return</c> and <c>CTHState</c>. <c>Config</c> in this
      case is the same <c>Config</c> as the testcase is called with. 
      <c>Return</c> is the value returned by the testcase. If the testcase 
      failed by crashing, <c>Return</c> will be 
      <c>{'EXIT',{{Error,Reason},Stacktrace}}</c>.</p>
      
      <p>The return value of the CTH function is always a combination of an
	result for the suite/group/test and an updated <c>CTHState</c>. If
	you want the callback to not affect the outcome of the test you should
	return the <c>Return</c> data as it is given to the CTH. You can also
	modify the result of the test. By returning the <c>Config</c> list
	with the <c>tc_status</c> element removed you can recover from a test 
	failure. As in all the pre hooks, it is also possible to fail/skip
	the test case in the post hook. Example: </p>

      <code>post_end_per_testcase(_TC, Config, {'EXIT',{_,_}}, CTHState) -&gt;
  case db:check_consistency() of
    true ->
      %% DB is good, pass the test.
      {proplists:delete(tc_status, Config), CTHState};
    false ->
      %% DB is not good, mark as skipped instead of failing
      {{skip, "DB is inconsisten!"}, CTHState}
  end;
post_end_per_testcase(_TC, Config, Return, CTHState) -&gt;
  %% Do nothing if tc does not crash.
  {Return, CTHState}.</code>

      <note>Recovering from a testcase failure using CTHs should only be done as
	a last resort. If used wrongly it could become very difficult to 
	determine which tests pass or fail in a test run</note>
  
    </section>

    <marker id="skip_n_fail"/>
    <section>
      <title>Skip and Fail hooks</title>
      <p>
	After any post hook has been executed for all installed CTHs, 
	<seealso marker="ct_hooks#Module:on_tc_fail-3">on_tc_fail</seealso>
	or <seealso marker="ct_hooks#Module:on_tc_fail-3">on_tc_skip</seealso> 
	might be called if the testcase failed or was skipped 
	respectively. You cannot affect the outcome of the tests any further at 
	this point.
