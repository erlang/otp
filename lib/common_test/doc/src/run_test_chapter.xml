    <title>Using the Common Test Framework</title>

    <p>The Common Test Framework provides a high level
    operator interface for testing. It adds the following features to
    the Erlang/OTP Test Server:</p>

    <list>
	<item>Automatic compilation of test suites (and help modules).</item>
	<item>Creation of additional HTML pages for better overview.</item>
	<item>Single command interface for running all available tests.</item>
	<item>Handling of configuration files specifying data related to
	  the System Under Test (and any other variable data).</item>
	<item>Mode for running multiple independent test sessions in parallel with
	  central control and configuration.</item>	
      </list>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Automatic compilation of test suites and help modules</title>
    <p>When Common Test starts, it will automatically attempt to compile any
      suites included in the specified tests. If particular
      suites have been specified, only those suites will be compiled. If a
      particular test object directory has been specified (meaning all suites
      in this directory should be part of the test), Common Test runs
      make:all/1 in the directory to compile the suites.</p>

    <p>If compilation should fail for one or more suites, the compilation errors
      are printed to tty and the operator is asked if the test run should proceed
      without the missing suites, or be aborted. If the operator chooses to proceed, 
      it is noted in the HTML log which tests have missing suites. If Common Test is
      unable to prompt the user after compilation failure (if Common Test doesn't
      control stdin), the test run will proceed automatically without the missing
      suites. This behaviour can however be modified with the
      <c><![CDATA[ct_run]]></c> flag <c><![CDATA[-abort_if_missing_suites]]></c>, 
      or the <c><![CDATA[ct:run_test/1]]></c> option
      <c><![CDATA[{abort_if_missing_suites,TrueOrFalse}]]></c>. If 
      <c><![CDATA[abort_if_missing_suites]]></c> is set (to true), the test run
      will stop immediately if some suites fail to compile.</p>

    <p>Any help module (i.e. regular Erlang module with name not ending with
      "_SUITE") that resides in the same test object directory as a suite 
      which is part of the test, will also be automatically compiled. A help
      module will not be mistaken for a test suite (unless it has a "_SUITE"
      name of course). All help modules in a particular test object directory
      are compiled no matter if all or only particular suites in the directory 
      are part of the test.</p>

    <p>If test suites or help modules include header files stored in other
      locations than the test directory, you may specify these include directories
      by means of the <c><![CDATA[-include]]></c> flag with <c><![CDATA[ct_run]]></c>, 
      or the <c><![CDATA[include]]></c> option with <c><![CDATA[ct:run_test/1]]></c>.
      In addition to this, an include path may be specified with an OS
      environment variable; <c><![CDATA[CT_INCLUDE_PATH]]></c>. Example (bash):</p>

    <p><c>$ export CT_INCLUDE_PATH=~testuser/common_suite_files/include:~testuser/common_lib_files/include</c></p>

    <p>Common Test will pass all include directories (specified either with the
      <c><![CDATA[include]]></c> flag/option, or the <c><![CDATA[CT_INCLUDE_PATH]]></c>
      variable, or both) to the compiler.</p>

    <p>It is also possible to specify include directories in test specifications 
      (see below).</p>

    <p>If the user wants to run all test suites for a test object (or OTP application)
      by specifying only the top directory (e.g. with the <c>dir</c> start flag/option),
      Common Test will primarily look for test suite modules in a subdirectory named 
      <c>test</c>. If this subdirectory doesn't exist, the specified top directory
      is assumed to be the actual test directory, and test suites will be read from
      there instead.</p>

    <p>It is possible to disable the automatic compilation feature by using the
      <c><![CDATA[-no_auto_compile]]></c> flag with <c><![CDATA[ct_run]]></c>, or
      the <c><![CDATA[{auto_compile,false}]]></c> option with 
      <c><![CDATA[ct:run_test/1]]></c>. With automatic compilation
      disabled, the user is responsible for compiling the test suite modules 
      (and any help modules) before the test run. If the modules can not be loaded
      from the local file system during startup of Common Test, the user needs to
      pre-load the modules before starting the test. Common Test will only verify
      that the specified test suites exist (i.e. that they are, or can be, loaded).
      This is useful e.g. if the test suites are transferred and loaded as binaries via
      RPC from a remote node.</p>

  <marker id="ct_run"></marker>
    <title>Running tests from the OS command line</title>
    
    <p>The <c>ct_run</c> program can be used for running tests from
      the OS command line, e.g.
    </p>
    <list>
      <item><c><![CDATA[ct_run -config <configfilenames> -dir <dirs>]]></c></item>
      <item><c><![CDATA[ct_run -config <configfilenames> -suite <suiteswithfullpath>]]></c>
      </item>
      <item><c><![CDATA[ct_run -userconfig <callbackmodulename> <configfilenames> -suite <suiteswithfullpath>]]></c>
      </item>
      <item><c><![CDATA[ct_run -config <configfilenames> -suite <suitewithfullpath>
	      -group <groups> -case <casenames>]]></c></item>
    </list>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <p><c>$ ct_run -config $CFGS/sys1.cfg $CFGS/sys2.cfg -dir $SYS1_TEST $SYS2_TEST</c></p>
    <p><c>$ ct_run -userconfig ct_config_xml $CFGS/sys1.xml $CFGS/sys2.xml -dir $SYS1_TEST $SYS2_TEST</c></p>
    <p><c>$ ct_run -suite $SYS1_TEST/setup_SUITE $SYS2_TEST/config_SUITE</c></p>
    <p><c>$ ct_run -suite $SYS1_TEST/setup_SUITE -case start stop</c></p>
    <p><c>$ ct_run -suite $SYS1_TEST/setup_SUITE -group installation -case start stop</c></p>
    
    <p>It is also possible to combine the <c>dir</c>, <c>suite</c> and <c>group/case</c> flags. E.g, to run
    <c>x_SUITE</c> and <c>y_SUITE</c> in directory <c>testdir</c>:</p>

    <p><c>$ ct_run -dir ./testdir -suite x_SUITE y_SUITE</c></p>

    <p>This has the same effect as calling:</p>

    <p><c>$ ct_run -suite ./testdir/x_SUITE ./testdir/y_SUITE</c></p>

    <p>For more details on <seealso marker="run_test_chapter#group_execution">test case group execution</seealso>, please see below.</p>

    </list>

    <note><p>Directories passed to Common Test may have either relative or absolute paths.</p></note>

    <note><p>Arbitrary start flags to the Erlang Runtime System may also be passed as
             parameters to <c>ct_run</c>. It is, for example, useful to be able to
	     pass directories that should be added to the Erlang code server search path
	     with the <c>-pa</c> or <c>-pz</c> flag. If you have common help- or library 
	     modules for test suites (separately compiled), stored in other directories 
	     than the test suite directories, these help/lib directories are preferrably
	     added to the code path this way. Example:</p>
	  <p><c>$ ct_run -dir ./chat_server -logdir ./chat_server/testlogs -pa $PWD/chat_server/ebin</c></p>
	  <p>Note how in this example, the absolute path of the <c>chat_server/ebin</c>
	     directory is passed to the code server. This is essential since relative
	     paths are stored by the code server as relative, and Common Test changes 
	     the current working directory of the Erlang Runtime System during the test run!</p>
    </note>
    
    <p>The <c>ct_run</c> program sets the exit status before shutting down. The following values
      are defined:</p>
    <list>
      <item><c>0</c> indicates a successful testrun, i.e. one without failed or auto skipped test cases.</item>
      <item><c>1</c> indicates that one or more test cases have failed, or have been auto skipped.</item>
      <item><c>2</c> indicates that the test execution has failed because of e.g. compilation errors, an
	illegal return value from an info function, etc.</item>
    </list>
    <p>If auto skipped test cases should not affect the exit status, you may change the default
      behaviour using start flag:</p>
    <pre>-exit_status ignore_config</pre>
    
    <note><p>Executing <c>ct_run</c> without start flags, is equal to the command:
    <c>ct_run -dir ./</c></p></note>

    <p>For more information about the <c>ct_run</c> program, see the
      <seealso marker="ct_run">Reference Manual</seealso> and the
      <seealso marker="install_chapter#general">Installation</seealso> chapter.

  <section>
    <title>Running tests from the Erlang shell or from an Erlang program</title>
    
    <p>Common Test provides an Erlang API for running tests. The main (and most
      flexible) function for specifying and executing tests is called
      <seealso marker="ct#run_test-1"><c>ct:run_test/1</c></seealso>.
      This function takes the same start parameters as
      the <seealso marker="run_test_chapter#ct_run"><c>ct_run</c></seealso>
      program described above, only the flags are instead
      given as options in a list of key-value tuples. E.g. a test specified 
      with <c>ct_run</c> like:</p>

      <p><c>$ ct_run -suite ./my_SUITE -logdir ./results</c></p> 
      <p>is with <seealso marker="ct#run_test-1"><c>ct:run_test/1</c></seealso> specified as:</p>
      <p><c>1> ct:run_test([{suite,"./my_SUITE"},{logdir,"./results"}]).</c></p>

      <p>The function returns the test result, represented by the tuple:
	<c>{Ok,Failed,{UserSkipped,AutoSkipped}}</c>, where each element is an
	integer. If test execution fails, the function returns the tuple:
	<c>{error,Reason}</c>, where the term <c>Reason</c> explains the
	failure.</p>

      <p>The default start option <c>{dir,Cwd}</c> (run all suites in the current
      working directory) is used if the function is called with an empty
      list of options.</p>

	<section>
	  <title>Releasing the Erlang shell</title>
	  <p>During execution of tests, started with
	  <seealso marker="ct#run_test-1"><c>ct:run_test/1</c></seealso>,
	  the Erlang shell process, controlling stdin, will remain the top
	  level process of the Common Test system of processes. The result
	  is that the Erlang shell is not available for interaction during
	  the test run. If this is not desirable, maybe because the shell is needed
	  for debugging purposes or for interaction with the SUT during test
	  execution, you may set the <c>release_shell</c> start option to
	  <c>true</c> (in the call to <c>ct:run_test/1</c> or by
	  using the corresponding test specification term, see below). This will
	  make Common Test release the shell immediately after the test suite
	  compilation stage. To accomplish this, a test runner process
	  is spawned to take control of the test execution, and the effect is that
	  <c>ct:run_test/1</c> returns the pid of this process rather than the
	  test result - which instead is printed to tty at the end of the test run.</p>
	  <note><p>Note that in order to use the
	  <seealso marker="ct#break-1"><c>ct:break/1/2</c></seealso> and
	  <seealso marker="ct#continue-0"><c>ct:continue/0/1</c></seealso> functions,
	  <c>release_shell</c> <em>must</em> be set to <c>true</c>.</p></note>

    <marker id="group_execution"></marker>
    <title>Test case group execution</title>
    
    <p>With the <c>ct_run</c> flag, or <c>ct:run_test/1</c> option <c>group</c>,
    one or more test case groups can be specified, optionally in combination
    with specific test cases. The syntax for specifying groups is as follows
    (on the command line):</p>

    <pre>
      <![CDATA[$ ct_run -group <group_names_or_paths> [-case <cases>]]]></pre>
    <p>or (in the Erlang shell):</p>
    <pre>
      <![CDATA[1> ct:run_test([{group,GroupsNamesOrPaths}, {case,Cases}]).]]></pre>
    
    <p>The <c>group_names_or_paths</c> parameter specifies either one
    or more group names and/or one or more group paths. At start up,
    Common Test will search for matching groups in the group definitions
    tree (i.e. the list returned from <c>Suite:groups/0</c>, please see the
    <seealso marker="write_test_chapter#test_case_groups">Test case groups</seealso>
    chapter for details).
    Given a group name, say <c>g</c>, Common Test will search for all paths
    that lead to <c>g</c>. By path here we mean a sequence of nested groups,
    all of which have to be followed in order to get from the top level
    group to <c>g</c>. Actually, what Common Test needs to do in order to
    execute the test cases in group <c>g</c>, is to call the
    <c>init_per_group/2</c> function for each group in the path to
    <c>g</c>, as well as all corresponding <c>end_per_group/2</c>
    functions afterwards. The obvious reason for this is that the configuration
    of a test case in <c>g</c> (and its <c>Config</c> input data) depends on
    <c>init_per_testcase(TestCase, Config)</c> and its return value, which
    in turn depends on <c>init_per_group(g, Config)</c> and its return value,
    which in turn depends on <c>init_per_group/2</c> of the group above
    <c>g</c>, etc, all the way up to the top level group.</p>

    <p>As you may have already realized, this means that if there is more than
    one way to locate a group (and its test cases) in a path, the result of the
    group search operation is a number of tests, all of which will be performed.
    Common Test actually interprets a group specification that consists of a
    single name this way:</p>

    <p>"Search and find all paths in the group definitions tree that lead
    to the specified group and, for each path, create a test which (1) executes
    all configuration functions in the path to the specified group, then (2)
    executes all - or all matching - test cases in this group, as well as (3)
    all - or all matching - test cases in all sub groups of the group".
    </p>
    
    <p>It is also possible for the user to specify a specific group path with
    the <c>group_names_or_paths</c> parameter. With this type of specification it's
    possible to avoid execution of unwanted groups (in otherwise matching paths),
    and/or the execution of sub groups. The syntax of the group path is a list of
    group names in the path, e.g. on the command line:
    </p>
    <p><c>$ ct_run -suite "./x_SUITE" -group [g1,g3,g4] -case tc1 tc5</c></p>
    <p>or similarly in the Erlang shell (requires a list within the groups list):</p>
    <p><c>1> ct:run_test([{suite,"./x_SUITE"}, {group,[[g1,g3,g4]]}, {testcase,[tc1,tc5]}]).</c></p>
    
    <p>The last group in the specified path will be the terminating group in
    the test, i.e. no sub groups following this group will be executed. In the
    example above, <c>g4</c> is the terminating group, hence Common Test will
    execute a test that calls all init configuration functions in the path to
    <c>g4</c>, i.e. <c>g1..g3..g4</c>. It will then call test cases <c>tc1</c>
    and <c>tc5</c> in <c>g4</c> and finally all end configuration functions in order
    <c>g4..g3..g1</c>.</p>
    
    <p>Note that the group path specification doesn't necessarily
    have to include <em>all</em> groups in the path to the terminating group.
    Common Test will search for all matching paths if given an incomplete group
    path.</p>
    
    <p>Note also that it's possible to combine group names and group paths with the
    <c>group_names_or_paths</c> parameter. Each element is treated as
    an individual specification in combination with the <c>cases</c> parameter.
    See examples below.</p>    

    <p>Examples:</p>
    <pre>
      -module(x_SUITE).
      ...
      %% The group definitions:      
      groups() ->
        [{top1,[],[tc11,tc12,
	           {sub11,[],[tc12,tc13]},
	           {sub12,[],[tc14,tc15,
			      {sub121,[],[tc12,tc16]}]}]},

         {top2,[],[{group,sub21},{group,sub22}]},
         {sub21,[],[tc21,{group,sub2X2}]},
         {sub22,[],[{group,sub221},tc21,tc22,{group,sub2X2}]},
         {sub221,[],[tc21,tc23]},
         {sub2X2,[],[tc21,tc24]}].
    </pre>
    <br></br>
    <p><c>$ ct_run -suite "x_SUITE" -group all</c></p>
    <p><c>1> ct:run_test([{suite,"x_SUITE"}, {group,all}]).</c></p>
    <p>Two tests will be executed, one for all cases and all sub groups under <c>top1</c>,
    and one for all under <c>top2</c>. (We would get the same result with
    <c>-group top1 top2</c>, or <c>{group,[top1,top2]}</c>.</p>
    <br></br>
    <p><c>$ ct_run -suite "x_SUITE" -group top1</c></p>
    <p><c>1> ct:run_test([{suite,"x_SUITE"}, {group,[top1]}]).</c></p>
    <p>This will execute one test for all cases and sub groups under <c>top1</c>.</p>
    <br></br>
    <p><c>$ ct_run -suite "x_SUITE" -group top1 -case tc12</c></p>
    <p><c>1> ct:run_test([{suite,"x_SUITE"}, {group,[top1]}, {testcase,[tc12]}]).</c></p>
    <p>This will run a test that executes <c>tc12</c> in <c>top1</c> and any sub group
    under <c>top1</c> where it can be found (<c>sub11</c> and <c>sub121</c>).</p>
    <br></br>
    <p><c>$ ct_run -suite "x_SUITE" -group [top1] -case tc12</c></p>
    <p><c>1> ct:run_test([{suite,"x_SUITE"}, {group,[[top1]]}, {testcase,[tc12]}]).</c></p>
    <p>This will execute <c>tc12</c> <em>only</em> in group <c>top1</c>.</p>
    <br></br>
    <p><c>$ ct_run -suite "x_SUITE" -group top1 -case tc16</c></p>
    <p><c>1> ct:run_test([{suite,"x_SUITE"}, {group,[top1]}, {testcase,[tc16]}]).</c></p>
    <p>This will search <c>top1</c> and all its sub groups for <c>tc16</c> and the result
    will be that this test case executes in group <c>sub121</c>. (The specific path: 
    <c>-group [sub121]</c> or <c>{group,[[sub121]]}</c>, would have given
    us the same result in this example).</p>
    <br></br>
    <p><c>$ ct_run -suite "x_SUITE" -group sub12 [sub12]</c></p>
    <p><c>1> ct:run_test([{suite,"x_SUITE"}, {group,[sub12,[sub12]]}]).</c></p>
    <p>This will execute two tests, one that includes all cases and sub groups under
    <c>sub12</c>, and one with <em>only</em> the test cases in <c>sub12</c>.</p>
    <br></br>
    <p><c>$ ct_run -suite "x_SUITE" -group sub2X2</c></p>
    <p><c>1> ct:run_test([{suite,"x_SUITE"}, {group,[sub2X2]}]).</c></p>
    <p>In this example, Common Test will find and execute two tests, one for the path from
    <c>top2</c> to <c>sub2X2</c> via <c>sub21</c>, and one from <c>top2</c> to <c>sub2X2</c>
    via <c>sub22</c>.</p>
    <br></br>
    <p><c>$ ct_run -suite "x_SUITE" -group [sub21,sub2X2]</c></p>
    <p><c>1> ct:run_test([{suite,"x_SUITE"}, {group,[[sub21,sub2X2]]}]).</c></p>
    <p>Here, by specifying the unique path: <c>top2 -> sub21 -> sub2X2</c>, only one test
    is executed. The second possible path from <c>top2</c> to <c>sub2X2</c> (above)
    will be discarded.</p>
    <br></br>
    <p><c>$ ct_run -suite "x_SUITE" -group [sub22] -case tc22 tc21</c></p>
    <p><c>1> ct:run_test([{suite,"x_SUITE"}, {group,[[sub22]]}, {testcase,[tc22,tc21]}]).</c></p>
    <p>In this example only the test cases for <c>sub22</c> will be executed, and in
    reverse order compared to the group definition.</p>
    <br></br>

    <p>If a test case that belongs to a group (according to the group definition), is executed
    without a group specification, i.e. simply by means of (command line):</p>
    <p><c>$ ct_run -suite "my_SUITE" -case my_tc</c></p>
    <p>or (Erlang shell):</p>
    <p><c>1> ct:run_test([{suite,"my_SUITE"}, {testcase,my_tc}]).</c></p>
    <p>then Common Test ignores the group definition and executes the test case in the scope of the
    test suite only (no group configuration functions are called).</p>

    <p>The group specification feature, exactly as it has been presented in this section, can also
    be used in <seealso marker="run_test_chapter#test_specifications">Test
    Specifications</seealso> (with some extra features added). Please see below.</p>
   </section>
      

  <section>
    <title>Running the interactive shell mode</title>
    
    <p>You can start Common Test in an interactive shell mode where no
      automatic testing is performed. Instead, in this mode, Common Test
      starts its utility processes, installs configuration data (if any),
      and waits for the user to call functions (typically test case support
      functions) from the Erlang shell.</p>

    <p>The shell mode is useful e.g. for debugging test suites, for analysing
      and debugging the SUT during "simulated" test case execution, and 
      for trying out various operations during test suite development.</p>

    <p>To invoke the interactive shell mode, you can start an Erlang shell 
      manually and call <seealso marker="ct#install-1"><c>ct:install/1</c></seealso> to install any configuration
      data you might need (use <c>[]</c> as argument otherwise), then
      call <seealso marker="ct#start_interactive-0"><c>ct:start_interactive/0</c></seealso> to start Common Test. If you use
      the <c>ct_run</c> program, you may start the Erlang shell and Common Test
      in the same go by using the <c>-shell</c> and, optionally, the <c>-config</c>
      and/or <c>-userconfig</c> flag. Examples:
    </p>
    <list>
      <item><c>ct_run -shell</c></item>
      <item><c><![CDATA[ct_run -shell -config cfg/db.cfg]]></c></item>
      <item><c><![CDATA[ct_run -shell -userconfig db_login testuser x523qZ]]></c></item>
    </list>
    
    <p>If no config file is given with the <c>ct_run</c> command,
      a warning will be displayed. If Common Test has been run from the same
      directory earlier, the same config file(s) will be used
      again. If Common Test has not been run from this directory before, no
      config files will be available.</p>
    
    <p>If any functions using "required config data" (e.g. ct_telnet or
      ct_ftp functions) are to be called from the erlang shell, config
      data must first be required with <seealso marker="ct#require-1"><c>
      ct:require/1/2</c></seealso>. This is
      equivalent to a <c>require</c> statement in the <seealso
	marker="write_test_chapter#suite">Test Suite Info 
	Function</seealso> or in the <seealso
	marker="write_test_chapter#info_function">Test Case Info
	Function</seealso>.</p>
    
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre> 
       1> ct:require(unix_telnet, unix).
       ok
       2> ct_telnet:open(unix_telnet).
       {ok,&lt;0.105.0&gt;}
       4> ct_telnet:cmd(unix_telnet, "ls .").
       {ok,["ls .","file1  ...",...]}
    </pre>
    
    <p>Everything that Common Test normally prints in the test case logs,
      will in the interactive mode be written to a log named
      <c>ctlog.html</c> in the <c><![CDATA[ct_run.<timestamp>]]></c>
      directory. A link to this file will be available in the file
      named <c>last_interactive.html</c> in the directory from which
      you executed <c>ct_run</c>. Currently, specifying a different
      root directory for the logs than the current working directory,
      is not supported.</p>
    
    <p>If you wish to exit the interactive mode (e.g. to start an
      automated test run with <seealso marker="ct#run_test-1"><c>ct:run_test/1</c></seealso>), call the function
      <seealso marker="ct#stop_interactive-0"><c>ct:stop_interactive/0</c></seealso>. This shuts down the
      running <c>ct</c> application. Associations between
      configuration names and data created with <c>require</c> are 
      consequently deleted. <seealso marker="ct#start_interactive-0"><c>ct:start_interactive/0</c></seealso> will get you
      back into interactive mode, but the previous state is not restored.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Step by step execution of test cases with the Erlang Debugger</title>
   
    <p>By means of <c>ct_run -step [opts]</c>, or by passing the 
       <c>{step,Opts}</c> option to <seealso marker="ct#run_test-1"><c>ct:run_test/1</c></seealso>, it is possible
       to get the Erlang Debugger started automatically and use its
       graphical interface to investigate the state of the current test 
       case and to execute it step by step and/or set execution breakpoints.</p>
    <p>If no extra options are given with the <c>step</c> flag/option,
       breakpoints will be set automatically on the test cases that
       are to be executed by Common Test, and those functions only. If
       the step option <c>config</c> is specified, breakpoints will 
       also be initially set on the configuration functions in the suite, i.e.
       <c>init_per_suite/1</c>, <c>end_per_suite/1</c>,
       <c>init_per_group/2</c>, <c>end_per_group/2</c>,
       <c>init_per_testcase/2</c> and <c>end_per_testcase/2</c>.</p>
    <p>Common Test enables the Debugger auto attach feature, which means
       that for every new interpreted test case function that starts to execute, 
       a new trace window will automatically pop up. (This is because each test 
       case executes on a dedicated Erlang process). Whenever a new test case starts,
       Common Test will attempt to close the inactive trace window of the previous 
       test case. However, if you prefer that Common Test leaves inactive trace 
       windows, use the <c>keep_inactive</c> option.</p>
    <p>The step functionality can be used together with the <c>suite</c> and 
       the <c>suite</c> + <c>case/testcase</c> flag/option, but not together 
       with <c>dir</c>.</p>

    <title>Test Specifications</title>
    <section>
	<title>General description</title>
	<p>The most flexible way to specify what to test, is to use a so
	called test specification. A test specification is a sequence of
	Erlang terms. The terms are normally declared in one or more text files
	(see <seealso marker="ct#run_test-1"><c>ct:run_test/1</c></seealso>), but
	may also be passed to Common Test on the form of a list (see
	<seealso marker="ct#run_testspec-1"><c>ct:run_testspec/1</c></seealso>).
	There are two general types of terms: configuration terms and test
	specification terms.</p>
	<p>With configuration terms it is possible to e.g. label the test
	run (similar to <c>ct_run -label</c>), evaluate arbitrary expressions
	before starting the test, import configuration data (similar to
	<c>ct_run -config/-userconfig</c>), specify the top level HTML log
	directory (similar to <c>ct_run -logdir</c>), enable code coverage
	analysis (similar to <c>ct_run -cover</c>), install Common Test Hooks
	(similar to <c>ct_run -ch_hooks</c>), install event_handler plugins
	(similar to <c>ct_run -event_handler</c>), specify include directories
	that should be passed to the compiler for automatic compilation
	(similar to <c>ct_run -include</c>), disable the auto compilation
	feature (similar to <c>ct_run -no_auto_compile</c>), set verbosity
	levels (similar to <c>ct_run -verbosity</c>), and more.</p>
	<p>Configuration terms can be combined with <c>ct_run</c> start flags,
	or <c>ct:run_test/1</c> options. The result will for some flags/options
	and terms be that the values are merged (e.g. configuration files,
	include directories, verbosity levels, silent connections), and for
	others that the start flags/options override the test specification
	terms (e.g. log directory, label, style sheet, auto compilation).</p>
	<p>With test specification terms it is possible to state exactly
	which tests should run and in which order. A test term specifies
	either one or more suites, one or more test case groups (possibly nested),
	or one or more test cases in a group (or in multiple groups) or in a suite.</p>
	<p>An arbitrary number of test terms may be declared in sequence.
	Common Test will by default compile the terms into one or more tests 
	to be performed in one resulting test run. Note that a term that
	specifies a set of test cases will "swallow" one that only
	specifies a subset of these cases. E.g. the result of merging
	one term that specifies that all cases in suite S should be
	executed, with another term specifying only test case X and Y in
	S, is a test of all cases in S. However, if a term specifying
	test case X and Y in S is merged with a term specifying case Z
	in S, the result is a test of X, Y and Z in S. To disable this
	behaviour, i.e. to instead perform each test sequentially in a "script-like"
	manner, the term <c>merge_tests</c> can be set to <c>false</c> in
	the test specification.</p>
	<p>A test term can also specify one or more test suites, groups,
	or test cases to be skipped. Skipped suites, groups and cases
	are not executed and show up in the HTML log files as
	SKIPPED.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Using multiple test specification files</title>
	
	<p>When multiple test specification files are given at startup (either
	with <c>ct_run -spec file1 file2 ...</c> or 
	<c>ct:run_test([{spec, [File1,File2,...]}])</c>), 
	Common Test will either execute one test run per specification file, or
	join the files and perform all tests within one single test run. The first
	behaviour is the default one. The latter requires that the start
	flag/option <c>join_specs</c> is provided, e.g.
	<c>run_test -spec ./my_tests1.ts ./my_tests2.ts -join_specs</c>.</p>
	
	<p>Joining a number of specifications, or running them separately, can
	also be accomplished with (and may be combined with) test specification
	file inclusion, described next.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Test specification file inclusion</title>
        <p>With the <c>specs</c> term (see syntax below), it's possible to have
	a test specification include other specifications. An included
	specification may either be joined with the source specification,
	or used to produce a separate test run (like with the <c>join_specs</c>
	start flag/option above). Example:</p>
	<pre>
	%% In specification file "a.spec"
	{specs, join, ["b.spec", "c.spec"]}.
	{specs, separate, ["d.spec", "e.spec"]}.
	%% Config and test terms follow
	...</pre>
	<p>In this example, the test terms defined in files "b.spec" and "c.spec"
	will be joined with the terms in the source specification "a.spec"
	(if any). The inclusion of specifications "d.spec" and
	"e.spec" will result in two separate, and independent, test runs (i.e.
	one for each included specification).</p>
	<p>Note that the <c>join</c> option does not imply that the test terms
	will be merged (see <c>merge_tests</c> above), only that all tests are
	executed in one single test run.</p>
	<p>Joined specifications share common configuration settings, such as
	the list of <c>config</c> files or <c>include</c> directories.
	For configuration that can not be combined, such as settings for <c>logdir</c>
	or <c>verbosity</c>, it is up to the user to ensure there are no clashes
	when the test specifications are joined. Specifications included with
	the <c>separate</c> option, do not share configuration settings with the
	source specification. This is useful e.g. if there are clashing
	configuration settings in included specifications, making it impossible
	to join them.</p>
	<p>If <c>{merge_tests,true}</c> is set in the source specification
	(which is the default setting), terms in joined specifications will be
	merged with terms in the source specification (according to the
	description of <c>merge_tests</c> above).</p>
	<p>Note that it is always the <c>merge_tests</c> setting in the source
	specification that is used when joined with other specifications.
	Say e.g. that a source specification A, with tests TA1 and TA2, has
	<c>{merge_tests,false}</c> set, and it includes another specification,
	B, with tests TB1 and TB2, that has <c>{merge_tests,true}</c> set.
	The result will be that the test series: <c>TA1,TA2,merge(TB1,TB2)</c>,
	is executed. The opposite <c>merge_tests</c> settings would result in the
	following the test series: <c>merge(merge(TA1,TA2),TB1,TB2)</c>.</p>
	<p>The <c>specs</c> term may of course be used to nest specifications,
	i.e. have one specification include other specifications, which in turn
	include others, etc.</p>
    </section>
      <section>
	<title>Test case groups</title>

	<p>When a test case group is specified, the resulting test
	executes the <c>init_per_group</c> function, followed by all test
	cases and sub groups (including their configuration functions), and
	finally the <c>end_per_group</c> function. Also if particular
	test cases in a group are specified, <c>init_per_group</c>
	and <c>end_per_group</c> for the group in question are
	called. If a group which is defined (in <c>Suite:group/0</c>) to
	be a sub group of another group, is specified (or if particular test
	cases of a sub group are), Common Test will call the configuration
	functions for the top level groups as well as for the sub group
	in question (making it possible to pass configuration data all
	the way from <c>init_per_suite</c> down to the test cases in the
	sub group).</p>
	<p>The test specification utilizes the same mechanism for specifying
	test case groups by means of names and paths, as explained in the
	<seealso marker="run_test_chapter#group_execution">Group Execution</seealso>
	section above, with the addition of the <c>GroupSpec</c> element
	described next.</p>
	<p>The <c>GroupSpec</c> element makes it possible to specify
	group execution properties that will override those in the
	group definition (i.e. in <c>groups/0</c>). Execution properties for
	sub-groups may be overridden as well. This feature makes it possible to
	change properties of groups at the time of execution,
	without even having to edit the test suite. The very same
	feature is available for <c>group</c> elements in the <c>Suite:all/0</c>
	list. Therefore, more detailed documentation, and examples, can be
	found in the <seealso marker="write_test_chapter#test_case_groups">
	Test case groups</seealso> chapter.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
	<title>Test specification syntax</title>

	<p>Below is the test specification syntax. Test specifications can
	be used to run tests both in a single test host environment and
	in a distributed Common Test environment (Large Scale
	Testing). The node parameters in the <c>init</c> term are only
	relevant in the latter (see the
	<seealso marker="ct_master_chapter#test_specifications">Large
	Scale Testing</seealso> chapter for information). For more information
	about the various terms, please see the corresponding sections in the
	User's Guide, such as e.g. the
	<seealso marker="run_test_chapter#ct_run"><c>ct_run</c>
	program</seealso> for an overview of available start flags
	(since most flags have a corresponding configuration term), and
	more detailed explanation of e.g.
	<seealso marker="write_test_chapter#logging">Logging</seealso>

       <section>	
	<p>The difference between the <c>config</c> terms above, is that with
	<c>ConfigDir</c>, <c>ConfigBaseNames</c> is a list of base names,
	i.e. without directory paths. <c>ConfigFiles</c> must be full names,
	including paths. E.g, these two terms have the same meaning:</p>
	<pre>
	  {config, ["/home/testuser/tests/config/nodeA.cfg",
	            "/home/testuser/tests/config/nodeB.cfg"]}.
	  
	  {config, "/home/testuser/tests/config", ["nodeA.cfg","nodeB.cfg"]}.</pre>

	  <note><p>Any relative paths specified in the test specification, will be
	  relative to the directory which contains the test specification file, if
	  <c>ct_run -spec TestSpecFile ...</c> or
	  <c>ct:run:test([{spec,TestSpecFile},...])</c>
	  executes the test. The path will be relative to the top level log directory, if
	  <c>ct:run:testspec(TestSpec)</c> executes the test.</p></note>	  
	</section>

	<section>
	  <title>Constants</title>

	  <p>The <c>define</c> term introduces a constant, which is used to
	  replace the name <c>Constant</c> with <c>Value</c>, wherever it's found in
	  the test specification. This replacement happens during an initial iteration
	  through the test specification. Constants may be used anywhere in the test
	  specification, e.g. in arbitrary lists and tuples, and even in strings
	  and inside the value part of other constant definitions! A constant can
	  also be part of a node name, but that is the only place where a constant
	  can be part of an atom.</p>
	  
	  <note><p>For the sake of readability, the name of the constant must always
	  begin with an upper case letter, or a <c>$</c>, <c>?</c>, or <c>_</c>.
	  This also means that it must always be single quoted (obviously, since
	  the constant name is actually an atom, not text).</p></note>
	  
	  <p>The main benefit of constants is that they can be used to reduce the size
	  (and avoid repetition) of long strings, such as file paths. Compare these
	  terms:</p>
	  
	  <pre>
	    %% 1a. no constant
	    {config, "/home/testuser/tests/config", ["nodeA.cfg","nodeB.cfg"]}.
	    {suites, "/home/testuser/tests/suites", all}.
	    
	    %% 1b. with constant
	    {define, 'TESTDIR', "/home/testuser/tests"}.
	    {config, "'TESTDIR'/config", ["nodeA.cfg","nodeB.cfg"]}.
	    {suites, "'TESTDIR'/suites", all}.
	    
	    %% 2a. no constants
	    {config, [testnode@host1, testnode@host2], "../config", ["nodeA.cfg","nodeB.cfg"]}.
	    {suites, [testnode@host1, testnode@host2], "../suites", [x_SUITE, y_SUITE]}.
	    
	    %% 2b. with constants
	    {define, 'NODE', testnode}.
	    {define, 'NODES', ['NODE'@host1, 'NODE'@host2]}.
	    {config, 'NODES', "../config", ["nodeA.cfg","nodeB.cfg"]}.
	    {suites, 'NODES', "../suites", [x_SUITE, y_SUITE]}.</pre>

	    <p>Constants make the test specification term <c>alias</c>, in previous
	    versions of Common Test, redundant. This term has been deprecated but will
	    remain supported in upcoming Common Test releases. Replacing <c>alias</c>
	    terms with <c>define</c> is strongly recommended though! Here's an example
	    of such a replacement:</p>
	    
	    <pre>
	      %% using the old alias term
	      {config, "/home/testuser/tests/config/nodeA.cfg"}.
	      {alias, suite_dir, "/home/testuser/tests/suites"}.
	      {groups, suite_dir, x_SUITE, group1}.
	      
	      %% replacing with constants
	      {define, 'TestDir', "/home/testuser/tests"}.
	      {define, 'CfgDir', "'TestDir'/config"}.
	      {define, 'SuiteDir', "'TestDir'/suites"}.
	      {config, 'CfgDir', "nodeA.cfg"}.
	      {groups, 'SuiteDir', x_SUITE, group1}.</pre>
	      
	      <p>Actually, constants could well replace the <c>node</c> term too, but
	      this still has declarative value, mainly when used in combination
	      with <c>NodeRefs == all_nodes</c> (see types above).</p>
	</section>

	<section>
	  <title>Example</title>
	  
	  <p>Here follows a simple test specification example:</p>
	  <pre>
	    {define, 'Top', "/home/test"}.
	    {define, 'T1', "'Top'/t1"}.
	    {define, 'T2', "'Top'/t2"}.
	    {define, 'T3', "'Top'/t3"}.
	    {define, 'CfgFile', "config.cfg"}.
	    
	    {logdir, "'Top'/logs"}.
	    
	    {config, ["'T1'/'CfgFile'", "'T2'/'CfgFile'", "'T3'/'CfgFile'"]}.
	    
	    {suites, 'T1', all}.
	    {skip_suites, 'T1', [t1B_SUITE,t1D_SUITE], "Not implemented"}.
	    {skip_cases, 'T1', t1A_SUITE, [test3,test4], "Irrelevant"}.
	    {skip_cases, 'T1', t1C_SUITE, [test1], "Ignore"}.
	    
	    {suites, 'T2', [t2B_SUITE,t2C_SUITE]}.
	    {cases, 'T2', t2A_SUITE, [test4,test1,test7]}.
	    
	    {skip_suites, 'T3', all, "Not implemented"}.</pre>
	  
	  <p>The example specifies the following:</p>
	  <list>
	    <item>The specified logdir directory will be used for storing 
	    the HTML log files (in subdirectories tagged with node name, 
	    date and time).</item>
	    <item>The variables in the specified test system config files will be 
	    imported for the test.</item>
	    <item>The first test to run includes all suites for system t1. Excluded from
	    the test are however the t1B and t1D suites. Also test cases test3 and
	    test4 in t1A as well as the test1 case in t1C are excluded from
	    the test.</item>
	    <item>Secondly, the test for system t2 should run. The included suites are
	    t2B and t2C. Included are also test cases test4, test1 and test7 in suite
	    t2A. Note that the test cases will be executed in the specified order.</item>
	    <item>Lastly, all suites for systems t3 are to be completely skipped and this
	    should be explicitly noted in the log files.</item>
	  </list>
	</section>

	<section>
	  <title>The init term</title>
	  <p>With the <c>init</c> term it's possible to specify initialization options
	  for nodes defined in the test specification. Currently, there are options
	  to start the node and/or to evaluate any function on the node.
	  See the <seealso marker="ct_master_chapter#ct_slave">Automatic startup of
	  the test target nodes</seealso> chapter for details.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
	  <title>User specific terms</title>
	  <p>It is possible for the user to provide a test specification that
	  includes (for Common Test) unrecognizable terms. If this is desired,
	  the <c>-allow_user_terms</c> flag should be used when starting tests with
	  <c>ct_run</c>. This forces Common Test to ignore unrecognizable terms.
	  Note that in this mode, Common Test is not able to check the specification 
	  for errors as efficiently as if the scanner runs in default mode. 
	  If <seealso marker="ct#run_test-1"><c>ct:run_test/1</c></seealso> is used
	  for starting the tests, the relaxed scanner
	  mode is enabled by means of the tuple: <c>{allow_user_terms,true}</c></p>
	</section>
	<section>
	  <title>Reading test specification terms</title>
	  <p>It's possible to look up terms in the current test specification
	  (i.e. the spec that's been used to configure and run the current test).
	  The function <c>get_testspec_terms()</c> returns a list of all test spec
	  terms (both config- and test terms) and <c>get_testspec_terms(Tags)</c>
	  returns the term (or a list of terms) matching the tag (or tags) in
	  <c>Tags</c>.</p>
	  <p>For example, in the test specification:</p>
	  <pre>
	    ...
	    {label, my_server_smoke_test}.
	    {config, "../../my_server_setup.cfg"}.
	    {config, "../../my_server_interface.cfg"}.
	    ...</pre>	    
	  <p>And in e.g. a test suite or a CT hook function:</p>
	  <pre>
	    ...
	    [{label,[{_Node,TestType}]}, {config,CfgFiles}] =
                ct:get_testspec_terms([label,config]),

            [verify_my_server_cfg(TestType, CfgFile) || {Node,CfgFile} &lt;- CfgFiles,
                                                        Node == node()];
	    ...</pre>

    <title>Running tests from the Web based GUI</title>
    
    <p>The web based GUI, VTS, is started with the
      <seealso marker="run_test_chapter#ct_run"><c>ct_run</c></seealso>
      program. From the GUI you can load config files, and select
      directories, suites and cases to run. You can also state the
      config files, directories, suites and cases on the command line
      when starting the web based GUI.
    </p>
    
    <list>
      <item><c>ct_run -vts</c></item>
      <item><c><![CDATA[ct_run -vts -config <configfilename>]]></c></item>
      <item><c><![CDATA[ct_run -vts -config <configfilename> -suite <suitewithfullpath>
	      -case <casename>]]></c></item>
    </list>
    
    <p>From the GUI you can run tests and view the result and the logs.
    </p>
    
    <p>Note that <c>ct_run -vts</c> will try to open the Common Test start
      page in an existing web browser window or start the browser if it is
      not running. Which browser should be started may be specified with
      the browser start command option:</p>
      <p><c><![CDATA[ct_run -vts -browser <browser_start_cmd>]]></c></p>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <p><c><![CDATA[$ ct_run -vts -browser 'firefox&']]></c></p>
      <p>Note that the browser must run as a separate OS process or VTS will hang!</p>
      <p>If no specific browser start command is specified, Firefox will
        be the default browser on Unix platforms and Internet Explorer on Windows.
	If Common Test fails to start a browser automatically, or <c>'none'</c> is
	specified as the value for -browser (i.e. <c>-browser none</c>), start your
	favourite browser manually and type in the URL that Common Test
	displays in the shell.</p>    
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <marker id="log_files"></marker>
    <title>Log files</title>
    
    <p>As the execution of the test suites proceed, events are logged in
      four different ways:</p>
      
      <list>
	<item>Text to the operator's console.</item>
	<item>Suite related information is sent to the major log file.</item>
	<item>Case related information is sent to the minor log file.</item>
	<item>The HTML overview log file gets updated with test results.</item>
	<item>A link to all runs executed from a certain directory is written in
	  the log named "all_runs.html" and direct links to all tests (the
	  latest results) are written to the top level "index.html".</item>
      </list>
      
      <p>Typically the operator, who may run hundreds or thousands of
	test cases, doesn't want to fill the console with details
	about, or printouts from, the specific test cases. By default, the 
	operator will only see:</p>
      
      <list>
	<item>A confirmation that the test has started and information about how 
	  many test cases will be executed totally.</item>
	<item>A small note about each failed test case.</item>
	<item>A summary of all the run test cases.</item>
	<item>A confirmation that the test run is complete.</item>
	<item>Some special information like error reports and progress
	  reports, printouts written with erlang:display/1, or io:format/3
	  specifically addressed to a receiver other than <c>standard_io</c>
	  (e.g. the default group leader process 'user').</item>
      </list>

      <p>If/when the operator wants to dig deeper into the general results, or
        the result of a specific test case, he should do so by
	following the links in the HTML presentation and take a look in the
	major or minor log files. The "all_runs.html" page is a practical
	starting point usually. It's located in <c>logdir</c> and contains
	a link to each test run including a quick overview (date and time,
	node name, number of tests, test names and test result totals).</p>
	
      <p>An "index.html" page is written for each test run (i.e. stored in
	the "ct_run" directory tagged with node name, date and time). This
	file gives a short overview of all individual tests performed in the 
	same test run. The test names follow this convention:</p>
      <list>
	<item><em>TopLevelDir.TestDir</em> (all suites in TestDir executed)</item>
	<item><em>TopLevelDir.TestDir:suites</em> (specific suites were executed)</item>
	<item><em>TopLevelDir.TestDir.Suite</em> (all cases in Suite executed)</item>
	<item><em>TopLevelDir.TestDir.Suite:cases</em> (specific test cases were executed)</item>
	<item><em>TopLevelDir.TestDir.Suite.Case</em> (only Case was executed)</item>
      </list>
      
      <p>On the test run index page there is a link to the Common Test
        Framework Log file in which information about imported
        configuration data and general test progress is written. This
        log file is useful to get snapshot information about the test
        run during execution. It can also be very helpful when
        analyzing test results or debugging test suites.</p>

      <p>On the test run index page it is noted if a test has missing
        suites (i.e. suites that Common Test has failed to
        compile). Names of the missing suites can be found in the
        Common Test Framework Log file.</p>

      <p>The major log file shows a detailed report of the test run. It
        includes test suite and test case names, execution time, the 
	exact reason for failures etc. The information is available in both
	a file with textual and with HTML representation. The HTML file shows a 
	summary which gives a good overview of the test run. It also has links 
	to each individual test case log file for quick viewing with an HTML 
	browser.</p>
      
      <p>The minor log files contain full details of every single test
	case, each one in a separate file. This way, it should be
	straightforward	to compare the latest results to that of previous
	test runs, even if the set of test cases changes. If SASL is running,
	its logs will also be printed to the current minor log file by the
	<seealso marker="common_test:ct_hooks_chapter#builtin_cths">
	  cth_log_redirect built-in hook</seealso>.
      </p>

      <p>The full name of the minor log file (i.e. the name of the file
	including the absolute directory path) can be read during execution
	of the test case. It comes as value in the tuple
	<c>{tc_logfile,LogFileName}</c> in the <c>Config</c> list (which means it
	can also be read by a pre- or post Common Test hook function). Also,
	at the start of a test case, this data is sent with an event
	to any installed event handler.	Please see the
	<seealso marker="event_handler_chapter#event_handling">Event Handling</seealso>
	chapter for details.
      </p>
      
      <p>Which information goes where is user configurable via the
	test server controller. Three threshold values determine what
	comes out on screen, and in the major or minor log files. See
	the OTP Test Server manual for information. The	contents that 
	goes to the HTML log file is fixed however and cannot be altered.</p>

      <p>The log files are written continously during a test run and links are
	always created initially when a test starts. This makes it possible
	to follow test progress simply by refreshing pages in the HTML browser.
	Statistics totals are not presented until a test is complete however.</p>

	<section>
	  <marker id="logopts"></marker>
	  <title>Log options</title>
	  <p>With the <c>logopts</c> start flag, it's possible to specify
	  options that modify some aspects of the logging behaviour.
	  Currently, the following options are available:</p>
	  <list>
	    <item><c>no_src</c></item>
	    <item><c>no_nl</c></item>
	  </list>
	  <p>With <c>no_src</c>, the html version of the test suite source
	  code will not be generated during the test run (and consequently
	  not be available in the log file system).</p>
	  <p>With <c>no_nl</c>, Common Test will not add a newline character
	  (\n) to the end of an output string that it receives from a call to e.g.
	  <c>io:format/2</c>, and which it prints to the test case log.</p>
	  <p>For example, if a test is started with:</p>
	  <p><c>$ ct_run -suite my_SUITE -logopts no_src</c></p>
	  <p>then printouts during the test made by successive calls to <c>io:format("x")</c>,
	  will appear in the test case log as:</p>
	  <p><c>xxx</c></p>
	  <p>instead of each <c>x</c> printed on a new line, which is the default behaviour.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
	  <marker id="table_sorting"></marker>
	  <title>Sorting HTML table columns</title>
	  <p>By clicking the name in the column header of any table (e.g. "Ok", "Case", "Time", etc),
	    the table rows are sorted in whatever order makes sense for the type of value (e.g.
	    numerical for "Ok" or "Time", and alphabetical for "Case"). The sorting is performed
	    by means of JavaScript code, automatically inserted into the HTML log files. Common Test
	    uses the <url href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</url> library and the
	    <url href="http://tablesorter.com">tablesorter</url> plugin, with customized sorting
	    functions, for this implementation.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
	  <title>The Unexpected I/O Log</title>
	  <p>On the test suites overview page you find a link to the Unexpected I/O Log.
	  In this log, Common Test saves printouts made with
	  <c>ct:log/2</c> and <c>ct:pal/2</c>, as well as captured system error- and
	  progress reports, that cannot be associated with particular test cases and
	  therefore cannot be written to individual test case log files. This happens e.g.
	  if a log printout is made from an external process (not a test case process),
	  or if an error- or progress report comes in, during a short interval while Common
	  Test is not executing a test case or configuration function, <em>or</em> while
	  Common Test is currently executing a parallell test case group.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
	  <marker id="pre_post_test_io_log"></marker>
	  <title>The Pre- and Post Test I/O Log</title>
	  <p>On the Common Test Framework Log page you find links to the so called
	  Pre- and Post Test I/O Log. In this log, Common Test saves printouts made with
	  <c>ct:log/2</c> and <c>ct:pal/2</c>, as well as captured system error-
	  and progress reports, that take place before - and after - the actual test run.
	  Examples of this are printouts from a CT hook init- or terminate function, or
	  progress reports generated when an OTP application is started from a CT hook
	  init function. Another example is an error report generated due to
	  a failure when an external application is stopped from a CT hook terminate function.
	  All information in these examples ends up in the Pre- and Post Test I/O Log.
	  For more information on how to synchronize test runs with external user
	  applications, please see the
	  <seealso marker="ct_hooks_chapter#synchronizing">Synchronizing</seealso>
	  section in the Common Test Hooks chapter.</p>
	  <p>Note that logging to file with <c>ct:log/2</c> or <c>ct:pal/2</c>
	  only works when Common Test is running. Printouts with <c>ct:pal/2</c>
	  are however always displayed on screen.</p>
	</section>
      </section>
  
      <section>
	<marker id="html_stylesheet"></marker>
	<title>HTML Style Sheets</title>
	<p>Common Test uses an HTML Style Sheet (CSS file) to control the look of
	  the HTML log files generated during test runs. If, for some reason, the
	  log files are not displayed correctly in the browser of your
	  choice, or you prefer a more primitive ("pre Common Test v1.6") look
	  of the logs, use the start flag/option:</p>
	<pre>basic_html</pre>
	<p>This disables the use of Style Sheets, as well as JavaScripts (see
	  table sorting above).</p>
	  
	<p>Common Test includes an <em>optional</em> feature to allow
	  user HTML style sheets for customizing printouts. The
	  functions in <c>ct</c> that print to a test case HTML log
	  file (<c>log/3</c> and <c>pal/3</c>) accept <c>Category</c>
	  as first argument. With this argument it's possible to
	  specify a category that can be mapped to a selector in a CSS
	  definition. This is useful especially for coloring text
	  differently depending on the type of (or reason for) the
	  printout. Say you want one color for test system
	  configuration information, a different one for test system
	  state information and finally one for errors detected by the
	  test case functions. The corresponding style sheet may
	  look like this:</p>

	<pre>
	  div.sys_config  { background:blue; color:white }
	  div.sys_state   { background:yellow; color:black }
	  div.error       { background:red; color:white }</pre>

	<p>To install the CSS file (Common Test inlines the definition in the 
	  HTML code), the name may be provided when executing <c>ct_run</c>.
	  Example:</p>

	<pre>
	  $ ct_run -dir $TEST/prog -stylesheet $TEST/styles/test_categories.css</pre>

	  <p>Categories in a CSS file installed with the <c>-stylesheet</c> flag
	    are on a global test level in the sense that they can be used in any 
	    suite which is part of the test run.</p>

	  <p>It is also possible to install style sheets on a per suite and
	  per test case basis. Example:</p>

	<pre>
	  -module(my_SUITE).
	  ...
	  suite() -> [..., {stylesheet,"suite_categories.css"}, ...].
	  ...
	  my_testcase(_) ->

	      ct:log(sys_config, "Test node version: ~p", [VersionInfo]),
	      ...
	      ct:log(sys_state, "Connections: ~p", [ConnectionInfo]),
	      ...
	      ct:pal(error, "Error ~p detected! Info: ~p", [SomeFault,ErrorInfo]),
	      ct:fail(SomeFault).</pre>

	<p>If the style sheet is installed as in this example, the categories are 
	  private to the suite in question. They can be used by all test cases in the 
	  suite, but can not be used by other suites. A suite private style sheet, 
	  if specified, will be used in favour of a global style sheet (one specified 
	  with the <c>-stylesheet</c> flag). A stylesheet tuple (as returned by <c>suite/0</c> 
	  above) can also be returned from a test case info function. In this case the 
	  categories specified in the style sheet can only be used in that particular 
	  test case. A test case private style sheet is used in favour of a suite or 
	  global level style sheet.
	</p>

	<p>In a tuple <c>{stylesheet,CSSFile}</c>, if <c>CSSFile</c> is specified
	  with a path, e.g. <c>"$TEST/styles/categories.css"</c>, this full
	  name will be used to locate the file. If only the file name is specified
	  however, e.g. "categories.css", then the CSS file is assumed to be located
	  in the data directory, <c>data_dir</c>, of the suite. The latter usage is
	  recommended since it is portable compared to hard coding path names in the 
	  suite!</p>

	<p>The <c>Category</c> argument in the example above may have the
	  value (atom) <c>sys_config</c> (white on blue), <c>sys_state</c>
	  (black on yellow) or <c>error</c> (white on red).</p>

    <title>Repeating tests</title>    
    <p>You can order Common Test to repeat the tests you specify. You can choose
       to repeat tests a certain number of times, repeat tests for a specific period of time, 
       or repeat tests until a particular stop time is reached. If repetition is controlled by
       means of time, it is also possible to specify what action Common Test should 
       take upon timeout. Either Common Test performs all tests in the current run before stopping, 
       or it stops as soon as the current test job is finished. Repetition can be activated by
       means of <c>ct_run</c> start flags, or tuples in the <c>ct:run:test/1</c>
       option list argument. The flags (options in parenthesis) are:</p>
       <list>
       <item><c>-repeat N ({repeat,N})</c>, where <c>N</c> is a positive integer.</item>
       <item><c>-duration DurTime ({duration,DurTime})</c>, where <c>DurTime</c> is the duration, see below.</item>
       <item><c>-until StopTime ({until,StopTime})</c>, where <c>StopTime</c> is finish time, see below.</item>
       <item><c>-force_stop ({force_stop,true})</c></item>
       <item><c>-force_stop skip_rest ({force_stop,skip_rest})</c></item>
       </list>
       <p>The duration time, <c>DurTime</c>, is specified as <c>HHMMSS</c>. Example: 
          <c>-duration 012030</c> or <c>{duration,"012030"}</c>, means the tests will 
	  be executed and (if time allows) repeated, until timeout occurs after 1 h, 20 min 
	  and 30 secs. 
	  <c>StopTime</c> can be specified as <c>HHMMSS</c> and is then interpreted as a time today 
	  (or possibly tomorrow). <c>StopTime</c> can also be specified as <c>YYMoMoDDHHMMSS</c>. 
	  Example: <c>-until 071001120000</c> or <c>{until,"071001120000"}</c>, which means the tests
	  will be executed and (if time allows) repeated, until 12 o'clock on the 1st of Oct 2007.</p>

       <p>When timeout occurs, Common Test will never abort the ongoing test case, since
          this might leave the system under test in an undefined, and possibly bad, state.
	  Instead Common Test will by default finish the current test
	  run before stopping. If the <c>force_stop</c> flag is
	  given, Common Test will stop as soon as the current test job
	  is finished, and if the <c>force_stop</c> flag is given with
	  <c>skip_rest</c> Common Test will only complete the current
	  test case and skip the rest of the tests in the test job.
	  Note that since Common Test always finishes off at least the
	  current test case,
	  the time specified with <c>duration</c> or <c>until</c> is never definitive!</p>

       <p>Log files from every single repeated test run is saved in normal Common Test fashion (see above). 
          Common Test may later support an optional feature to only store the last (and possibly 
	  the first) set of logs of repeated test runs, but for now the user must be careful not 
	  to run out of disk space if tests are repeated during long periods of time.</p>

       <p>Note that for each test run that is part of a repeated session, information about the
          particular test run is printed in the Common Test Framework Log. There you can read
	  the repetition number, remaining time, etc.</p>

       <p>Example 1:</p>
       <pre>
          $ ct_run -dir $TEST_ROOT/to1 $TEST_ROOT/to2 -duration 001000 -force_stop</pre>
       <p>Here the suites in test directory to1, followed by the suites in to2, will be executed 
          in one test run. A timeout event will occur after 10 minutes. As long as there is time 
	  left, Common Test will repeat the test run (i.e. starting over with the to1 test). 
	  When the timeout occurs, Common Test will stop as soon as the current job is finished
	  (because of the <c>force_stop</c> flag). As a result, the specified test run might be 
	  aborted after the to1 test and before the to2 test.</p>

       <p>Example 2:</p>
       <pre>
          $ ct_run -dir $TEST_ROOT/to1 $TEST_ROOT/to2 -duration 001000 -forces_stop skip_rest</pre>
       <p>Here the same test run as in Example 1, but with the
       <c>force_stop</c> flag set to <c>skip_rest</c>. If the timeout
       occurs while executing tests in directory to1, the rest of the
       test cases in to1 will be skipped and then the test will be
       aborted without running the tests in to2 another time. If the
       timeout occurs while executing tests in directory to2, then the
       rest of the test cases in to2 will be skipped and then the test
       will be aborted.</p>

       <p>Example 3:</p>
       <pre>
          $ date
	  Fri Sep 28 15:00:00 MEST 2007

          $ ct_run -dir $TEST_ROOT/to1 $TEST_ROOT/to2 -until 160000</pre>
       <p>Here the same test run as in the example above will be executed (and possibly repeated). 
          In this example, however, the timeout will occur after 1 hour and when that happens,
	  Common Test will finish the entire test run before stopping (i.e. the to1 and to2 test
	  will always both be executed in the same test run).</p>
       
       <p>Example 4:</p>
       <pre>
          $ ct_run -dir $TEST_ROOT/to1 $TEST_ROOT/to2 -repeat 5</pre>
       <p>Here the test run, including both the to1 and the to2 test, will be repeated 5 times.</p>

       <note><p>This feature should not be confused with the <c>repeat</c> property of a test
          case group. The options described here are used to repeat execution of entire test runs,
	  while the <c>repeat</c> property of a test case group makes it possible to repeat
	  execution of sets of test cases within a suite. For more information about the latter,
	  see the <seealso marker="write_test_chapter#test_case_groups">Writing Test Suites</seealso>
	  chapter.</p></note>

      <title>Silent Connections</title>
      <p>The protocol handling processes in Common Test, implemented by ct_telnet,
      ct_ssh, ct_ftp etc, do verbose printing to the test case logs. This can be switched off
      by means of the <c>-silent_connections</c> flag:</p>
      
      <pre>
	ct_run -silent_connections [conn_types]
      </pre>
      
      <p>where <c>conn_types</c> specifies <c>ssh, telnet, ftp, rpc</c> and/or <c>snmp</c>.</p>
      
      <p>Example:</p>
      
      <pre>
	ct_run ... -silent_connections ssh telnet</pre>
      <p>switches off logging for ssh and telnet connections.</p>
      
      <pre>
	ct_run ... -silent_connections</pre>
      <p>switches off logging for all connection types.</p>
      
      
      <p>Fatal communication error and reconnection attempts will always be printed even 
      if logging has been suppressed for the connection type in question. However, operations
      such as sending and receiving data will be performed silently.</p>
      
      <p>It is possible to also specify <c>silent_connections</c> in a test suite. This is
	accomplished by returning a tuple, <c>{silent_connections,ConnTypes}</c>, in the
	<c>suite/0</c> or test case info list. If <c>ConnTypes</c> is a list of atoms 
	(<c>ssh, telnet, ftp, rpc</c> and/or <c>snmp</c>), output for any corresponding connections 
	will be suppressed. Full logging is per default enabled for any connection of type not 
	specified in <c>ConnTypes</c>. Hence, if <c>ConnTypes</c> is the empty list, logging 
	is enabled for all connections.</p>
      
	<p>Example:</p>
      
      <pre>
	
	-module(my_SUITE).

	suite() -> [..., {silent_connections,[telnet,ssh]}, ...].

	...

	my_testcase1() ->
	    [{silent_connections,[ssh]}].

	my_testcase1(_) ->
	    ...

	my_testcase2(_) ->
	    ...
      </pre>
      
      <p>In this example, <c>suite/0</c> tells Common Test to suppress
	printouts from telnet and ssh connections. This is valid for
	all test cases. However, <c>my_testcase1/0</c> specifies that
	for this test case, only ssh should be silent. The result is
	that <c>my_testcase1</c> will get telnet info (if any) printed
	in the log, but not ssh info. <c>my_testcase2</c> will get no
	info from either connection printed.</p>
      
	<p><c>silent_connections</c> may also be specified with a term
	in a test specification
	(see <seealso marker="run_test_chapter#test_specifications">Test
	Specifications</seealso>). Connections provided with the
	<c>silent_connections</c> start	flag/option, will be merged with
	any connections listed in the test specification.</p>

	<p>The <c>silent_connections</c> start flag/option and test
	specification term, overrides any settings made by the info functions
	inside the test suite.</p>
      
      <note><p>Note that in the current Common Test version, the
	<c>silent_connections</c> feature only works for telnet
	and ssh connections! Support for other connection types will be added
	in future Common Test versions.</p></note>
