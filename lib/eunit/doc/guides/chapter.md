# EUnit - a Lightweight Unit Testing Framework for Erlang

EUnit is a unit testing framework for Erlang. It is very powerful and flexible,
is easy to use, and has small syntactical overhead.

- [Unit testing](chapter.md#Unit_testing)
- [Terminology](chapter.md#terminology)
- [Getting started](chapter.md#Getting_started)
- [EUnit macros](chapter.md#EUnit_macros)
- [EUnit test representation](chapter.md#EUnit_test_representation)

EUnit builds on ideas from the family of unit testing frameworks for Object
Oriented languages that originated with JUnit by Beck and Gamma (and Beck's
previous framework SUnit for Smalltalk). However, EUnit uses techniques more
adapted to functional and concurrent programming, and is typically less verbose
than its relatives.

Although EUnit uses many preprocessor macros, they have been designed to be as
nonintrusive as possible, and should not cause conflicts with existing code.
Adding EUnit tests to a module should thus not normally require changing
existing code. Furthermore, tests that only exercise the exported functions of a
module can always be placed in a completely separate module, avoiding any
conflicts entirely.

## Unit testing

Unit Testing is testing of individual program "units" in relative isolation.
There is no particular size requirement: a unit can be a function, a module, a
process, or even a whole application, but the most typical testing units are
individual functions or modules. In order to test a unit, you specify a set of
individual tests, set up the smallest necessary environment for being able to
run those tests (often, you don't need to do any setup at all), you run the
tests and collect the results, and finally you do any necessary cleanup so that
the test can be run again later. A Unit Testing Framework tries to help you in
each stage of this process, so that it is easy to write tests, easy to run them,
and easy to see which tests failed (so you can fix the bugs).

[](){: #Advantages_of_unit_testing }

### Advantages of unit testing

- **Reduces the risks of changing the program** - Most programs will be modified
  during their lifetime: bugs will be fixed, features will be added,
  optimizations may become necessary, or the code will need to be refactored or
  cleaned up in other ways to make it easier to work with. But every change to a
  working program is a risk of introducing new bugs - or reintroducing bugs that
  had previously been fixed. Having a set of unit tests that you can run with
  very little effort makes it easy to know that the code still works as it
  should (this use is called _regression testing_; see
  [Terminology](chapter.md#terminology)). This goes a long way to reduce the
  resistance to changing and refactoring code.

- **Helps guide and speed up the development process** - By focusing on getting
  the code to pass the tests, the programmer can become more productive, not
  overspecify or get lost in premature optimizations, and create code that is
  correct from the very beginning (so-called _test-driven development_; see
  [Terminology](chapter.md#terminology)).

- **Helps separate interface from implementation** - When writing tests, the
  programmer may discover dependencies (in order to get the tests to run) that
  ought not to be there, and which need to be abstracted away to get a cleaner
  design. This helps eliminate bad dependencies before they spread throughout
  the code.

- **Makes component integration easier** - By testing in a bottom-up fashion,
  beginning with the smallest program units and creating a confidence in that
  they work as they should, it becomes easier to test that a higher-level
  component, consisting of several such units, also behaves according to
  specification (known as _integration testing_; see
  [Terminology](chapter.md#terminology)).

- **Is self-documenting** - The tests can be read as documentation, typically
  showing both examples of correct and incorrect usage, along with the expected
  consequences.

## Terminology

- **Unit testing** - Testing that a program unit behaves as it is supposed to do
  (in itself), according to its specifications. Unit tests have an important
  function as regression tests, when the program later is modified for some
  reason, since they check that the program still behaves according to
  specification.

- **Regression testing** - Running a set of tests after making changes to a
  program, to check that the program behaves as it did before the changes
  (except, of course, for any intentional changes in behaviour). Unit tests are
  important as regression tests, but regression testing can involve more than
  just unit testing, and may also test behaviour that might not be part of the
  normal specification (such as bug-for-bug-compatibility).

- **Integration testing** - Testing that a number of individually developed
  program units (assumed to already have been separately unit tested) work
  together as expected. Depending on the system being developed, integration
  testing may be as simple as "just another level of unit testing", but might
  also involve other kinds of tests (compare _system testing_).

- **System testing** - Testing that a complete system behaves according to its
  specification. Specifically, system testing should not require knowing any
  details about the implementation. It typically involves testing many different
  aspects of the system behaviour apart from the basic functionality, such as
  performance, usability, and reliability.

- **Test-driven development** - A program development technique where you
  continuously write tests _before_ you implement the code that is supposed to
  pass those tests. This can help you focus on solving the right problems, and
  not make a more complicated implementation than necessary, by letting the unit
  tests determine when a program is "done": if it fulfils its specifications,
  there is no need to keep adding functionality.

- **Mock object** - Sometimes, testing some unit `A` (e.g., a function) requires
  that it collaborates somehow with some other unit `B` (perhaps being passed as
  an argument, or by reference) - but `B` has not been implemented yet. A "mock
  object" - an object which, for the purposes of testing `A`, looks and behaves
  like a real `B` \- might then be used instead. (This is of course only useful
  if it would be significantly more work to implement a real `B` than to create
  a mock object.)

- **Test case** - A single, well-defined test, that somehow can be uniquely
  identified. When executed, the test case either _passes_ or _fails_; the test
  report should identify exactly which test cases failed.

- **Test suite** - A collection of test cases, generally with a specific, common
  target for testing, such as a single function, module, or subsystem. A test
  suite may also be recursively composed by smaller test suites.

[](){: #Including_the_EUnit_header_file }

### Including the EUnit header file

The simplest way to use EUnit in an Erlang module is to add the following line
at the beginning of the module (after the `-module` declaration, but before any
function definitions):

```text
   -include_lib("eunit/include/eunit.hrl").
```

This will have the following effect:

- Creates an exported function `test()` (unless testing is turned off, and the
  module does not already contain a test() function), that can be used to run
  all the unit tests defined in the module
- Causes all functions whose names match `..._test()` or `..._test_()` to be
  automatically exported from the module (unless testing is turned off, or the
  `EUNIT_NOAUTO` macro is defined)
- Makes all the preprocessor macros of EUnit available, to help writing tests

_Note:_ For `-include_lib(...)` to work, the Erlang module search path _must_
contain a directory whose name ends in `eunit/ebin` (pointing to the `ebin`
subdirectory of the EUnit installation directory). If EUnit is installed as
`lib/eunit` under your Erlang/OTP system directory, its `ebin` subdirectory will
be automatically added to the search path when Erlang starts. Otherwise, you
need to add the directory explicitly, by passing a `-pa` flag to the `erl` or
`erlc` command. For example, a Makefile could contain the following action for
compiling `.erl` files:

```text
   erlc -pa "path/to/eunit/ebin" $(ERL_COMPILE_FLAGS) -o$(EBIN) $<
```

or if you want Eunit to always be available when you run Erlang interactively,
you can add a line like the following to your `$HOME/.erlang` file:

```text
   code:add_path("/path/to/eunit/ebin").
```

[](){: #Writing_simple_test_functions }

### Writing simple test functions

The EUnit framework makes it extremely easy to write unit tests in Erlang. There
are a few different ways of writing them, though, so we start with the simplest:

A function with a name ending in `..._test()` is recognized by EUnit as a simple
test function - it takes no arguments, and its execution either succeeds
(returning some arbitrary value that EUnit will throw away), or fails by
throwing an exception of some kind (or by not terminating, in which case it will
be aborted after a while).

An example of a simple test function could be the following:

```text
   reverse_test() -> lists:reverse([1,2,3]).
```

This just tests that the function `lists:reverse(List)` does not crash when
`List` is `[1,2,3]`. It is not a great test, but many people write simple
functions like this one to test the basic functionality of their code, and those
tests can be used directly by EUnit, without changes, as long as their function
names match.

_Use exceptions to signal failure_{: #Use_exceptions_to_signal_failure } To
write more interesting tests, we need to make them crash (throw an exception)
when they don't get the result they expect. A simple way of doing this is to use
pattern matching with `=`, as in the following examples:

```text
   reverse_nil_test() -> [] = lists:reverse([]).
   reverse_one_test() -> [1] = lists:reverse([1]).
   reverse_two_test() -> [2,1] = lists:reverse([1,2]).
```

If there was some bug in `lists:reverse/1` that made it return something other
than `[2,1]` when it got `[1,2]` as input, then the last test above would throw
a `badmatch` error. The first two (we assume they do not get a `badmatch`) would
simply return `[]` and `[1]`, respectively, so both succeed. (Note that EUnit is
not psychic: if you write a test that returns a value, even if it is the wrong
value, EUnit will consider it a success. You must make sure that the test is
written so that it causes a crash if the result is not what it should be.)

_Using assert macros_{: #Using_assert_macros } If you want to use Boolean
operators for your tests, the `assert` macro comes in handy (see
[EUnit macros](chapter.md#EUnit_macros) for details):

```text
   length_test() -> ?assert(length([1,2,3]) =:= 3).
```

The `?assert(Expression)` macro will evaluate `Expression`, and if that does not
evaluate to `true`, it will throw an exception; otherwise it just returns `ok`.
In the above example, the test will thus fail if the call to `length` does not
return 3.

[](){: #Running_EUnit }

### Running EUnit

If you have added the declaration `-include_lib("eunit/include/eunit.hrl")` to
your module, as described above, you only need to compile the module, and run
the automatically exported function `test()`. For example, if your module was
named `m`, then calling `\m:test()` will run EUnit on all the tests defined in
the module. You do not need to write `-export` declarations for the test
functions. This is all done by magic.

You can also use the function `eunit:test/1` to run arbitrary tests, for example
to try out some more advanced test descriptors (see
[EUnit test representation](chapter.md#EUnit_test_representation)). For example,
running `eunit:test(m)` does the same thing as the auto-generated function
`\m:test()`, while `eunit:test({inparallel, m})` runs the same test cases but
executes them all in parallel.

_Putting tests in separate modules_{: #Putting_tests_in_separate_modules }

If you want to separate your test code from your normal code (at least for
testing the exported functions), you can simply write the test functions in a
module named `m_tests` (note: not `m_test`), if your module is named `m`. Then,
whenever you ask EUnit to test the module `m`, it will also look for the module
`m_tests` and run those tests as well. See `ModuleName` in the section
[Primitives](chapter.md#primitives) for details.

_EUnit captures standard output_{: #EUnit_captures_standard_output }

If your test code writes to the standard output, you may be surprised to see
that the text does not appear on the console when the tests are running. This is
because EUnit captures all standard output from test functions (this also
includes setup and cleanup functions, but not generator functions), so that it
can be included in the test report if errors occur. To bypass EUnit and print
text directly to the console while testing, you can write to the `user` output
stream, as in `io:format(user, "~w", [Term])`. The recommended way of doing this
is to use the EUnit [Debugging macros](chapter.md#Debugging_macros), which make
it much simpler.

For checking the output produced by the unit under test, see
[Macros for checking output](chapter.md#Macros_for_checking_output).

[](){: #Writing_test_generating_functions }

### Writing test generating functions

A drawback of simple test functions is that you must write a separate function
(with a separate name) for each test case. A more compact way of writing tests
(and much more flexible, as we shall see), is to write functions that _return_
tests, instead of _being_ tests.

A function with a name ending in `..._test_()` (note the final underscore) is
recognized by EUnit as a _test generator_ function. Test generators return a
_representation_ of a _set of tests_ to be executed by EUnit.

_Representing a test as data_{: #Representing_a_test_as_data } The most basic
representation of a test is a single fun-expression that takes no arguments. For
example, the following test generator:

```text
   basic_test_() ->
       fun () -> ?assert(1 + 1 =:= 2) end.
```

will have the same effect as the following simple test:

```text
   simple_test() ->
       ?assert(1 + 1 =:= 2).
```

(in fact, EUnit will handle all simple tests just like it handles
fun-expressions: it will put them in a list, and run them one by one).

_Using macros to write tests_{: #Using_macros_to_write_tests } To make tests
more compact and readable, as well as automatically add information about the
line number in the source code where a test occurred (and reduce the number of
characters you have to type), you can use the `_test` macro (note the initial
underscore character), like this:

```text
   basic_test_() ->
       ?_test(?assert(1 + 1 =:= 2)).
```

The `_test` macro takes any expression (the "body") as argument, and places it
within a fun-expression (along with some extra information). The body can be any
kind of test expression, just like the body of a simple test function.

_Underscore-prefixed macros create test objects_{:
#Underscore-prefixed_macros_create_test_objects } But this example can be made
even shorter\! Most test macros, such as the family of `assert` macros, have a
corresponding form with an initial underscore character, which automatically
adds a `?_test(...)` wrapper. The above example can then simply be written:

```text
   basic_test_() ->
       ?_assert(1 + 1 =:= 2).
```

which has exactly the same meaning (note the `_assert` instead of `assert`). You
can think of the initial underscore as signalling _test object_.

[](){: #An_example }

### An example

Sometimes, an example says more than a thousand words. The following small
Erlang module shows how EUnit can be used in practice.

```text
   -module(fib).
   -export([fib/1]).
   -include_lib("eunit/include/eunit.hrl").

   fib(0) -> 1;
   fib(1) -> 1;
   fib(N) when N > 1 -> fib(N-1) + fib(N-2).

   fib_test_() ->
       [?_assert(fib(0) =:= 1),
	?_assert(fib(1) =:= 1),
	?_assert(fib(2) =:= 2),
	?_assert(fib(3) =:= 3),
	?_assert(fib(4) =:= 5),
	?_assert(fib(5) =:= 8),
	?_assertException(error, function_clause, fib(-1)),
	?_assert(fib(31) =:= 2178309)
       ].
```

(Author's note: When I first wrote this example, I happened to write a `*`
instead of `+` in the `fib` function. Of course, this showed up immediately when
I ran the tests.)

See [EUnit test representation](chapter.md#EUnit_test_representation) for a full
list of all the ways you can specify test sets in EUnit.

[](){: #Disabling_testing }

### Disabling testing

Testing can be turned off by defining the `NOTEST` macro when compiling, for
example as an option to `erlc`, as in:

```text
   erlc -DNOTEST my_module.erl
```

or by adding a macro definition to the code, _before the EUnit header file is
included_:

```text
   -define(NOTEST, 1).
```

(the value is not important, but should typically be 1 or `true`). Note that
unless the `EUNIT_NOAUTO` macro is defined, disabling testing will also
automatically strip all test functions from the code, except for any that are
explicitly declared as exported.

For instance, to use EUnit in your application, but with testing turned off by
default, put the following lines in a header file:

```text
   -define(NOTEST, true).
   -include_lib("eunit/include/eunit.hrl").
```

and then make sure that every module of your application includes that header
file. This means that you have a single place to modify in order to change the
default setting for testing. To override the `NOTEST` setting without modifying
the code, you can define `TEST` in a compiler option, like this:

```text
   erlc -DTEST my_module.erl
```

See [Compilation control macros](chapter.md#Compilation_control_macros) for
details about these macros.

[](){: #Avoiding_compile-time_dependency_on_EUnit }

### Avoiding compile-time dependency on EUnit

If you are distributing the source code for your application for other people to
compile and run, you probably want to ensure that the code compiles even if
EUnit is not available. Like the example in the previous section, you can put
the following lines in a common header file:

```text
   -ifdef(TEST).
   -include_lib("eunit/include/eunit.hrl").
   -endif.
```

and, of course, also make sure that you place all test code that uses EUnit
macros within `-ifdef(TEST)` or `-ifdef(EUNIT)` sections.

[](){: #EUnit_macros }

## EUnit macros

Although all the functionality of EUnit is available even without the use of
preprocessor macros, the EUnit header file defines a number of such macros in
order to make it as easy as possible to write unit tests as compactly as
possible and without getting too many details in the way.

Except where explicitly stated, using EUnit macros will never introduce run-time
dependencies on the EUnit library code, regardless of whether your code is
compiled with testing enabled or disabled.

- [Macros for running external commands](chapter.md#Macros_for_running_external_commands)
- [Debugging macros](chapter.md#Debugging_macros)

[](){: #Basic_macros }

### Basic macros

- **`_test(Expr)`** - Turns `Expr` into a "test object", by wrapping it in a
  fun-expression and a source line number. Technically, this is the same as
  `{?LINE, fun () -> (Expr) end}`.

[](){: #Compilation_control_macros }

### Compilation control macros

- **`EUNIT`** - This macro is always defined to `true` whenever EUnit is enabled
  at compile time. This is typically used to place testing code within
  conditional compilation, as in:

  ```text
     -ifdef(EUNIT).
         % test code here
         ...
     -endif.
  ```

  e.g., to ensure that the code can be compiled without including the EUnit
  header file, when testing is disabled. See also the macros `TEST` and
  `NOTEST`.

- **`EUNIT_NOAUTO`** - If this macro is defined, the automatic exporting or
  stripping of test functions will be disabled.

- **`TEST`** - This macro is always defined (to `true`, unless previously
  defined by the user to have another value) whenever EUnit is enabled at
  compile time. This can be used to place testing code within conditional
  compilation; see also the macros `NOTEST` and `EUNIT`.

  For testing code that is strictly dependent on EUnit, it may be preferable to
  use the `EUNIT` macro for this purpose, while for code that uses more generic
  testing conventions, using the `TEST` macro may be preferred.

  The `TEST` macro can also be used to override the `NOTEST` macro. If `TEST` is
  defined _before_ the EUnit header file is included (even if `NOTEST` is also
  defined), then the code will be compiled with EUnit enabled.

- **`NOTEST`** - This macro is always defined (to `true`, unless previously
  defined by the user to have another value) whenever EUnit is _disabled_ at
  compile time. (Compare the `TEST` macro.)

  This macro can also be used for conditional compilation, but is more typically
  used to disable testing: If `NOTEST` is defined _before_ the EUnit header file
  is included, and `TEST` is _not_ defined, then the code will be compiled with
  EUnit disabled. See also [Disabling testing](chapter.md#Disabling_testing).

- **`NOASSERT`** - If this macro is defined, the assert macros will have no
  effect, when testing is also disabled. See
  [Assert macros](chapter.md#Assert_macros). When testing is enabled, the assert
  macros are always enabled automatically and cannot be disabled.

- **`ASSERT`** - If this macro is defined, it overrides the NOASSERT macro,
  forcing the assert macros to always be enabled regardless of other settings.

- **`NODEBUG`** - If this macro is defined, the debugging macros will have no
  effect. See [Debugging macros](chapter.md#Debugging_macros). `NODEBUG` also
  implies `NOASSERT`, unless testing is enabled.

- **`DEBUG`** - If this macro is defined, it overrides the NODEBUG macro,
  forcing the debugging macros to be enabled.

[](){: #Utility_macros }

### Utility macros

The following macros can make tests more compact and readable:

- **`LET(Var,Arg,Expr)`** - Creates a local binding `Var = Arg` in `Expr`. (This
  is the same as `(fun(Var)->(Expr)end)(Arg)`.) Note that the binding is not
  exported outside of `Expr`, and that within `Expr`, this binding of `Var` will
  shadow any binding of `Var` in the surrounding scope.

- **`IF(Cond,TrueCase,FalseCase)`** - Evaluates `TrueCase` if `Cond` evaluates
  to `true`, or otherwise evaluates `FalseCase` if `Cond` evaluates to `false`.
  (This is the same as
  `(case (Cond) of true->(TrueCase); false->(FalseCase) end)`.) Note that it is
  an error if `Cond` does not yield a boolean value.

[](){: #Assert_macros }

### Assert macros

(Note that these macros also have corresponding forms which start with an "`_`"
(underscore) character, as in `?_assert(BoolExpr)`, that create a "test object"
instead of performing the test immediately. This is equivalent to writing
`?_test(assert(BoolExpr))`, etc.)

If the macro `NOASSERT` is defined before the EUnit header file is included,
these macros have no effect when testing is also disabled; see
[Compilation control macros](chapter.md#Compilation_control_macros) for details.

- **`assert(BoolExpr)`** - Evaluates the expression `BoolExpr`, if testing is
  enabled. Unless the result is `true`, an informative exception will be
  generated. If there is no exception, the result of the macro expression is the
  atom `ok`, and the value of `BoolExpr` is discarded. If testing is disabled,
  the macro will not generate any code except the atom `ok`, and `BoolExpr` will
  not be evaluated.

  Typical usage:

  ```text
     ?assert(f(X, Y) =:= [])
  ```

  The `assert` macro can be used anywhere in a program, not just in unit tests,
  to check pre/postconditions and invariants. For example:

  ```text
     some_recursive_function(X, Y, Z) ->
         ?assert(X + Y > Z),
         ...
  ```

- **`assertNot(BoolExpr)`** - Equivalent to `assert(not (BoolExpr))`.

- **`assertMatch(GuardedPattern, Expr)`** - Evaluates `Expr` and matches the
  result against `GuardedPattern`, if testing is enabled. If the match fails, an
  informative exception will be generated; see the `assert` macro for further
  details. `GuardedPattern` can be anything that you can write on the left hand
  side of the `->` symbol in a case-clause, except that it cannot contain
  comma-separated guard tests.

  The main reason for using `assertMatch` also for simple matches, instead of
  matching with `=`, is that it produces more detailed error messages.

  Examples:

  ```text
     ?assertMatch({found, {fred, _}}, lookup(bloggs, Table))
  ```

  ```text
     ?assertMatch([X|_] when X > 0, binary_to_list(B))
  ```

- **`assertNotMatch(GuardedPattern, Expr)`** - The inverse case of assertMatch,
  for convenience.

- **`assertEqual(Expect, Expr)`** - Evaluates the expressions `Expect` and
  `Expr` and compares the results for equality, if testing is enabled. If the
  values are not equal, an informative exception will be generated; see the
  `assert` macro for further details.

  `assertEqual` is more suitable than `assertMatch` when the left-hand side is a
  computed value rather than a simple pattern, and gives more details than
  `?assert(Expect =:= Expr)`.

  Examples:

  ```text
     ?assertEqual("b" ++ "a", lists:reverse("ab"))
  ```

  ```text
     ?assertEqual(foo(X), bar(Y))
  ```

- **`assertNotEqual(Unexpected, Expr)`** - The inverse case of assertEqual, for
  convenience.

- **`assertException(ClassPattern, TermPattern, Expr)`**

- **`assertError(TermPattern, Expr)`**

- **`assertExit(TermPattern, Expr)`**

- **`assertThrow(TermPattern, Expr)`** - Evaluates `Expr`, catching any
  exception and testing that it matches the expected `ClassPattern:TermPattern`.
  If the match fails, or if no exception is thrown by `Expr`, an informative
  exception will be generated; see the `assert` macro for further details. The
  `assertError`, `assertExit`, and `assertThrow` macros, are equivalent to using
  `assertException` with a `ClassPattern` of `error`, `exit`, or `throw`,
  respectively.

  Examples:

  ```text
     ?assertError(badarith, X/0)
  ```

  ```text
     ?assertExit(normal, exit(normal))
  ```

  ```text
     ?assertException(throw, {not_found,_}, throw({not_found,42}))
  ```

[](){: #Macros_for_checking_output }

### Macros for checking output

The following macro can be used within a test case to retrieve the output
written to standard output.

- **`capturedOutput`** - The output captured by EUnit in the current test case,
  as a string.

  Examples:

  ```text
     io:format("Hello~n"),
     ?assertEqual("Hello\n", ?capturedOutput)
  ```

Keep in mind that external commands are highly dependent on the operating
system. You can use the standard library function `os:type()` in test generator
functions, to produce different sets of tests depending on the current operating
system.

Note: these macros introduce a run-time dependency on the EUnit library code, if
compiled with testing enabled.

- **`assertCmd(CommandString)`** - Runs `CommandString` as an external command,
  if testing is enabled. Unless the returned status value is 0, an informative
  exception will be generated. If there is no exception, the result of the macro
  expression is the atom `ok`. If testing is disabled, the macro will not
  generate any code except the atom `ok`, and the command will not be executed.

  Typical usage:

  ```text
     ?assertCmd("mkdir foo")
  ```

- **`assertCmdStatus(N, CommandString)`** - Like the `assertCmd(CommandString)`
  macro, but generates an exception unless the returned status value is `N`.

- **`assertCmdOutput(Text, CommandString)`** - Runs `CommandString` as an
  external command, if testing is enabled. Unless the output produced by the
  command exactly matches the specified string `Text`, an informative exception
  will be generated. (Note that the output is normalized to use a single LF
  character as line break on all platforms.) If there is no exception, the
  result of the macro expression is the atom `ok`. If testing is disabled, the
  macro will not generate any code except the atom `ok`, and the command will
  not be executed.

- **`cmd(CommandString)`** - Runs `CommandString` as an external command. Unless
  the returned status value is 0 (indicating success), an informative exception
  will be generated; otherwise, the result of the macro expression is the output
  produced by the command, as a flat string. The output is normalized to use a
  single LF character as line break on all platforms.

  This macro is useful in the setup and cleanup sections of fixtures, e.g., for
  creating and deleting files or perform similar operating system specific
  tasks, to make sure that the test system is informed of any failures.

  A Unix-specific example:

  ```text
     {setup,
      fun () -> ?cmd("mktemp") end,
      fun (FileName) -> ?cmd("rm " ++ FileName) end,
      ...}
  ```

### Debugging macros

To help with debugging, EUnit defines several useful macros for printing
messages directly to the console (rather than to the standard output).
Furthermore, these macros all use the same basic format, which includes the file
and line number where they occur, making it possible in some development
environments (e.g., when running Erlang in an Emacs buffer) to simply click on
the message and jump directly to the corresponding line in the code.

If the macro `NODEBUG` is defined before the EUnit header file is included,
these macros have no effect; see
[Compilation control macros](chapter.md#Compilation_control_macros) for details.

- **`debugHere`** - Just prints a marker showing the current file and line
  number. Note that this is an argument-less macro. The result is always `ok`.

- **`debugMsg(Text)`** - Outputs the message `Text` (which can be a plain
  string, an IO-list, or just an atom). The result is always `ok`.

- **`debugFmt(FmtString, Args)`** - This formats the text like
  `io:format(FmtString, Args)` and outputs it like `debugMsg`. The result is
  always `ok`.

- **`debugVal(Expr)`** - Prints both the source code for `Expr` and its current
  value. E.g., `?debugVal(f(X))` might be displayed as "`f(X) = 42`". (Large
  terms are truncated to the depth given by the macro `EUNIT_DEBUG_VAL_DEPTH`,
  which defaults to 15 but can be overridden by the user.) The result is always
  the value of `Expr`, so this macro can be wrapped around any expression to
  display its value when the code is compiled with debugging enabled.

- **`debugVal(Expr, Depth)`** - Like `debugVal(Expr)`, but prints terms
  truncated to the given depth.

- **`debugTime(Text,Expr)`** - Prints `Text` and the wall clock time for
  evaluation of `Expr`. The result is always the value of `Expr`, so this macro
  can be wrapped around any expression to show its run time when the code is
  compiled with debugging enabled. For example,
  `List1 = ?debugTime("sorting", lists:sort(List))` might show as
  "`sorting: 0.015 s`".

## EUnit test representation

The way EUnit represents tests and test sets as data is flexible, powerful, and
concise. This section describes the representation in detail.

### Simple test objects

A _simple test object_ is one of the following:

- A nullary functional value (i.e., a fun that takes zero arguments). Examples:

  ```text
     fun () -> ... end
  ```

  ```text
     fun some_function/0
  ```

  ```text
     fun some_module:some_function/0
  ```

- A tuple `{test, ModuleName, FunctionName}`, where `ModuleName` and
  `FunctionName` are atoms, referring to the function
  `ModuleName:FunctionName/0`
- (Obsolete) A pair of atoms `{ModuleName, FunctionName}`, equivalent to
  `{test, ModuleName, FunctionName}` if nothing else matches first. This might
  be removed in a future version.
- A pair `{LineNumber, SimpleTest}`, where `LineNumber` is a nonnegative integer
  and `SimpleTest` is another simple test object. `LineNumber` should indicate
  the source line of the test. Pairs like this are usually only created via
  `?_test(...)` macros; see [Basic macros](chapter.md#Basic_macros).

In brief, a simple test object consists of a single function that takes no
arguments (possibly annotated with some additional metadata, i.e., a line
number). Evaluation of the function either _succeeds_, by returning some value
(which is ignored), or _fails_, by throwing an exception.

[](){: #Test_sets_and_deep_lists }

### Test sets and deep lists

A test set can be easily created by placing a sequence of test objects in a
list. If `T_1`, ..., `T_N` are individual test objects, then `[T_1, ..., T_N]`
is a test set consisting of those objects (in that order).

Test sets can be joined in the same way: if `S_1`, ..., `S_K` are test sets,
then `[S_1, ..., S_K]` is also a test set, where the tests of `S_i` are ordered
before those of `S_(i+1)`, for each subset `S_i`.

Thus, the main representation of test sets is _deep lists_, and a simple test
object can be viewed as a test set containing only a single test; there is no
difference between `T` and `[T]`.

A module can also be used to represent a test set; see `ModuleName` under
[Primitives](chapter.md#primitives) below.

### Titles

Any test or test set `T` can be annotated with a title, by wrapping it in a pair
`{Title, T}`, where `Title` is a string. For convenience, any test which is
normally represented using a tuple can simply be given a title string as the
first element, i.e., writing `{"The Title", ...}` instead of adding an extra
tuple wrapper as in `{"The Title", {...}}`.

### Primitives

The following are primitives, which do not contain other test sets as arguments:

- **`ModuleName::atom()`** - A single atom represents a module name, and is
  equivalent to `{module, ModuleName}`. This is often used as in the call
  `eunit:test(some_module)`.

- **`{module, ModuleName::atom()}`** - This composes a test set from the
  exported test functions of the named module, i.e., those functions with arity
  zero whose names end with `_test` or `_test_`. Basically, the `..._test()`
  functions become simple tests, while the `..._test_()` functions become
  generators.

  In addition, EUnit will also look for another module whose name is
  `ModuleName` plus the suffix `_tests`, and if it exists, all the tests from
  that module will also be added. (If `ModuleName` already contains the suffix
  `_tests`, this is not done.) E.g., the specification `{module, mymodule}` will
  run all tests in the modules `mymodule` and `mymodule_tests`. Typically, the
  `_tests` module should only contain test cases that use the public interface
  of the main module (and no other code).

- **`{application, AppName::atom(), Info::list()}`** - This is a normal
  Erlang/OTP application descriptor, as found in an `.app` file. The resulting
  test set consists of the modules listed in the `modules` entry in `Info`.

- **`{application, AppName::atom()}`** - This creates a test set from all the
  modules belonging to the specified application, by consulting the
  application's `.app` file (see `{file, FileName}`), or if no such file exists,
  by testing all object files in the application's `ebin`\-directory (see
  `{dir, Path}`); if that does not exist, the `code:lib_dir(AppName)` directory
  is used.

- **`Path::string()`** - A single string represents the path of a file or
  directory, and is equivalent to `{file, Path}`, or `{dir, Path}`,
  respectively, depending on what `Path` refers to in the file system.

- **`{file, FileName::string()}`** - If `FileName` has a suffix that indicates
  an object file (`.beam`), EUnit will try to reload the module from the
  specified file and test it. Otherwise, the file is assumed to be a text file
  containing test specifications, which will be read using the standard library
  function `file:path_consult/2`.

  Unless the file name is absolute, the file is first searched for relative to
  the current directory, and then using the normal search path
  (`code:get_path()`). This means that the names of typical "app" files can be
  used directly, without a path, e.g., `"mnesia.app"`.

- **`{dir, Path::string()}`** - This tests all object files in the specified
  directory, as if they had been individually specified using
  `{file, FileName}`.

- **`{generator, GenFun::(() -> Tests)}`** - The generator function `GenFun` is
  called to produce a test set.

- **`{generator, ModuleName::atom(), FunctionName::atom()}`** - The function
  `ModuleName:FunctionName()` is called to produce a test set.

- **`{with, X::any(), [AbstractTestFun::((any()) -> any())]}`** - Distributes
  the value `X` over the unary functions in the list, turning them into nullary
  test functions. An `AbstractTestFun` is like an ordinary test fun, but takes
  one argument instead of zero - it's basically missing some information before
  it can be a proper test. In practice, `{with, X, [F_1, ..., F_N]}` is
  equivalent to `[fun () -> F_1(X) end, ..., fun () -> F_N(X) end]`. This is
  particularly useful if your abstract test functions are already implemented as
  proper functions:
  `{with, FD, [fun filetest_a/1, fun filetest_b/1, fun filetest_c/1]}` is
  equivalent to
  `[fun () -> filetest_a(FD) end, fun () -> filetest_b(FD) end, fun () -> filetest_c(FD) end]`,
  but much more compact. See also [Fixtures](chapter.md#fixtures), below.

### Control

The following representations control how and where tests are executed:

- **`{spawn, Tests}`** - Runs the specified tests in a separate subprocess,
  while the current test process waits for it to finish. This is useful for
  tests that need a fresh, isolated process state. (Note that EUnit always
  starts at least one such a subprocess automatically; tests are never executed
  by the caller's own process.)

- **`{spawn, Node::atom(), Tests}`** - Like `{spawn, Tests}`, but runs the
  specified tests on the given Erlang node.

- **`{timeout, Time::number(), Tests}`** - Runs the specified tests under the
  given timeout. Time is in seconds; e.g., 60 means one minute and 0.1 means
  1/10th of a second. If the timeout is exceeded, the unfinished tests will be
  forced to terminate. Note that if a timeout is set around a fixture, it
  includes the time for setup and cleanup, and if the timeout is triggered, the
  entire fixture is abruptly terminated (without running the cleanup). The
  default timeout for an individual test is 5 seconds.

- **`{inorder, Tests}`** - Runs the specified tests in strict order. Also see
  `{inparallel, Tests}`. By default, tests are neither marked as `inorder` or
  `inparallel`, but may be executed as the test framework chooses.

- **`{inparallel, Tests}`** - Runs the specified tests in parallel (if
  possible). Also see `{inorder, Tests}`.

- **`{inparallel, N::integer(), Tests}`** - Like `{inparallel, Tests}`, but
  running no more than `N` subtests simultaneously.

### Fixtures

A "fixture" is some state that is necessary for a particular set of tests to
run. EUnit's support for fixtures makes it easy to set up such state locally for
a test set, and automatically tear it down again when the test set is finished,
regardless of the outcome (success, failures, timeouts, etc.).

To make the descriptions simpler, we first list some definitions:

| `Setup`        | `() -> (R::any())`              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `SetupX`       | `(X::any()) -> (R::any())`      |
| `Cleanup`      | `(R::any()) -> any()`           |
| `CleanupX`     | `(X::any(), R::any()) -> any()` |
| `Instantiator` | `((R::any()) -> Tests)          | {with, [AbstractTestFun::((any()) -> any())]}` |
| `Where`        | `local                          | spawn                                          | {spawn, Node::atom()}` |

(these are explained in more detail further below.)

The following representations specify fixture handling for test sets:

- **`{setup, Setup, Tests | Instantiator}`**

- **`{setup, Setup, Cleanup, Tests | Instantiator}`**

- **`{setup, Where, Setup, Tests | Instantiator}`**

- **`{setup, Where, Setup, Cleanup, Tests | Instantiator}`** - `setup` sets up a
  single fixture for running all of the specified tests, with optional teardown
  afterwards. The arguments are described in detail below.

- **`{node, Node::atom(), Tests | Instantiator}`**

- **`{node, Node::atom(), Args::string()|[string()], Tests | Instantiator}`** - `node` is
  like `setup`, but with a built-in behaviour: it starts a follower node for the
  duration of the tests. The atom `Node` should have the format
  `nodename@full.machine.name`, and `Args` are the optional arguments to the new
  node; see `peer:start_link/1` for details. For compatibility
  reasons `Args` can be either a string or a list of strings, and if a single
  string is passed, it will be parsed into a list with `argparse` module.

- **`{foreach, Where, Setup, Cleanup, [Tests | Instantiator]}`**

- **`{foreach, Setup, Cleanup, [Tests | Instantiator]}`**

- **`{foreach, Where, Setup, [Tests | Instantiator]}`**

- **`{foreach, Setup, [Tests | Instantiator]}`** - `foreach` is used to set up a
  fixture and optionally tear it down afterwards, repeated for each single one
  of the specified test sets.

- **`{foreachx, Where, SetupX, CleanupX, Pairs::[{X::any(), ((X::any(), R::any()) -> Tests)}]}`**

- **`{foreachx, SetupX, CleanupX, Pairs}`**

- **`{foreachx, Where, SetupX, Pairs}`**

- **`{foreachx, SetupX, Pairs}`** - `foreachx` is like `foreach`, but uses a
  list of pairs, each containing an extra argument `X` and an extended
  instantiator function.

A `Setup` function is executed just before any of the specified tests are run,
and a `Cleanup` function is executed when no more of the specified tests will be
run, regardless of the reason. A `Setup` function takes no argument, and returns
some value which will be passed as it is to the `Cleanup` function. A `Cleanup`
function should do whatever necessary and return some arbitrary value, such as
the atom `ok`. (`SetupX` and `CleanupX` functions are similar, but receive one
additional argument: some value `X`, which depends on the context.) When no
`Cleanup` function is specified, a dummy function is used which has no effect.

An `Instantiator` function receives the same value as the `Cleanup` function,
i.e., the value returned by the `Setup` function. It should then behave much
like a generator (see [Primitives](chapter.md#primitives)), and return a test
set whose tests have been _instantiated_ with the given value. A special case is
the syntax `{with, [AbstractTestFun]}` which represents an instantiator function
that distributes the value over a list of unary functions; see
[Primitives](chapter.md#primitives): `{with, X, [...]}` for more details.

A `Where` term controls how the specified tests are executed. The default is
`spawn`, which means that the current process handles the setup and teardown,
while the tests are executed in a subprocess. `{spawn, Node}` is like `spawn`,
but runs the subprocess on the specified node. `local` means that the current
process will handle both setup/teardown and running the tests - the drawback is
that if a test times out so that the process is killed, the _cleanup will not be
performed_; hence, avoid this for persistent fixtures such as file operations.
In general, `local` should only be used when:

- the setup/teardown needs to be executed by the process that will run the
  tests;
- no further teardown needs to be done if the process is killed (i.e., no state
  outside the process was affected by the setup)

### Lazy generators

Sometimes, it can be convenient not to produce the whole set of test
descriptions before the testing begins; for example, if you want to generate a
huge amount of tests that would take up too much space to keep in memory all at
once.

It is fairly easy to write a generator which, each time it is called, either
produces an empty list if it is done, or otherwise produces a list containing a
single test case plus a new generator which will produce the rest of the tests.
This demonstrates the basic pattern:

```text
   lazy_test_() ->
       lazy_gen(10000).

   lazy_gen(N) ->
       {generator,
        fun () ->
            if N > 0 ->
                   [?_test(...)
                    | lazy_gen(N-1)];
               true ->
                   []
            end
        end}.
```

When EUnit traverses the test representation in order to run the tests, the new
generator will not be called to produce the next test until the previous test
has been executed.

Note that it is easiest to write this kind of recursive generator using a help
function, like the `lazy_gen/1` function above. It can also be written using a
recursive fun, if you prefer to not clutter your function namespace and are
comfortable with writing that kind of code.
