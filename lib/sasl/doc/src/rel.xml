  <description>
    <p>The <em>release resource file</em> specifies which applications are
      are included in a release (system) based on Erlang/OTP.</p>
    <p>This file is used by the functions in <c>systools</c> when generating
      start scripts (<c>.script</c>, <c>.boot</c>) and release upgrade
      files (<c>relup</c>).</p>

    <title>FILE SYNTAX</title>
    <p>The release resource file should be called <c>Name.rel</c>.</p>
    <p>The <c>.rel</c> file contains one single Erlang term, which is
      called a <em>release specification</em>.  The file has the
      following syntax:</p>
    <code type="none">
{release, {RelName,Vsn}, {erts, EVsn},
  [{Application, AppVsn} |
   {Application, AppVsn, Type} |
   {Application, AppVsn, IncApps} |
   {Application, AppVsn, Type, IncApps}]}.
    </code>
    <list type="bulleted">
      <item>
        <p><c>RelName = string()</c> is the name of the release.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>Vsn = string()</c> is the version of the release.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>EVsn = string()</c> is the version of ERTS the release is
          intended for.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>Application = atom()</c> is the name of an application
          included in the release.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>AppVsn = string()</c> is the version of an application
          included in the release.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>Type = permanent | transient | temporary | load | none</c>
          is the start type of an application included in the release.</p>
        <p>If <c>Type = permanent | transient | temporary</c>,
          the application will be loaded and started in the corresponding
          way, see <c>application(3)</c>. If <c>Type = load</c>,
          the application will only be loaded. If <c>Type = none</c>,
          the application will be neither loaded nor started, although
          the code for its modules will be loaded.
          Defaults to <c>permanent</c></p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>IncApps = [atom()]</c> is a list of applications that are
          included by an application included in the release.</p>
        <p>The list must be a subset of the included applications
          specified in the application resource file
          (<c>Application.app</c>) and overrides this value. Defaults
          to the same value as in the application resource file.</p>
      </item>
    </list>
    <note>
      <p>The list of applications must contain the <c>kernel</c> and
        <c>stdlib</c> applications.</p>
