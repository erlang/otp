  <description>
    <p>The <em>release resource file</em> specifies which applications
      are included in a release (system) based on Erlang/OTP.</p>
    <p>This file is used by the functions in 
    <seealso marker="systools"><c>systools</c></seealso> 
    when generating start scripts (<c>.script</c>, <c>.boot</c>) and 
    release upgrade files (<c>relup</c>).</p>

    <title>File Syntax</title>
    <p>The release resource file is to be called <c>Name.rel</c>.</p>
    <p>The <c>.rel</c> file contains one single Erlang term, which is
      called a <em>release specification</em>. The file has the
      following syntax:</p>
    <code type="none">
{release, {RelName,Vsn}, {erts, EVsn},
  [{Application, AppVsn} |
   {Application, AppVsn, Type} |
   {Application, AppVsn, IncApps} |
   {Application, AppVsn, Type, IncApps}]}.</code>

        <item><p>Start type of an application included in the release.</p>
          <p>If <c>Type = permanent | transient | temporary</c>, the
          application is loaded and started in the corresponding way, see
          <seealso marker="kernel:application"><c>application(3)</c></seealso>.</p>
          <p>If <c>Type = load</c>, the application is only loaded.</p>
          <p>If <c>Type = none</c>, the application is not loaded and not
          started, although the code for its modules is loaded.</p>
          <p>Defaults to <c>permanent</c></p></item>
      <tag><c>IncApps = [atom()]</c></tag>
        <item><p>A list of applications that are included by an application
          included in the release. The list must be a subset of the
          included applications
          specified in the application resource file
          (<c>Application.app</c>) and overrides this value. Defaults
          to the same value as in the application resource file.</p></item>

    <note>
      <p>The list of applications must contain the Kernel and
