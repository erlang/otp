	    <p>A mechanism for limiting the amount of text that the
	    built-in error logger events will produce has been
	    introduced. It is useful for limiting both the size of
	    log files and the CPU time used to produce them.</p>
	    <p>This mechanism is experimental in the sense that it
	    may be changed if it turns out that it does not solve the
	    problem it is supposed to solve. In that case, there may
	    be backward incompatible improvements to this
	    mechanism.</p>
	    <p>See the documentation for the config parameter
	    <c>error_logger_format_depth</c> in the Kernel
	    application for information about how to turn on this
	    feature.</p>

	    The undocumented upgrade instruction

	    removed. This instruction was added for symmetry reasons
	    in OTP R7B, but was never documented or tested.</p>
          <p>
	    The existing instruction <c>{add_module,Mod,DepMods}</c>
	    is now documented, and the complementing instruction
	    <c>{delete_module,Mod,DepMods}</c> is added.</p>

	    <em>all</em> alarms with id <c>AlarmId</c>. This is now
	    corrected according to the implementation - only the

	    cleared by the simple default handler.</p>

	    The upgrade instruction 'restart_application' would
	    earlier ignore the restart type configured in the .rel
	    file and always restart the application as permanent.
	    This is now changed, and the restart type from the .rel
	    file is used. If restart type is 'load', the application
	    will only be loaded and not started. If the restart type
	    is 'none', the application will not be loaded nor
	    started, but all modules in the application will be
	    loaded. (Thanks to Tobias Schlager for reporting this
	    problem)</p>

	    A bug in the mechanism for upgrading core parts of

	    switch of paths between stdlib and sasl in the
	    intermediate .script/.boot file. The bug was introduces

	    been corrected. (Thanks to Tobias Schlager)</p>

	    If sys.config existed, but was not readable or parseable,
	    this would not be detected until after the upgrade and at
	    the next node restart. The possibility for this to happen
	    is now reduced by adding a check to systools:make_tar
	    which fails the creation of the tar file if sys.config or
	    relup does not have reasonable contents. Note that there
	    are no detailed checks, only parsing and erlang term
	    format check.</p>

	    systools:make_script would allow {kernel,Vsn,load} in the

	    and did not start it. This has been corrected. Only start
	    type 'permanent', which is the default, is now allowed
	    for kernel and stdlib.</p>

	    file. This is corrected so they are now sorted
	    (internally between each other) in the same order as they

	    Fix the mechanism for upgrading emulator.</p>
          <p>
	    The appup files for kernel, stdlib and sasl do now
	    recognize two major releases back and include a
	    'restart_new_emulator' instruction. </p>
          <p>
	    Appup files can include regular expressions for matching
	    earlier releases.</p>
          <p>
	    The mechanism for upgrading the emulator is changed so
	    'restart_new_emulator' will be the first instruction
	    executed. The rest of the upgrade instruction will be
	    executed after the emulator restart.</p>
          <p>
	    A new upgrade instruction 'restart_emulator' is added for
	    the case where the emulator shall be restarted after all
	    other upgrade instructions.</p>

	    This is an extension to which_releases that allows a user
	    to specify the status of the releases they wish to be
	    returned. For instance it allows for quickly determining
	    which release is 'permanent' without the need of parsing
	    the entire release list. (Thanks to Joe Williams)</p>

	    Add copy of rel file in releases/Vsn in release tar file</p>
          <p>
	    systool:make_tar stores the rel file in the releases
	    directory. When unpacking with
	    release_handler:unpack_release, the file is automatically
	    moved to releases/Vsn/. If, however, the tar file is
	    unpacked manually, the rel file might not be moved, and
	    the next release unpacked might overwrite the rel file.
	    To overcome this, systools:make_tar now stores a copy of
	    the rel file in releases/Vsn/ directly and it is not
	    longer necessary to move the file after unpacking.</p>
          <p>
	    The reason for keeping the file in the releases directory
	    also is that is needs to be extracted separately before
	    the release version (Vsn) is known.</p>

	    If a new version of an application did not include any

	    code:lib_dir or code:priv_dir would then point to the old
	    location of the application. This has been corrected -
	    now code:replace_path/2 will be called for all

	    application's vsn is changed in the .rel file).</p>

          <p>
	    This patch addresses two cases where a timeout will occur
	    during upgrade. 1) if a supervisor is suspended (call to
	    get children from supervisor will hang) 2) if the child
	    spec for a supervisor incorrectly states that it is a
	    worker with a dynamic set of modules (call to get modules
	    from gen_event will hang)</p>
          <p>
	    An error report will now be printed, and the return value
	    of release_handler:install_release will indicate what
	    happened. (Thanks to joe williams)</p>

	    Remove traces of release_handler reading from filesystem
	    when it has Masters list</p>
          <p>
	    There are a couple of places in release_handler and
	    release_handler_1 that assumed it has a disk to read
	    from, which in the case of an erl_prim_loader Loader
	    other than efile is not necessarily true</p>
          <p>
	    Add check_paths/2 to do the equivalent of check_path/1
	    for when there is a Masters list</p>
          <p>
	    Change get_vsn to no longer get sent File paths but
	    instead use the Bin since beam_lib:version being sent a
	    file path causes it to read the local file system</p>
          <p>
	    Add get_current_vsn/1 as an equivalent to
	    beam_lib:version(code:which(Mod)), but using
	    erl_prim_loader:get_file instead of reading from local
	    file system</p>

	    rb:stop did sometimes return {error,running}. This came
	    from supervisor:delete_child and happened when the
	    rb_server has not yet terminated when this function was
	    called. Instead of having a separate gen_server call to
	    rb_server for stopping the process,
	    supervisor:terminate_child is now called. This is a
	    synchronous function - i.e. it waits for the process to
	    actually terminate before it returns.</p>
          <p>
	    A file descriptor leak in rb:scan_files is corrected. The
	    index file was never closed after reading.</p>
          <p>
	    A mismatch in the behavior of rb:filter, when filter
	    included 'no', is corrected. Such filters will now return
	    *all* non-matching reports, not only the 'proplist'
	    reports.</p>

	    If some, but not all, of the sasl environment variables
	    related to the log_mf_h error handler were missing sasl
	    would successfully start but silently skip starting
	    log_mf_h. This is corrected so sasl startup will now fail
	    if one or two of the three variables are given. If none
	    of the variables are given, sasl will start as before
	    without starting log_mf_h.</p>

	    Honor start type in .rel files when building relup files</p>
          <p>
	    Previously, relup file always included an
	    application:start(Application, permanent) apply
	    instruction for every application that appear in the
	    UpTo/DowFrom release file, whatever their start type in
	    the release file.</p>
          <p>
	    The new implementation fixes this bug by honoring the
	    start type according to the rel(5) format. If the start
	    type is none, no apply line is included in the relup. If
	    the start type is load, the relup includes instruction to
	    only load the application. Otherwise, the relup includes
	    an instruction to start the application to the according
	    type.</p>
          <p>
	    The fix is implemented by adding a new parameter to the
	    add_application high level appup instruction. This new
	    parameter is documented in appup(5).</p>

	    <p>In R13B04 sys:get_status was modified to invoke
	    format_status/2 in the callback module if the module
	    exports that function. This resulted in a change to the
	    term returned from calling sys:get_status on the
	    supervisor module, since supervisor is a gen_server and
	    gen_server exports format_status. The sasl
	    release_handler_1 module had a dependency on the
	    pre-R13B04 term returned by sys:get_status when invoked
	    on a supervisor, so the R13B04 change broke that
	    dependency.</p>
	    <p>This problem has been fixed by change
	    release_handler_1 to handle both the pre-R13B04 and
	    R13B04 terms that sys:get_status can return from a
	    supervisor.</p>
