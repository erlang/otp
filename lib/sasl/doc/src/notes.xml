<section><title>SASL 3.2</title>

    <section><title>Improvements and New Features</title>
      <list>
        <item>
	    <p>A new logging API is added to Erlang/OTP, see the
	    <seealso
	    marker="kernel:logger"><c>logger(3)</c></seealso> manual
	    page, and section <seealso
	    marker="kernel:logger_chapter">Logging</seealso> in the
	    Kernel User's Guide.</p>
	    <p>Calls to <c>error_logger</c> are automatically
	    redirected to the new API, and legacy error logger event
	    handlers can still be used. It is, however, recommended
	    to use the Logger API directly when writing new code.</p>
	    <p>Notice the following potential incompatibilities:</p>
	    <list> <item><p>Kernel configuration parameters
	    <c>error_logger</c> still works, but is overruled if the
	    default handler's output destination is configured with
	    Kernel configuration parameter <c>logger</c>.</p> <p>In
	    general, parameters for configuring error logger are
	    overwritten by new parameters for configuring
	    Logger.</p></item> <item><p>The concept of SASL error
	    logging is deprecated, meaning that by default the SASL
	    application does not affect which log events are
	    logged.</p> <p>By default, supervisor reports and crash
	    reports are logged by the default Logger handler started
	    by Kernel, and end up at the same destination (terminal
	    or file) as other standard log event from Erlang/OTP.</p>
	    <p>Progress reports are not logged by default, but can be
	    enabled by setting the primary log level to info, for
	    example with the Kernel configuration parameter
	    <c>logger_level</c>.</p> <p>To obtain backwards
	    compatibility with the SASL error logging functionality
	    from earlier releases, set Kernel configuration parameter
	    <c>logger_sasl_compatible</c> to <c>true</c>. This
	    prevents the default Logger handler from logging any
	    supervisor-, crash-, or progress reports. Instead, SASL
	    adds a separate Logger handler during application start,
	    which takes care of these log events. The SASL
	    configuration parameters <c>sasl_error_logger</c> and
	    <c>sasl_errlog_type</c> specify the destination (terminal
	    or file) and severity level to log for these
	    events.</p></item></list>
          <p>
	    Since Logger is new in Erlang/OTP 21.0, we do reserve the
	    right to introduce changes to the Logger API and
	    functionality in patches following this release. These
	    changes might or might not be backwards compatible with
	    the initial version.</p>

	    When creating the release tar file, systools now includes
	    sys.config.src if it exists in the
	    $ROOT/releases/&lt;vsn&gt;/ directory. This is to allow
	    adjustments, e.g. resolving environment variables, after
	    unpacking the release, but before installing it. This
	    functionality requires a custom tool which uses
	    sys.config.src as input and creates a correct sys.config
	    file.</p>

	    When upgrading with instruction 'restart_new_emulator',
	    the generated temporary boot file used 'kernelProcess'
	    statements from the old release instead of the new
	    release. This is now corrected.</p>

	    Improved dirty scheduler support. A purge of a module can
	    now be performed without having to wait for completion of
	    all ongoing dirty NIF calls.</p>
          <p>
	    Note that when enabling support for dirty schedulers, a
	    new purge strategy will as of ERTS version 8.1 be
	    enabled. This new strategy is not fully backwards
	    compatible with the strategy used by default. For more
	    information see the documentation of <seealso
	    marker="erts:erlang#check_process_code/3"><c>erlang:check_process_code/3</c></seealso>.</p>

          <p>
	    A new purge strategy has been introduced. The new
	    strategy will by default be disabled during the OTP 19
	    release, but will be the only strategy available as of
	    the OTP 20 release.</p>
          <p>
	    The new strategy is slightly incompatible with the
	    strategy being used by default in OTP 19. Using the
	    default strategy, processes holding <c>fun</c>s that
	    refer to the module being purged either fail a soft
	    purge, or will be killed during a hard purge. The new
	    strategy completely ignores <c>fun</c>s. If <c>fun</c>s
	    referring to the code being purged exist, and are used
	    after a purge, an exception will be raised upon usage.
	    That is, the behavior will be exactly the same as the
	    case when a <c>fun</c> is received by a process after the
	    purge.</p>
          <p>
	    The new strategy can optionally be enabled when building
	    OTP during OTP 19, and will automatically be enabled if
	    the runtime system is built with support for dirty
	    schedulers.</p>
          <p>

	    marker="erts:erlang#check_process_code/3"><c>erlang:check_process_code/3</c></seealso>.</p>

	    During upgrade, the release_handler collects a list of
	    supervisor pids in order to list all processes in the
	    supervisor tree. If one of the supervisors (legitimately)
	    exits before release_handler can examine it, then
	    <c>sys:get_status/1</c> would earlier be called with a
	    dead pid, causing a <c>'noproc'</c> error. This has been

	    <p>A mechanism for limiting the amount of text that the
	    built-in error logger events will produce has been
	    introduced. It is useful for limiting both the size of
	    log files and the CPU time used to produce them.</p>
	    <p>This mechanism is experimental in the sense that it
	    may be changed if it turns out that it does not solve the
	    problem it is supposed to solve. In that case, there may
	    be backward incompatible improvements to this
	    mechanism.</p>
	    <p>See the documentation for the config parameter
	    <c>error_logger_format_depth</c> in the Kernel

	    The upgrade instruction 'restart_application' would
	    earlier ignore the restart type configured in the .rel
	    file and always restart the application as permanent.
	    This is now changed, and the restart type from the .rel
	    file is used. If restart type is 'load', the application
	    will only be loaded and not started. If the restart type
	    is 'none', the application will not be loaded nor
	    started, but all modules in the application will be
	    loaded. (Thanks to Tobias Schlager for reporting this

	    A bug in the mechanism for upgrading core parts of
	    Erlang/OTP (emulator, kernel, stdlib, sasl) caused a
	    switch of paths between stdlib and sasl in the
	    intermediate .script/.boot file. The bug was introduces
	    along with this upgrade mechanism in R15B. It has now
	    been corrected. (Thanks to Tobias Schlager)</p>

	    Fix the mechanism for upgrading emulator.</p>
          <p>
	    The appup files for kernel, stdlib and sasl do now
	    recognize two major releases back and include a
	    'restart_new_emulator' instruction. </p>
          <p>
	    Appup files can include regular expressions for matching

          <p>
	    The mechanism for upgrading the emulator is changed so
	    'restart_new_emulator' will be the first instruction
	    executed. The rest of the upgrade instruction will be
	    executed after the emulator restart.</p>
          <p>
	    A new upgrade instruction 'restart_emulator' is added for
	    the case where the emulator shall be restarted after all
	    other upgrade instructions.</p>

	    Add copy of rel file in releases/Vsn in release tar file</p>
          <p>
	    systool:make_tar stores the rel file in the releases
	    directory. When unpacking with
	    release_handler:unpack_release, the file is automatically
	    moved to releases/Vsn/. If, however, the tar file is
	    unpacked manually, the rel file might not be moved, and
	    the next release unpacked might overwrite the rel file.
	    To overcome this, systools:make_tar now stores a copy of
	    the rel file in releases/Vsn/ directly and it is not
	    longer necessary to move the file after unpacking.</p>
          <p>
	    The reason for keeping the file in the releases directory
	    also is that is needs to be extracted separately before
	    the release version (Vsn) is known.</p>

	    Honor start type in .rel files when building relup files</p>
          <p>
	    Previously, relup file always included an
	    application:start(Application, permanent) apply

	    UpTo/DowFrom release file, whatever their start type in
	    the release file.</p>
          <p>
	    The new implementation fixes this bug by honoring the
	    start type according to the rel(5) format. If the start
	    type is none, no apply line is included in the relup. If
	    the start type is load, the relup includes instruction to
	    only load the application. Otherwise, the relup includes
	    an instruction to start the application to the according
	    type.</p>
          <p>
	    The fix is implemented by adding a new parameter to the
	    add_application high level appup instruction. This new
	    parameter is documented in appup(5).</p>

	    The <c>re:grep/1</c> function now uses the '<c>re</c>'
	    module instead of the deprecated '<c>regexp</c>' module.
	    There are new functions <c>rb:filter/1</c> and
	    <c>rb:filter/2</c> for easier filtering of reports.

	    There is new function <c>sasl_report:format_report/3</c>
	    that works like the existing
	    <c>sasl_report:write_report/3</c> function except that it
	    returns a formatted string. Note that there is currently
	    no documentation for the <c>sasl_report</c> module.
