	    The Report Browser, rb, could earlier not handle reports
	    that were not lists, for example generated by
	    <c>error_logger:info_report({some, tuple})</c>. This term
	    is allowed as input to error_logger, but rb would state
	    that "A report on bad form was encountered". This is now
	    corrected.</p>

	    When both options 'warnings_as_errors' and 'silent' were

	    Improved dirty scheduler support. A purge of a module can
	    now be performed without having to wait for completion of
	    all ongoing dirty NIF calls.</p>
          <p>
	    Note that when enabling support for dirty schedulers, a
	    new purge strategy will as of ERTS version 8.1 be
	    enabled. This new strategy is not fully backwards
	    compatible with the strategy used by default. For more
	    information see the documentation of <seealso
	    marker="erts:erlang#check_process_code/3"><c>erlang:check_process_code/3</c></seealso>.</p>

        <item>
          <p>
	    A new purge strategy has been introduced. The new
	    strategy will by default be disabled during the OTP 19
	    release, but will be the only strategy available as of
	    the OTP 20 release.</p>
          <p>
	    The new strategy is slightly incompatible with the
	    strategy being used by default in OTP 19. Using the
	    default strategy, processes holding <c>fun</c>s that
	    refer to the module being purged either fail a soft
	    purge, or will be killed during a hard purge. The new
	    strategy completely ignores <c>fun</c>s. If <c>fun</c>s
	    referring to the code being purged exist, and are used
	    after a purge, an exception will be raised upon usage.
	    That is, the behavior will be exactly the same as the
	    case when a <c>fun</c> is received by a process after the
	    purge.</p>
          <p>
	    The new strategy can optionally be enabled when building
	    OTP during OTP 19, and will automatically be enabled if
	    the runtime system is built with support for dirty
	    schedulers.</p>
          <p>
	    For more information see the documentation of <seealso
	    marker="erts:erlang#check_process_code/3"><c>erlang:check_process_code/3</c></seealso>.</p>

	    During upgrade, the release_handler collects a list of
	    supervisor pids in order to list all processes in the
	    supervisor tree. If one of the supervisors (legitimately)
	    exits before release_handler can examine it, then
	    <c>sys:get_status/1</c> would earlier be called with a
	    dead pid, causing a <c>'noproc'</c> error. This has been
	    corrected.</p>

	    <p>A mechanism for limiting the amount of text that the
	    built-in error logger events will produce has been
	    introduced. It is useful for limiting both the size of
	    log files and the CPU time used to produce them.</p>
	    <p>This mechanism is experimental in the sense that it
	    may be changed if it turns out that it does not solve the
	    problem it is supposed to solve. In that case, there may
	    be backward incompatible improvements to this
	    mechanism.</p>
	    <p>See the documentation for the config parameter
	    <c>error_logger_format_depth</c> in the Kernel
	    application for information about how to turn on this
	    feature.</p>

	    The upgrade instruction 'restart_application' would
	    earlier ignore the restart type configured in the .rel
	    file and always restart the application as permanent.
	    This is now changed, and the restart type from the .rel
	    file is used. If restart type is 'load', the application
	    will only be loaded and not started. If the restart type
	    is 'none', the application will not be loaded nor
	    started, but all modules in the application will be
	    loaded. (Thanks to Tobias Schlager for reporting this
	    problem)</p>

	    If sys.config existed, but was not readable or parseable,
	    this would not be detected until after the upgrade and at

	    which fails the creation of the tar file if sys.config or
	    relup does not have reasonable contents. Note that there

	    Fix the mechanism for upgrading emulator.</p>
          <p>
	    The appup files for kernel, stdlib and sasl do now
	    recognize two major releases back and include a
	    'restart_new_emulator' instruction. </p>
          <p>
	    Appup files can include regular expressions for matching
	    earlier releases.</p>
          <p>
	    The mechanism for upgrading the emulator is changed so
	    'restart_new_emulator' will be the first instruction
	    executed. The rest of the upgrade instruction will be
	    executed after the emulator restart.</p>
          <p>
	    A new upgrade instruction 'restart_emulator' is added for
	    the case where the emulator shall be restarted after all
	    other upgrade instructions.</p>

	    Add copy of rel file in releases/Vsn in release tar file</p>
          <p>
	    systool:make_tar stores the rel file in the releases
	    directory. When unpacking with
	    release_handler:unpack_release, the file is automatically
	    moved to releases/Vsn/. If, however, the tar file is
	    unpacked manually, the rel file might not be moved, and
	    the next release unpacked might overwrite the rel file.
	    To overcome this, systools:make_tar now stores a copy of
	    the rel file in releases/Vsn/ directly and it is not
	    longer necessary to move the file after unpacking.</p>
          <p>
	    The reason for keeping the file in the releases directory
	    also is that is needs to be extracted separately before
	    the release version (Vsn) is known.</p>

	    If a new version of an application did not include any

	    files in the priv dir were changed since calls to
	    code:lib_dir or code:priv_dir would then point to the old
	    location of the application. This has been corrected -
	    now code:replace_path/2 will be called for all

	    rb:stop did sometimes return {error,running}. This came

	    Honor start type in .rel files when building relup files</p>
          <p>
	    Previously, relup file always included an
	    application:start(Application, permanent) apply
	    instruction for every application that appear in the
	    UpTo/DowFrom release file, whatever their start type in
	    the release file.</p>
          <p>
	    The new implementation fixes this bug by honoring the
	    start type according to the rel(5) format. If the start
	    type is none, no apply line is included in the relup. If
	    the start type is load, the relup includes instruction to
	    only load the application. Otherwise, the relup includes
	    an instruction to start the application to the according
	    type.</p>
          <p>
	    The fix is implemented by adding a new parameter to the
	    add_application high level appup instruction. This new
	    parameter is documented in appup(5).</p>

          <p>Added an option <c>{outdir,Dir}</c> to the functions in
            <c>systools</c>, making it possible to specify in which
            directory a boot script, relup file or release package
            file should be placed.</p>
          <p>Also, when using <c>systools:make_tar/2</c> to create a
            release package file, the boot script, relup file and
            <c>sys.config</c> are now searched for also in the current
            working directory and any directory specified by
            the <c>path</c> option, not only in the directory of
            the <c>.rel</c> file.</p>
          <p>As part of the work some minor bugs have been corrected:</p>
          <list type="bulleted">
            <item>
              <p><c>systools:make_script/1,2</c> now returns

                file could not be opened for writing, not <c>ok</c>.</p>

            <item>
              <p><c>systools:make_tar/1,2</c> can now handle a
                <c>RelName</c> argument which includes a path.
                Previously this would cause the <c>.rel</c> file to end
                up in the wrong directory in the resulting tar file.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
              <p>A documentation error for <c>systools:make_tar/1,2</c>:
                The <c>.rel</c> file is placed in the <c>releases</c>
                directory in the tar file, not <c>releases/RelVsn</c>.</p>

          <p>A new option <c>{update_paths,Bool}</c> has been added
