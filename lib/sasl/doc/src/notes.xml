	    The release_handler functionality on windows services was
	    broken. This has been corrected.</p>

          <p>
	    If a new version of an application did not include any
	    erlang module changes, the code path of the application
	    was not updated by the release_handler unless a
	    'load_object_code' instruction was added for the
	    application. This would be a problem if e.g. only some
	    files in the priv dir were changed since calls to
	    code:lib_dir or code:priv_dir would then point to the old
	    location of the application. This has been corrected -
	    now code:replace_path/2 will be called for all
	    applications that are changed (i.e. when the
	    application's vsn is changed in the .rel file).</p>

          <p>
	    The appup instruction 'delete_module' would cause a crash
	    during upgrade if the module to be deleted was not
	    loaded. This has been corrected.</p>

	    If a path was given as ONLY 'ebin' and not for example
	    './ebin', then systools:make_tar would fail with a
	    <c>function_clause</c> exception in filename:join/1. This
	    has been corrected. (Thanks to Nikola Skoric for
	    reporting).</p>

	    Implement or fix -Werror option</p>
          <p>
	    If -Werror is enabled and there are warnings no output
	    file is written. Also make sure that error/warning
	    reporting is consistent. (Thanks to Tuncer Ayaz)</p>

	    Improved error information for timeouts during
	    release_handler:install_release.</p>
          <p>
	    This patch addresses two cases where a timeout will occur
	    during upgrade. 1) if a supervisor is suspended (call to
	    get children from supervisor will hang) 2) if the child
	    spec for a supervisor incorrectly states that it is a
	    worker with a dynamic set of modules (call to get modules
	    from gen_event will hang)</p>
          <p>
	    An error report will now be printed, and the return value
	    of release_handler:install_release will indicate what
	    happened. (Thanks to joe williams)</p>

	    <c>release_handler:install_release</c> could be very slow
	    when there are many processes in the system. Some
	    optimization work has been done both in erts and in the
	    release handler in order to improve this. </p>
          <p>
	    A new option, <c>purge</c>, is added to
	    <c>release_handler:check_install_release</c> which can be
	    called first in order to speed up the execution of
	    <c>release_handler:install_release</c>.</p>

	    Remove traces of release_handler reading from filesystem
	    when it has Masters list</p>
          <p>
	    There are a couple of places in release_handler and
	    release_handler_1 that assumed it has a disk to read
	    from, which in the case of an erl_prim_loader Loader
	    other than efile is not necessarily true</p>
          <p>
	    Add check_paths/2 to do the equivalent of check_path/1
	    for when there is a Masters list</p>
          <p>
	    Change get_vsn to no longer get sent File paths but
	    instead use the Bin since beam_lib:version being sent a
	    file path causes it to read the local file system</p>
          <p>
	    Add get_current_vsn/1 as an equivalent to
	    beam_lib:version(code:which(Mod)), but using
	    erl_prim_loader:get_file instead of reading from local
	    file system</p>
          <p>

          <p>
	    rb:stop did sometimes return {error,running}. This came
	    from supervisor:delete_child and happened when the
	    rb_server has not yet terminated when this function was
	    called. Instead of having a separate gen_server call to
	    rb_server for stopping the process,
	    supervisor:terminate_child is now called. This is a
	    synchronous function - i.e. it waits for the process to
	    actually terminate before it returns.</p>
          <p>
	    A file descriptor leak in rb:scan_files is corrected. The
	    index file was never closed after reading.</p>
          <p>
	    A mismatch in the behavior of rb:filter, when filter
	    included 'no', is corrected. Such filters will now return
	    *all* non-matching reports, not only the 'proplist'
	    reports.</p>

	    Start and end date for rb:filter/2 was specified as
	    {{Y-M-D},...} in the help text instead of {{Y,M,D},...}.
	    This has been corrected.</p>

	    If some, but not all, of the sasl environment variables
	    related to the log_mf_h error handler were missing sasl
	    would successfully start but silently skip starting
	    log_mf_h. This is corrected so sasl startup will now fail
	    if one or two of the three variables are given. If none
	    of the variables are given, sasl will start as before
	    without starting log_mf_h.</p>

	    Change default behaviour to not check src code when

          <p>
	    Add new option <c>src_tests</c> to systools:make_script
	    and systools:make_tar. The old option
	    <c>no_module_tests</c> is now ignored as this is the

	    Honor start type in .rel files when building relup files</p>
          <p>
	    Previously, relup file always included an
	    application:start(Application, permanent) apply
	    instruction for every application that appear in the
	    UpTo/DowFrom release file, whatever their start type in
	    the release file.</p>
          <p>
	    The new implementation fixes this bug by honoring the
	    start type according to the rel(5) format. If the start
	    type is none, no apply line is included in the relup. If
	    the start type is load, the relup includes instruction to
	    only load the application. Otherwise, the relup includes
	    an instruction to start the application to the according
	    type.</p>
          <p>
	    The fix is implemented by adding a new parameter to the
	    add_application high level appup instruction. This new
	    parameter is documented in appup(5).</p>

	    <p>In R13B04 sys:get_status was modified to invoke
	    format_status/2 in the callback module if the module
	    exports that function. This resulted in a change to the
	    term returned from calling sys:get_status on the
	    supervisor module, since supervisor is a gen_server and
	    gen_server exports format_status. The sasl
	    release_handler_1 module had a dependency on the
	    pre-R13B04 term returned by sys:get_status when invoked
	    on a supervisor, so the R13B04 change broke that
	    dependency.</p>
	    <p>This problem has been fixed by change
	    release_handler_1 to handle both the pre-R13B04 and
	    R13B04 terms that sys:get_status can return from a
	    supervisor.</p>

          <p>A new option <c>{update_paths,Bool}</c> has been added
            for <c>release_handler:install_release/2</c>. It
            indicates if all application code paths should be updated
            (<c>Bool==true</c>), or if only code paths for modified
            applications should be updated (<c>Bool==false</c>,
            default).</p>
          <p><c>release_handler:set_unpacked/2</c> now returns an
            error tuple if a specified application directory does not
            exist.</p>
          <p>*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***</p>
