          <p>When doing a code replacement in run-time, updating the
            internal state of a gen_server, gen_event or gen_fsm, it
            was stated in the documentation that the first argument
            <c>OldVsn</c> to the callback function
            <c>Module:code_change</c> was defined by the <c>vsn</c>
            attribute in the old version of <c>Module</c>.</p>
          <p>However, this was not true. For downgrades, <c>OldVsn</c>
            was <c>{down,Vsn}</c>, where <c>Vsn</c> was fetched from
            the <c>.app</c> file instead.</p>
          <p>The version is now always fetched from the module using
            <c>beam_lib:version/1</c> and the man pages for gen_*
            have been updated accordingly.</p>

        <item>
          <p>The release handling instruction
            <c>restart_application</c> was translated to the
            low-level instruction <c>application_remove</c> and a set
            of <c>load_module</c> instructions.</p>
          <p>However, <c>application_remove</c> caused the modules
            listed for the new, not the old, version of the
            application to be unloaded. If the set of modules was
            changed, this meant the release handler would try to
            purge non-existent modules and/or forget to unload
            modules no longer used.</p>
          <p><c>restart_application</c> is now translated to a correct
            set of <c>delete_module</c> and <c>add_module</c>
            instructions instead, and the <c>application_remove</c>
            instruction is deprecated.</p>

        <item>
          <p><c>release_handler:check_install_release/1</c> returned
            <c>{error,Reason}</c> if <c>sys.config</c> or
            <c>relup</c> was missing. Since both these files are
            optional, the behaviour has been changed to write
            warnings to the terminal but return an <c>ok</c> tuple
            instead.</p>

        <item>
          <p>Added a clause to <c>systools:make_script/1</c> which
            makes it possible to provide (atomic) options when
            calling the function using <c>erl -s</c>.</p>
          <p>Example: <c>erl -noinput +B -s systools make_script myrel no_module_tests -s erlang halt</c> is equal to calling
            <c>systools:make_script("myrel", [no_module_tests])</c>.</p>

          <p>Added simplified versions of the <c>update</c> and

        <item>
          <p>Added two new release handling instructions: <c>{update, Module, supervisor}</c> and <c>{delete_module, Module}</c>.</p>

        <item>
          <p>The option <c>{abort_on_error,Bool}</c> has been added to
            <c>rb:start/1</c> and <c>rb:rescan/1</c>. With it you can
            choose whether or not rb should stop logging if it
            encounters an unprintable report. When <c>abort_on_error</c>
            is set to <c>false</c>, rb will resume logging after a bad
            report has been handled. The error messages rb prints when
            logging fails have been enhanced.</p>
