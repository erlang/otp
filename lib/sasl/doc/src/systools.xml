        <p>Generates a release upgrade file <c>relup</c> containing instructions 
	for upgrading from or downgrading to one or more previous releases. 
	The instructions are used by 
	<seealso marker="release_handler"><c>release_handler</c></seealso> 
	when installing a new version of a release in runtime.</p>
        <p>By default, <c>relup</c> file is located in the current working
          directory. If option <c>{outdir,Dir}</c> is specified,
          the <c>relup</c> file is located in <c>Dir</c> instead.</p>
        <p>The release resource file <c>Name.rel</c> is compared with
          all release resource files <c>Name2.rel</c>, specified in
          <c>UpFrom</c> and <c>DownTo</c>. For each such pair, the
          following is deducted:</p>
        <list type="bulleted">
          <item>
            <p>Which applications to be deleted, that is,
              applications listed in <c>Name.rel</c> but not
              in <c>Name2.rel</c></p>
          </item>
          <item>
            <p>Which applications to be added, that is, applications
              listed in <c>Name2.rel</c> but not in <c>Name.rel</c></p>
          </item>
          <item>
            <p>Which applications to be upgraded/downgraded, that
              is, applications listed in both <c>Name.rel</c> and
              <c>Name2.rel</c> but with different versions</p>
          </item>
          <item>
            <p>If the emulator needs to be restarted after upgrading or
              downgrading, that is, if the ERTS version differs
              between <c>Name.rel</c> and <c>Name2.rel</c></p>
          </item>
        </list>
        <p>Instructions for this are added to the <c>relup</c> file in
          the above order. Instructions for upgrading or downgrading
          between application versions are fetched from the relevant
          application upgrade files <c>App.appup</c>, sorted in
          the same order as when generating a boot script, see
          <seealso marker="#make_script/1"><c>make_script/1,2</c></seealso>. 
	  High-level instructions are translated
          into low-level instructions and the result is printed to the
          <c>relup</c> file.</p>
        <p>The optional <c>Descr</c> parameter is included "as is" in
          the <c>relup</c> file, see
          <seealso marker="relup"><c>relup(4)</c></seealso>. Defaults to
          the empty list.</p>
        <p>All the files are searched for in the code path. It is
          assumed that the <c>.app</c> and <c>.appup</c> files for an
          application are located in the same directory.</p>
        <p>If option <c>{path,[Dir]}</c> is specified, this path is
          appended to the current path. Wildcard <c>*</c> is
          expanded to all matching directories, for example,
          <c>lib/*/ebin</c>.</p>
        <p>If option <c>restart_emulator</c> is specified, a
          low-level instruction to restart the emulator is appended to
          the <c>relup</c> file. This ensures that a complete reboot of
          the system is done when the system is upgraded or downgraded.</p>
        <p>If an upgrade includes a change from an emulator earlier
          than OTP R15 to OTP R15 or later, the warning
          <c>pre_R15_emulator_upgrade</c> is issued. For more information
          about this, see
          <seealso marker="doc/design_principles:appup_cookbook">Design
          Principles</seealso> in <em>System Documentation</em>.</p>
        <p>By default, errors and warnings are printed to tty and
          the function returns <c>ok</c> or <c>error</c>. If option
          <c>silent</c> is specified, the function instead either returns
          <c>{ok,Relup,Module,Warnings}</c>, where <c>Relup</c> is
          the release upgrade file, or <c>{error,Module,Error}</c>.
          Warnings and errors can be converted to strings by calling
          <c>Module:format_warning(Warnings)</c> or
          <c>Module:format_error(Error)</c>.</p>
        <p>If option <c>noexec</c> is specified, the function returns
          the same values as for <c>silent</c> but no <c>relup</c> file
          is created.</p>
        <p>If option <c>warnings_as_errors</c> is specified, warnings
          are treated as errors.</p>

      <desc>
        <p>Generates a boot script <c>Name.script</c> and its binary
          version, the boot file <c>Name.boot</c>. The boot file
          specifies which code to be loaded and which applications
          to be started when the Erlang runtime system is started.
          See <seealso marker="script"><c>script(4)</c></seealso>.</p>
        <p>The release resource file <c>Name.rel</c> is read to determine
          which applications are included in the release. Then
          the relevant application resource files <c>App.app</c> are read
          to determine which modules to be loaded, and if and
          how the applications are to be started. (Keys <c>modules</c>
          and <c>mod</c>, see
          <seealso marker="kernel:app"><c>app(4)</c></seealso>.</p>
        <p>By default, the boot script and boot file are located in
          the same directory as <c>Name.rel</c>. That is, in the current
          working directory unless <c>Name</c> contains a path. If
          option <c>{outdir,Dir}</c> is specified, they are located
          in <c>Dir</c> instead.</p>
        <p>The correctness of each application is checked as follows:</p>
        <list type="bulleted">
          <item>
            <p>The version of an application specified in
              the <c>.rel</c> file is to be the same as the version
              specified in the <c>.app</c> file.</p>
          </item>
          <item>
            <p>There are to be no undefined applications, that is,
              dependencies to applications that are not included in
              the release. (Key <c>applications</c> in the <c>.app</c>
              file).</p>
          </item>
          <item>
            <p>There are to be no circular dependencies among
              the applications.</p>
          </item>
          <item>
            <p>There are to be no duplicated modules, that is, modules with
              the same name but belonging to different applications.</p>
          </item>
          <item>
            <p>If option <c>src_tests</c> is specified, a
              warning is issued if the source code for a module is
              missing or is newer than the object code.</p>
          </item>
        </list>
        <p>The applications are sorted according to the dependencies
          between the applications. Where there are no dependencies,
          the order in the <c>.rel</c> file is kept.</p>
        <p>The function fails if the mandatory
          applications Kernel and STDLIB are not
          included in the <c>.rel</c> file and have start
          type <c>permanent</c> (which is default).</p>
        <p>If SASL is not included as an application in
          the <c>.rel</c> file, a warning is issued because such a
          release cannot be used in an upgrade. To turn off this
          warning, add option <c>no_warn_sasl</c>.</p>
        <p>All files are searched for in the current path. It is
          assumed that the <c>.app</c> and <c>.beam</c> files for an
          application are located in the same directory. The <c>.erl</c>
          files are also assumed to be located in this directory, unless
          it is an <c>ebin</c> directory in which case they can be
          located in the corresponding <c>src</c> directory.</p>
        <p>If option <c>{path,[Dir]}</c> is specified, this path is
          appended to the current path. A directory in the path can be
          specified with a wildcard <c>*</c>, this is expanded to all
          matching directories. Example: <c>"lib/*/ebin"</c>.</p>
        <p>In the generated boot script all application directories are
          structured as <c>App-Vsn/ebin</c>. They are assumed to be located
          in <c>$ROOT/lib</c>, where <c>$ROOT</c> is the root directory
          of the installed release. If option <c>local</c> is
          specified, the actual directories where the applications were
          found are used instead. This is a useful way to test a
          generated boot script locally.</p>
        <p>Option <c>variables</c> can be used to specify an
          installation directory other than <c>$ROOT/lib</c> for some of
          the applications. If a variable <c>{VarName,Prefix}</c> is
          specified and an application is found in a directory
          <c>Prefix/Rest/App[-Vsn]/ebin</c>, this application gets
          the path <c>VarName/Rest/App-Vsn/ebin</c> in the boot script.
          If an application is found in a directory <c>Prefix/Rest</c>,
          the path is <c>VarName/Rest/App-Vsn/ebin</c>. When
          starting Erlang, all variables <c>VarName</c> are given
          values using command-line flag <c>boot_var</c>.</p>
        <p><em>Example:</em> If option <c>{variables,[{"TEST","lib"}]}</c>
          is specified and <c>myapp.app</c> is found in
          <c>lib/myapp/ebin</c>, the path to this application in
          the boot script is <c>"$TEST/myapp-1/ebin"</c>. If
          <c>myapp.app</c> is found in <c>lib/test</c>, the path
          is <c>$TEST/test/myapp-1/ebin</c>.</p>
        <p>The checks performed before the boot script is generated can
          be extended with some cross reference checks by specifying
          option <c>exref</c>. These checks are performed with
          the Xref tool. All applications, or the applications specified
          with <c>{exref,[App]}</c>, are checked by Xref and
          warnings are issued for calls to undefined functions.</p>
        <p>By default, errors and warnings are printed to tty and
          the function returns <c>ok</c> or <c>error</c>. If option
          <c>silent</c> is specified, the function instead returns
          <c>{ok,Module,Warnings}</c> or <c>{error,Module,Error}</c>.
          Warnings and errors can be converted to strings by calling
          <c>Module:format_warning(Warnings)</c> or
          <c>Module:format_error(Error)</c>.</p>
        <p>If option <c>warnings_as_errors</c> is specified, warnings
          are treated as errors.</p>
        <p>If option <c>no_dot_erlang</c> is specified, the instruction to
          load the <c>.erlang</c> file during boot is <em>not</em>
          included.</p>

      </type>
      <desc>
        <p>Creates a release package file <c>Name.tar.gz</c>.
          This file must be uncompressed and unpacked on the target
          system using 
	  <seealso marker="release_handler"><c>release_handler</c></seealso> 
	  before the new release can be installed.</p>
        <p>The release resource file <c>Name.rel</c> is read to determine
          which applications are included in the release. Then
          the relevant application resource files <c>App.app</c> are
          read to determine the version and modules of each application
          (keys <c>vsn</c> and <c>modules</c>, see
          <seealso marker="kernel:app"><c>app(4)</c></seealso>).</p>
        <p>By default, the release package file is located in the same
          directory as <c>Name.rel</c>. That is, in the current working
          directory unless <c>Name</c> contains a path. If option
          <c>{outdir,Dir}</c> is specified, it is located in <c>Dir</c>
          instead.</p>
        <p>If SASL is not included as an application in
          the <c>.rel</c> file, a warning is issued because such a
          release cannot be used in an upgrade. To turn off this
          warning, add option <c>no_warn_sasl</c>.</p>
        <p>By default, the release package contains the directories
          <c>lib/App-Vsn/ebin</c> and <c>lib/App-Vsn/priv</c> for each
          included application. If more directories are to be included,
          option <c>dirs</c> is specified, for example,
          <c>{dirs,[src,examples]}</c>.</p>
        <p>All these files are searched for in the current path. If
          option <c>{path,[Dir]}</c> is specified, this path is
          appended to the current path. Wildcard <c>*</c> is
          expanded to all matching directories.
          Example: <c>"lib/*/ebin"</c>.</p>
        <p>Option <c>variables</c> can be used to specify an
          installation directory other than <c>lib</c> for some of
          the applications. If variable <c>{VarName,Prefix}</c> is
          specified and an application is found in directory
          <c>Prefix/Rest/App[-Vsn]/ebin</c>, this application is
          packed into a separate <c>VarName.tar.gz</c> file as
          <c>Rest/App-Vsn/ebin</c>.</p>
        <p><em>Example:</em> If option <c>{variables,[{"TEST","lib"}]}</c>
          is specified and <c>myapp.app</c> is located in
          <c>lib/myapp-1/ebin</c>, application <c>myapp</c> is

        <pre>
% <input>tar tf TEST.tar</input>
myapp-1/ebin/myapp.app
...</pre>
        <p>Option <c>{var_tar,VarTar}</c> can be used to specify if
          and where a separate package is to be stored. In this option
          <c>VarTar</c> is one of the following:</p>
        <taglist>
          <tag><c>include</c></tag>
            <item><p>Each separate (variable) package is included in the

        <p>A directory <c>releases</c> is also included in
          the release package, containing <c>Name.rel</c> and a
          subdirectory <c>RelVsn</c>. <c>RelVsn</c> is
          the release version as specified in <c>Name.rel</c>.</p>
        <p><c>releases/RelVsn</c> contains the boot script
          <c>Name.boot</c> renamed to <c>start.boot</c> and, if found,
          the files <c>relup</c> and <c>sys.config</c> or <c>sys.config.src</c>. These files
          are searched for in the same directory as <c>Name.rel</c>,
          in the current working directory, and in any directories
          specified using option <c>path</c>. In the case of <c>sys.config</c>
          it is not included if <c>sys.config.src</c> is found.</p>
        <p>If the release package is to contain a new Erlang runtime
          system, the <c>bin</c> directory of the specified runtime
          system <c>{erts,Dir}</c> is copied to <c>erts-ErtsVsn/bin</c>.</p>
        <p>All checks with function
