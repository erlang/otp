  use timeout like this (delay in ms):

  if (timeout(delay,fun(a,b,c))) {
      printf("timeout occurred\n");
  }
  else {
      ... 
  }

If the call to fun() has not returned before 'delay' ms, it will be
interrupted and and timeout() will return a non-zero value.

If fun() finishes before 'delay' ms, then timeout will return 0.

If you need the return value from fun then assign it like this:

  if (timeout(delay,(x = fun(...)))) {
  }

These functions work by setting and catching SIGALRM, and although it
saves and restores the signal handler, it may not work in situations
where you are already using SIGALRM (this includes calls to sleep(3)).

Note that although recursive calls to timeout will not fail, they may
not give the expected results. All invocations of timeout use the same
timer, which is set on entrance to timeout and restored on exit from
timeout. So although an inner call to timeout will restart the timer
for any pending outer call when it exits, any time that has already
elapsed against the outer timeout is forgotten. In addition, the alarm
signal will always go to the innermost (last called) timeout, which
may or may not be the intention in recursive cases.
