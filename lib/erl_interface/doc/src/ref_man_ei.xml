    <note><p>The support for VxWorks is deprecated as of OTP 22, and
    will be removed in OTP 23.</p></note>
    <note><p>The old legacy <c>erl_interface</c> library (functions
    with prefix <c>erl_</c>) is deprecated as of OTP 22, and will be
    removed in OTP 23. This does not apply to the <c>ei</c>
    library. Reasonably new <c>gcc</c> compilers will issue deprecation
    warnings. In order to disable these warnings, define the macro
    <c>EI_NO_DEPR_WARN</c>.</p></note>
    <note>
      <p>By default, the <c>ei</c> library is only guaranteed
        to be compatible with other Erlang/OTP components from the same
        release as the <c>ei</c> library itself. See the documentation of the
        <seealso marker="ei#ei_set_compat_rel">ei_set_compat_rel()</seealso>
        function on how to communicate with Erlang/OTP components from earlier
        releases.</p>
