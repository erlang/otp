          <p>In order to conform to the Erlang specification,
            comparison between two pids was changed in the R9B
            release. This change did however break a deadlock
            prevention algorithm used by Mnesia during release
            upgrade. Therefore, comparison between two pids has been
            changed back so that R9B nodes are compatible with Erlang
            nodes running pre-R9 releases.</p>

          <p>The node local id consist of two integers; serial which
            is most significant, and number.</p>
          <p>The Erlang specification states: If t1 and t2 are both
            refs, both PIDs, or both ports, then t1 precedes t2 if

          <p>The reference type has been extended from 18 bits to
            82 bits. For compatibility with older nodes, an R6 node
            can send a ref to an older node; if the older node sends
            it back, it has lost all but its 18 least significant
            bits, but still compares equal to the original ref.
            The external format has been extended to represent the new
            longer refs; that means for example that binaries with
            refs, produced on an R6 node, cannot be converted to a
            term on an older node.
            In <c><![CDATA[erl_interface]]></c>, a function <c><![CDATA[erl_mk_long_ref]]></c>
            has been added, and macros <c><![CDATA[ERL_REF_NUMBERS]]></c> and
