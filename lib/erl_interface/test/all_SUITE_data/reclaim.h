/* The Erlang release for VxWorks includes a simple mechanism for
   "resource reclamation" at task exit - it allows replacement of the
   functions that open/close "files" and malloc/free memory with versions
   that keep track, to be able to "reclaim" file descriptors and memory
   when a task exits (regardless of *how* it exits).

   The interface to this mechanism is made available via this file,
   with the following caveats:

   - The interface may change (or perhaps even be removed, though that
     isn't likely until VxWorks itself provides similar functionality)
     in future releases - i.e. you must always use the version of this
     file that comes with the Erlang release you are using.

   - Disaster is guaranteed if you use the mechanism incorrectly (see
     below for the correct way), e.g. allocate memory with the "tracking"
     version of malloc() and free it with the "standard" version of free().

   - The mechanism (of course) incurs some performance penalty - thus
     for a simple program you may be better off with careful programming,
     making sure that you do whatever close()/free()/etc calls that are
     appropriate at all exit points (though if you need to guard against
     taskDelete() etc, things get messy...).

   To use the mechanism, simply program your application normally, i.e.
   use open()/close()/malloc()/free() etc as usual, but #include this
   file before any usage of the relevant functions. NOTE: To avoid the
   "disaster" mentioned above, you *must* #include it in *all* (or none)
   of the files that manipulate a particular file descriptor, allocated
   memory area, etc.

   Before any task that uses this utility is loaded (which includes the 
   erlang emulator), the reclaim.o object file has to be loaded and
   the function reclaim_init() has to be called. reclaim_init should be called
   only _ONCE_ in a systems lifetime and has only a primitive guard
   against multiple calls (i.e. a global variable is checked). Therefore
   the initialization should occur either in the start script of the system
   or (even better) in the usrInit() part of system initialization. The 
   object file itself should be loaded only once, so linking it with the
   kernel is a good idea, linking with each application is an extremely bad 
   dito. Make really sure that it's loaded _before_ any application that 
   uses it if You want to load it in the startup script.

   If You dont want to have #define's for the posix/stdio names
   of the file/memory operations (i.e. no #define malloc save_malloc etc),
   #define RECLAIM_NO_ALIAS in Your source before reclaim.h is included.
