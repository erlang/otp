  <description>
    <p>The module <c>instrument</c> contains support for studying the resource
      usage in an Erlang runtime system. Currently, only the allocation of
      memory can be studied.</p>
    <note>
      <p>Since this module inspects internal details of the runtime system it
      may differ greatly from one version to another. We make no compatibility
      guarantees in this module.</p>

  <datatypes>
    <datatype>
      <name name="block_histogram"/>
      <desc>
        <p>A histogram of block sizes where each interval's upper bound is 
          twice as high as the one before it.</p>
        <p>The upper bound of the first interval is provided by the function
           that returned the histogram, and the last interval has no upper
           bound.</p>
        <p>For example, the histogram below has 40 (<c>message</c>) blocks
           between 256-512 bytes in size, 78 blocks between 512-1024 bytes,2
           blocks between 1-2KB, and 2 blocks between 2-4KB.</p>

    <datatype>
      <name name="allocation_summary"/>
      <desc>
        <p>A summary of allocated block sizes (including their headers) grouped
          by their <c><anno>Origin</anno></c> and <c><anno>Type</anno></c>.</p>
        <p><c><anno>Origin</anno></c> is generally which NIF or driver that
          allocated the blocks, or 'system' if it could not be determined.</p>
        <p><c><anno>Type</anno></c> is the allocation category that the blocks
          belong to, e.g. <c>db_term</c>, <c>message</c> or <c>binary</c>. The
          categories correspond to those in
          <url href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/master/erts/emulator/beam/erl_alloc.types">
          erl_alloc.types</url>.</p>
        <p>If one or more carriers could not be scanned in full without harming
          the responsiveness of the system, <c><anno>UnscannedSize</anno></c>
          is the number of bytes that had to be skipped.</p>
       </desc>
    </datatype>
    <datatype>
      <name name="carrier_info_list"/>
      <desc>
        <p><c><anno>AllocatorType</anno></c> is the type of the allocator that
          employs this carrier.</p>
        <p><c><anno>InPool</anno></c> is whether the carrier is in the
          migration pool.</p>
        <p><c><anno>TotalSize</anno></c> is the total size of the carrier,
          including its header.</p>
        <p><c><anno>Allocations</anno></c> is a summary of the allocated blocks
          in the carrier. Note that carriers may contain multiple different
          block types when carrier pools are shared between different allocator
          types (see the <seecref marker="erts:erts_alloc#M_cp"><c>erts_alloc</c>
          </seecref> documentation for more details).</p>
        <p><c><anno>FreeBlocks</anno></c> is a histogram of the free block
          sizes in the carrier.</p>
        <p>If the carrier could not be scanned in full without harming the
          responsiveness of the system, <c><anno>UnscannedSize</anno></c> is
          the number of bytes that had to be skipped.</p>

      <fsummary>Return a summary of all allocations filtered by allocator type
        and scheduler id.</fsummary>
      <desc>
        <p>Returns a summary of all tagged allocations in the system,
          optionally filtered by allocator type and scheduler id.</p>
        <p>Only binaries and allocations made by NIFs and drivers are tagged by
          default, but this can be configured an a per-allocator basis with the
          <seecref marker="erts:erts_alloc#M_atags"><c>+M&lt;S&gt;atags</c>
          </seecref> emulator option.</p>
        <p>If the specified allocator types are not enabled, the call will fail
          with <c>{error, not_enabled}</c>.</p>
        <p>The following options can be used:</p>

          <tag><c>allocator_types</c></tag>
          <item>
            <p>The allocator types that will be searched.</p>
            <p>Specifying a specific allocator type may lead to strange results
              when carrier migration between different allocator types has been
              enabled: you may see unexpected types (e.g. process heaps when
              searching binary_alloc), or fewer blocks than expected if the
              carriers the blocks are on have been migrated out to an allocator
              of a different type.</p>
            <p>Defaults to all <c>alloc_util</c> allocators.</p>

          <tag><c>scheduler_ids</c></tag>
          <item>

              scheduler id of 0 will refer to the global instance that is not
