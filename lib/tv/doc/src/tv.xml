  <description>
    <p>TV enables the user to examine ETS and Mnesia tables. Once 
      a certain table has been opened in the tool, the content may be viewed at 
      various levels of detail. The content viewed may also be sorted, using any 
      element as key. The table may be polled anytime; either regularly at 
      specified intervals, or manually. New and deleted objects, as well as those 
      altered, are marked with characteristic colors. </p>
