    <title>Purpose</title>

    <p>Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol for secure remote login and
    other secure network services over an insecure network. SSH
    provides a single, full-duplex, byte-oriented connection between
    client and server. The protocol also provides privacy, integrity,
    server authentication and man-in-the-middle protection.</p>

    <p>The Erlang SSH application is an implementation of the SSH
    protocol in Erlang which offers API functions to write customized
    SSH clients and servers as well as making the Erlang shell
    available via SSH. Also included in the SSH application are an
    SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) client <seealso
    marker="ssh_sftp">ssh_sftp</seealso> and server <seealso
    marker="ssh_sftp">ssh_sftpd</seealso>.</p>
