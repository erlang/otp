	    Ssh crashed if a message was sent on a channel with

          <p>
	    A new option for ssh:daemon is also introduced:

	    the least max packet size declaration that the daemon
	    will accept from a client. The default value is 0 to

	    The internal group to user_drv protocol has been changed

	    standard_output device and the ssh application when
	    acting as a client. </p>

          <p>
	    One usage is to filter out messages that are not wanted
	    in the error logger as info reports. An example of such a

	    received if a connection has keep_alive and the peer is

	    Hooks for funs that can change binaries sent to remote
	    sites from erl_tar for renote tar file creation are
	    added. See <c>ssh_sftp:open_tar/3,4</c> for details. The
	    hooks could also be used to read remote tar files that
	    need transformation before file extraction.</p>
          <p>
	    Those hooks are intended for encryption and decryption of
	    tar files. Effort is put into memory, disk and network
	    resource economy.</p>

	    Integrate elliptic curve contribution from Andreas
	    Schultz </p>
          <p>
	    In order to be able to support elliptic curve cipher
	    suites in SSL/TLS, additions to handle elliptic curve
	    infrastructure has been added to public_key and crypto.</p>
          <p>
	    This also has resulted in a rewrite of the crypto API to
	    gain consistency and remove unnecessary overhead. All OTP
	    applications using crypto has been updated to use the new
	    API.</p>
          <p>
	    Impact: Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) offers
	    equivalent security with smaller key sizes than other
	    public key algorithms. Smaller key sizes result in
	    savings for power, memory, bandwidth, and computational
	    cost that make ECC especially attractive for constrained
	    environments.</p>

	    Changed ssh implementation to use the public_key

	    Additionally the test suites where improved so that they
	    do not copy the users keys to test server directories as
	    this is a security liability. Also ipv6 and file access
	    issues found in the process has been fixed.</p>

            The erlang ssh server has presented itself incorrectly,
            using the special version ssh-1.99, although it never has
            supported versions below 2.0. Since ssh-1.1 client
            versions below 2.0 are correctly rejected instead of
            letting the server crash later on. Alas the problem with
            the presentation string was not discovered until after
            ssh.1.1 was released. Now the server will present itself
            as ssh-2.0.</p>

	New API module ssh_channel has been added. This is a
	behaviour to facilitate the implementation of ssh clients
	and plug in subsystems to the ssh daemon. Note that this
	slightly changes the options to the API function
	ssh:daemon/[1,2,3] deprecating all no longer documented
	options. Note that the new API enforces the "logical way"
	of using the old API i.e. making the subsystem process
	part of the ssh applications supervisor tree, so missuses
      of the old API are not compatible with the new API.</p>
