	    Added ssh_compat_SUITE.</p>
          <p>
	    This suite contains a number of interoperability tests
	    mainly with OpenSSH. The tests start docker containers
	    with different OpenSSH and OpenSSL/LibreSSLcryptolib
	    versions and performs a number of tests of supported
	    algorithms.</p>
          <p>
	    All login methods and all user's public key types are
	    tested both for the client and the server.</p>
          <p>
	    All algorithms for kex, cipher, host key, mac and
	    compressions are tested with a number of exec and sftp
	    tests, both for the client and the server.</p>

	    The internal handling of SSH options is re-written.</p>
          <p>
	    Previously there were no checks if a client option was
	    given to a daemon or vice versa. This is corrected now.
	    If your code has e.g. a client-only option in a call to
	    start a daemon, the call will fail.</p>

	    Modernization of key exchange algorithms. See
	    draft-ietf-curdle-ssh-kex-sha2 for a discussion.</p>
          <p>
	    Removed an outdated weak algorithm and added stronger
	    replacements to keep interoperability with other modern
	    ssh clients and servers. The default ordering of the
	    algorithms is also adjusted.</p>
          <p>
	    Retired: The nowadays unsecure key-exchange
	    <c>diffie-hellman-group1-sha1</c> is not enabled by
	    default, but can be enabled with the option
	    <c>preferred-algorithms</c>.</p>
          <p>
	    Added: The new stronger key-exchange
	    <c>diffie-hellman-group16-sha512</c>,
	    <c>diffie-hellman-group18-sha512</c> and
	    <c>diffie-hellman-group14-sha256</c> are added and
	    enabled by default.</p>
          <p>
	    The questionable [RFC 6194] sha1-based algorithms
	    <c>diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1</c> and
	    <c>diffie-hellman-group14-sha1</c> are however still kept
	    enabled by default for compatibility with ancient clients
	    and servers that lack modern key-exchange alternatives.
	    When the draft-ietf-curdle-ssh-kex-sha2 becomes an rfc,
	    those sha1-based algorithms and
	    <c>diffie-hellman-group1-sha1</c> will be deprecated by
	    IETF. They might then be removed from the default list in
	    Erlang/OTP.</p>

	    value was used in <c>Host</c> argument or <c>ip</c>
	    option. This is (hopefully) resolved now, but it may
	    cause incompatibilities for code using both <c>Host</c>
	    and the <c>ip</c> option. The value 'loopback' has been
	    added for a correct way of naming those addresses.</p>

	    The <c>ssh_connection_handler</c> module in SSH is
	    changed and now uses the new behaviour <c>gen_statem</c>. </p>
          <p>
	    The module can be used as an example of a
	    <c>gen_statem</c> callback module but with a warning:
	    This commit of ssh is just a straightforward port from
	    gen_fsm to gen_statem with some code cleaning. Since the
	    state machine and the state callbacks are almost
	    unchanged the ssh module does not demonstrate the full
	    potential of the new behaviour.</p>
          <p>
	    The "new" state machine uses compound states. The ssh
	    server and client state machines are quite similar but
	    differences exist. With <c>gen_fsm</c> there were flags
	    in the user data which in fact implemented "substates".
	    Now with <c>gen_statem</c> those are made explicit in the
	    state names, eg. the state <c>userauth</c> and the binary
	    <c>role</c>-flag becomes the two state names
	    <c>{userauth, server}</c> and <c>{userauth, client}</c>.</p>

	    The option <c>key_cb</c> is extended to take an optional
	    list that is passed to the callback module as an option.
	    With this it is possible to have different keys depending
	    on which host that is connected. Another possibility is
	    to write a callback module that fetches keys etc from a
	    database.</p>

	    The {timeout, Timeout} option passed to

	    through to ssh:connect. In case the timeout occurs during
	    these phases, {error, timeout} is returned. (Thanks to

	    Supports tar file creation on other media than file
	    systems mounted on the local machine.</p>
          <p>
	    The <c>erl_tar</c> api is extended with
	    <c>erl_tar:init/3</c> that enables usage of user provided
	    media storage routines. A ssh-specific set of such
	    routines is hidden in the new function
	    <c>ssh_sftp:open_tar/3</c> to simplify creating a tar
	    archive on a remote ssh server.</p>
          <p>
	    A chunked file reading option is added to
	    <c>erl_tar:add/3,4</c> to save memory on e.g small
	    embedded systems. The size of the slices read from a file
	    in that case can be specified.</p>

	    hooks could also be used to read remote tar files that
	    need transformation before file extraction.</p>
          <p>

	    Integrate elliptic curve contribution from Andreas
	    Schultz </p>
          <p>
	    In order to be able to support elliptic curve cipher
	    suites in SSL/TLS, additions to handle elliptic curve
	    infrastructure has been added to public_key and crypto.</p>
          <p>
	    This also has resulted in a rewrite of the crypto API to
	    gain consistency and remove unnecessary overhead. All OTP
	    applications using crypto has been updated to use the new
	    API.</p>
          <p>
	    Impact: Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) offers
	    equivalent security with smaller key sizes than other
	    public key algorithms. Smaller key sizes result in
	    savings for power, memory, bandwidth, and computational
	    cost that make ECC especially attractive for constrained
	    environments.</p>

            The erlang ssh server has presented itself incorrectly,
            using the special version ssh-1.99, although it never has
            supported versions below 2.0. Since ssh-1.1 client
            versions below 2.0 are correctly rejected instead of
            letting the server crash later on. Alas the problem with
            the presentation string was not discovered until after
            ssh.1.1 was released. Now the server will present itself
            as ssh-2.0.</p>

	in a raw on the same ssh connection (different channels

	New API module ssh_channel has been added. This is a
	behaviour to facilitate the implementation of ssh clients
	and plug in subsystems to the ssh daemon. Note that this
	slightly changes the options to the API function
	ssh:daemon/[1,2,3] deprecating all no longer documented
	options. Note that the new API enforces the "logical way"
	of using the old API i.e. making the subsystem process
	part of the ssh applications supervisor tree, so missuses
      of the old API are not compatible with the new API.</p>

            When restarting an ssh-system the expected return value

            ssh_connection_manager and a a ssh_cli option was added

            API.</p>

            The architecture of the ssh processes has been
            reconstructed to fit in a supervision tree as to become a
            real OTP application and benefit from this when starting
            and stopping.</p>
