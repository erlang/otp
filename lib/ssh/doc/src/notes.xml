            The erlang ssh server has presented itself incorrectly,
            using the special version ssh-1.99, although it never has
            supported versions below 2.0. Since ssh-1.1 client
            versions below 2.0 are correctly rejected instead of
            letting the server crash later on. Alas the problem with
            the presentation string was not discovered until after
            ssh.1.1 was released. Now the server will present itself
            as ssh-2.0.</p>

	A flaw in the implementation of the supervision tree
	caused the ssh daemon to close the connections to all
	currently logged in users if one user logged out. Another
	problem related to the supervision tree caused the closing
	down of clients to leak processes e.i. all processes was
      not shutdown correctly.</p>

	Ssh incorrectly sent the local id instead of the remote
	id of a channel to the peer. For simpler cases these ids
	often happen to have the same value. One case when they
	do not is when the client sends an exec command two times
	in a raw on the same ssh connection (different channels
	of course as the channel will be closed when the exec
      command has been evaluated) .</p>

	New API module ssh_channel has been added. This is a
	behaviour to facilitate the implementation of ssh clients
	and plug in subsystems to the ssh daemon. Note that this
	slightly changes the options to the API function
	ssh:daemon/[1,2,3] deprecating all no longer documented
	options. Note that the new API enforces the "logical way"
	of using the old API e.i. making the subsystem process
	part of the ssh applications supervisor tree, so missuses
      of the old API are not compatible with the new API.</p>
