            The erlang ssh server has presented itself incorrectly,
            using the special version ssh-1.99, although it never has
            supported versions below 2.0. Since ssh-1.1 client
            versions below 2.0 are correctly rejected instead of
            letting the server crash later on. Alas the problem with
            the presentation string was not discovered until after
            ssh.1.1 was released. Now the server will present itself
            as ssh-2.0.</p>

            caused problem when the old listen API was used. This was
            introduced in Ssh-1.1.</p>

            Ssh timeouts will now behave as expected e.i. defaults to
            infinity only the user of the ssh application can know of
            a reasonable timeout value for their application.</p>

            To honor the multiplexing of channels over one ssh
            connection concept ssh_sftp:connect/ [1,2,3] is
            deprecated and replaced by ssh_sftp:start_channel/[1,2,3]
            and ssh_sftp:stop/1 is deprecated and replaced by
            ssh_sftp:stop_channel/1 and to stop the ssh connection
            ssh:close/ 1 should be called.</p>

            ConnectionManager} that shall be handled by the channel
            callback handle_msg/2. This makes the function
            handle_msg/2 a mandatory function for ssh channels
            implementations which it was not in ssh-1.1.</p>

	A flaw in the implementation of the supervision tree
	caused the ssh daemon to close the connections to all
	currently logged in users if one user logged out. Another
	problem related to the supervision tree caused the closing
	down of clients to leak processes e.i. all processes was
      not shutdown correctly.</p>

      almost never correct, at least on unix-based platforms.</p>

	Ssh incorrectly sent the local id instead of the remote
	id of a channel to the peer. For simpler cases these ids
	often happen to have the same value. One case when they
	do not is when the client sends an exec command two times
	in a raw on the same ssh connection (different channels
	of course as the channel will be closed when the exec
      command has been evaluated) .</p>

	New API module ssh_channel has been added. This is a
	behaviour to facilitate the implementation of ssh clients
	and plug in subsystems to the ssh daemon. Note that this
	slightly changes the options to the API function
	ssh:daemon/[1,2,3] deprecating all no longer documented
	options. Note that the new API enforces the "logical way"
	of using the old API e.i. making the subsystem process
	part of the ssh applications supervisor tree, so missuses
      of the old API are not compatible with the new API.</p>
