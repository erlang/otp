# SSH Application

The ssh application implements the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol and provides an
SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) client and server.

## Description

The `ssh` application is an implementation of the SSH protocol in Erlang. `ssh`
offers API functions to write customized SSH clients and servers as well as
making the Erlang shell available over SSH. An SFTP client, `ssh_sftp`, and
server, `ssh_sftpd`, are also included.

## Dependencies

The `ssh` application uses the applications `m:public_key` and `m:crypto` to
handle public keys and encryption. Hence, these applications must be loaded for
the `ssh` application to work. The call `ssh:start/0` will do the necessary
calls to [application:start/1,2](`application:start/1`) before it starts the
`ssh` itself.

## Configuration

The SSH application uses Configuration Parameters. Where to set them are
described in [config User's Guide](`e:kernel:config.md`) with SSH details in
[Configuration in SSH](configurations.md).

Some special configuration files from OpenSSH are also used:

- `known_hosts`
- `authorized_keys`
- `authorized_keys2`
- `id_dsa` _(supported but disabled by default)_
- `id_rsa` _(SHA1 sign/verify are supported but disabled by default from
  OTP-24)_
- `id_ecdsa`
- `id_ed25519`
- `id_ed448`
- `ssh_host_dsa_key` _(supported but disabled by default)_
- `ssh_host_rsa_key` _(SHA1 sign/verify are supported but disabled by default
  from OTP-24)_
- `ssh_host_ecdsa_key`
- `ssh_host_ed25519_key`
- `ssh_host_ed448_key`

By default, `ssh` looks for `id_*`, `known_hosts`, and `authorized_keys` in
`~/.ssh`, and for the ssh\_host\_\*\_key files in `/etc/ssh`. These locations can
be changed by the options [`user_dir`](`t:ssh_file:user_dir_common_option/0`)
and [`system_dir`](`t:ssh_file:system_dir_daemon_option/0`). More about where to
set them is described in [Configuration in SSH](configurations.md).

Public key handling can also be customized through a callback module that
implements the behaviors `m:ssh_client_key_api` and `m:ssh_server_key_api`.

See also the default callback module documentation in `m:ssh_file`.

Disabled public key algorithms can be enabled with the
[preferred_algorithms](`t:ssh:preferred_algorithms_common_option/0`) or
[modify_algorithms](`t:ssh:modify_algorithms_common_option/0`) options. See
[Example 9](configure_algos.md#example-9) in
[Configuring algorithms in SSH](configure_algos.md) for a description.

## Public Keys

`id_*` are the users private key files. Notice that the public key is part of
the private key so the `ssh` application does not use the `id_*.pub` files.
These are for the user's convenience when it is needed to convey the user's
public key.

See [ssh_file](`m:ssh_file#FILE-id_STAR`) for details.

## Known Hosts

The `known_hosts` file contains a list of approved servers and their public
keys. Once a server is listed, it can be verified without user interaction.

See [ssh_file](`m:ssh_file#FILE-known_hosts`) for details.

## Authorized Keys

The `authorized_key` file keeps track of the user's authorized public keys. The
most common use of this file is to let users log in without entering their
password, which is supported by the Erlang `ssh` daemon.

See [ssh_file](`m:ssh_file#FILE-authorized_keys`) for details.

## Host Keys

RSA, DSA (if enabled), ECDSA, ED25519 and ED448 host keys are supported and are
expected to be found in files named `ssh_host_rsa_key`, `ssh_host_dsa_key`,
`ssh_host_ecdsa_key`, `ssh_host_ed25519_key` and `ssh_host_ed448_key`.

See [ssh_file](`m:ssh_file#FILE-ssh_host_STAR_key`) for details.

## Logging

The `ssh` application uses the default [logger](`m:logger`) to
log unexpected errors or print information about special events.

[](){: #supported }

## Supported Specifications and Standards

The supported SSH version is 2.0.

## Algorithms

The actual set of algorithms may vary depending on which OpenSSL crypto library
that is installed on the machine. For the list on a particular installation, use
the command `ssh:default_algorithms/0`. The user may override the default
algorithm configuration both on the server side and the client side. See the
options [preferred_algorithms](`t:ssh:preferred_algorithms_common_option/0`) and
[modify_algorithms](`t:ssh:modify_algorithms_common_option/0`) in the
[ssh:daemon/1,2,3](`ssh:daemon/1`) and [ssh:connect/3,4](`ssh:connect/3`)
functions.

Supported algorithms are (in the default order):

## Unicode support

Unicode filenames are supported if the emulator and the underlying OS supports
it. See `m:file` manual page in Kernel for
information about this subject.

The shell and the cli both support unicode.

  [](){: #rfc5647_note } There is an ambiguity in the synchronized selection of
  cipher and mac algorithm. This is resolved by OpenSSH in the ciphers
  aes128-gcm@openssh.com and aes256-gcm@openssh.com which are implemented. If
  the explicit ciphers and macs AEAD_AES_128_GCM or AEAD_AES_256_GCM are needed,
  they could be enabled with the options
  [preferred_algorithms](`t:ssh:preferred_algorithms_common_option/0`) or
  [modify_algorithms](`t:ssh:modify_algorithms_common_option/0`).

  > #### Warning {: .warning }
  >
  > If the client or the server is not Erlang/OTP, it is the users
  > responsibility to check that other implementation has the same
  > interpretation of AEAD\_AES\_\*\_GCM as the Erlang/OTP SSH before enabling
  > them. The aes\*-gcm@openssh.com variants are always safe to use since they
  > lack the ambiguity.

  The second paragraph in section 5.1 is resolved as:

  1. If the negotiated cipher is AEAD_AES_128_GCM, the mac algorithm is set to
     AEAD_AES_128_GCM.
  1. If the negotiated cipher is AEAD_AES_256_GCM, the mac algorithm is set to
     AEAD_AES_256_GCM.
  1. If the mac algorithm is AEAD_AES_128_GCM, the cipher is set to
     AEAD_AES_128_GCM.
  1. If the mac algorithm is AEAD_AES_256_GCM, the cipher is set to
     AEAD_AES_256_GCM.
