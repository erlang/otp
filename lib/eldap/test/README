This works for me on Ubuntu.

To run thoose test you need
   1) some certificates
   2) a running ldap server, for example OpenLDAPs slapd. See http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin24

1)-------
To generate certificates:
erl
> make_certs:all("/dev/null", "eldap_basic_SUITE_data/certs").

2)-------
To start slapd:
   sudo slapd -f $ERL_TOP/lib/eldap/test/ldap_server/slapd.conf -F /tmp/slapd/slapd.d -h "ldap://localhost:9876 ldaps://localhost:9877"

This will however not work, since slapd is guarded by apparmor that checks that slapd does not access other than allowed files...

To make a local extension of allowed operations:
    sudo emacs /etc/apparmor.d/local/usr.sbin.slapd

and, after the change (yes, at least on Ubuntu it is right to edit ../local/.. but run with another file):

    sudo apparmor_parser -r /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.slapd


The local file looks like this for me:

# Site-specific additions and overrides for usr.sbin.slapd.
# For more details, please see /etc/apparmor.d/local/README.

/etc/pkcs11/** r,
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/** rm,

/ldisk/hans_otp/otp/lib/eldap/test/** rw,
/tmp/slapd/** rwk,
