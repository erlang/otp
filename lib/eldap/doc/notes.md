## Eldap 1.2.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- If the underlying tcp connection is closed and an LDAP operation returned
  tcp_error, the client applications tend to close the ldap handle with
  eldap:close. This will cause a `{nocatch, {gen_tcp_error, ...}}` exception.

  Such errors are now ignored during close, because the socket will be closed
  anyway.
