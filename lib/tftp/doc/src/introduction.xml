    <title>Purpose</title>
    <p>The Trivial File Transfer Protocol or TFTP is a very simple protocol
    used to transfer files.</p>
    <p>It has been implemented on top of the User Datagram protocol (UDP) so
    it may be used to move files between machines on different networks
    implementing UDP. It is designed to be small and easy to implement.
    Therefore, it lacks most of the features of a regular FTP.  The only
    thing it can do is read and write files (or mail) from/to a remote server.
    It cannot list directories, and currently has no provisions for user
    authentication.</p>
    <p>The <c>tftp</c> application implements the following IETF standards:</p>
    <list type="bulleted">
      <item>RFC 1350, The TFTP Protocol (revision 2)</item>
      <item>RFC 2347, TFTP Option Extension</item>
      <item>RFC 2348, TFTP Blocksize Option</item>
      <item>RFC 2349, TFTP Timeout Interval and Transfer Size Options</item>
    </list>
    <p>The only feature that not is implemented is the <c>netascii</c> transfer mode.</p>

    <title>Prerequisites</title>
    <p>It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the Erlang
      programming language, concepts of OTP, and has a basic
      understanding of the TFTP protocol.</p>
