	    <p> The implementation has been fixed to use

	    of <c>proc_lib:init_ack/1,2</c>. </p>

          <p>
	    Replace size/1 with either tuple_size/1 or byte_size/1</p>
          <p>
	    The <c>size/1</c> BIF is not optimized by the JIT, and
	    its use can result in worse types for Dialyzer.</p>
          <p>
	    When one knows that the value being tested must be a
	    tuple, <c>tuple_size/1</c> should always be preferred.</p>
          <p>
	    When one knows that the value being tested must be a
	    binary, <c>byte_size/1</c> should be preferred. However,
	    <c>byte_size/1</c> also accepts a bitstring (rounding up
	    size to a whole number of bytes), so one must make sure
	    that the call to <c>byte_size/</c> is preceded by a call
	    to <c>is_binary/1</c> to ensure that bitstrings are
	    rejected. Note that the compiler removes redundant calls
	    to <c>is_binary/1</c>, so if one is not sure whether
	    previous code had made sure that the argument is a
	    binary, it does not harm to add an <c>is_binary/1</c>
	    test immediately before the call to <c>byte_size/1</c>.</p>
