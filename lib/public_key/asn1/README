The files

	PKIX1Algorithms88.asn1
	PKIX1Explicit88.asn1
	PKIX1Implicit88.asn1
	PKIXAttributeCertificate.asn1

are from RFCs 3279, 3280 and 3281.

We have edited PKIX1Explicit88.asn1, PKIX1Implicit88.asn1, and 
PKIXAttributeCertificate.asn1 as follows:


1. Removal of definition of UniversalString and BMPString:

diff -r1.1 PKIX1Explicit88.asn1
15c15
< UniversalString ::= [UNIVERSAL 28] IMPLICIT OCTET STRING
---
> -- UniversalString ::= [UNIVERSAL 28] IMPLICIT OCTET STRING
18c18
< BMPString ::= [UNIVERSAL 30] IMPLICIT OCTET STRING
---
> -- BMPString ::= [UNIVERSAL 30] IMPLICIT OCTET STRING


2. Removal of definition of BMPString:

diff -r1.1 PKIX1Implicit88.asn1
13c13,14
<       BMPString, UTF8String,  -- end "new" types --
---
>       -- BMPString, 
>       UTF8String,  -- end "new" types --


3. Addition of definition of UTF8String, and correction of a typo.

diff -r1.1 PKIXAttributeCertificate.asn1
46c46
<              -- UTF8String ::= [UNIVERSAL 12] IMPLICIT OCTET STRING
---
>              UTF8String ::= [UNIVERSAL 12] IMPLICIT OCTET STRING
55c55
<                 version        AttCertVersion  -- version is v2,
---
>                 version        AttCertVersion,  -- version is v2

4. Definitions of public keys from PKCS-1.asn1 present in
PKIX1Algorithms88.asn1 where removed as we take them directly from
PKCS-1.asn1

5. PKCS-8 and PKCS-10 pragmatic renamings

6. PKCS-7 workaround for missing extendedCertificate definition could fixed if need occurs.
