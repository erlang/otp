            The documentation is now built with open source tools
            (xsltproc and fop) that exists on most platforms. One
            visible change is that the frames are removed.</p>

            X509 certificate handling has been extended and improved
            as a result of more extensive testing of both the ssl
            and public_key application. Even more extensions of the
            certificate handling is yet to be implemented.</p>
