	    Add support for ISO oids 1.3.14.3.2.29 and 1.3.14.3.2.27
	    that are somtimes used instead of the PKCS defined oids
	    1.2.840.113549.1.1.5 and 1.2.840.10040.4.3. Add function
	    pkix_sign_types:/1 that translates oids to to algorithm
	    atoms ex:</p>
          <p>
	    > public_key:pkix_sign_types({1,3,14,3,2,29}). {sha,rsa}</p>

	    Integrate elliptic curve contribution from Andreas
	    Schultz </p>
          <p>
	    In order to be able to support elliptic curve cipher
	    suites in SSL/TLS, additions to handle elliptic curve
	    infrastructure has been added to public_key and crypto.</p>
          <p>
	    This also has resulted in a rewrite of the crypto API to
	    gain consistency and remove unnecessary overhead. All OTP
	    applications using crypto has been updated to use the new
	    API.</p>
          <p>
	    Impact: Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) offers
	    equivalent security with smaller key sizes than other
	    public key algorithms. Smaller key sizes result in
	    savings for power, memory, bandwidth, and computational
	    cost that make ECC especially attractive for constrained
	    environments.</p>

	    Changed ssh implementation to use the public_key
	    application for all public key handling. This is also a
	    first step for enabling a callback API for supplying
	    public keys and handling keys protected with password
	    phrases. </p>
          <p>
	    Additionally the test suites where improved so that they
	    do not copy the users keys to test server directories as
	    this is a security liability. Also ipv6 and file access
	    issues found in the process has been fixed.</p>
          <p>
	    This change also solves OTP-7677 and OTP-7235</p>
          <p>
	    This changes also involves some updates to public_keys
	    ssh-functions.</p>

	    Better handling of v1 and v2 certificates. V1 and v2
	    certificates does not have any extensions so then

	    know when the peer certificate is reached otherwise.</p>
