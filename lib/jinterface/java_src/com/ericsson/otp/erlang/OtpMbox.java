/**
 * <p>
 * Provides a simple mechanism for exchanging messages with Erlang processes or
 * other instances of this class.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Each mailbox is associated with a unique {@link OtpErlangPid pid} that
 * contains information necessary for delivery of messages. When sending
 * messages to named processes or mailboxes, the sender pid is made available to
 * the recipient of the message. When sending messages to other mailboxes, the
 * recipient can only respond if the sender includes the pid as part of the
 * message contents. The sender can determine his own pid by calling
 * {@link #self self()}.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Mailboxes can be named, either at creation or later. Messages can be sent to
 * named mailboxes and named Erlang processes without knowing the
 * {@link OtpErlangPid pid} that identifies the mailbox. This is neccessary in
 * order to set up initial communication between parts of an application. Each
 * mailbox can have at most one name.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Since this class was intended for communication with Erlang, all of the send
 * methods take {@link OtpErlangObject OtpErlangObject} arguments. However this
 * class can also be used to transmit arbitrary Java objects (as long as they
 * implement one of java.io.Serializable or java.io.Externalizable) by
 * encapsulating the object in a {@link OtpErlangBinary OtpErlangBinary}.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Messages to remote nodes are externalized for transmission, and as a result
 * the recipient receives a <b>copy</b> of the original Java object. To ensure
 * consistent behaviour when messages are sent between local mailboxes, such
 * messages are cloned before delivery.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Additionally, mailboxes can be linked in much the same way as Erlang
 * processes. If a link is active when a mailbox is {@link #close closed}, any
 * linked Erlang processes or OtpMboxes will be sent an exit signal. As well,
 * exit signals will be (eventually) sent if a mailbox goes out of scope and its
 * {@link #finalize finalize()} method called. However due to the nature of
 * finalization (i.e. Java makes no guarantees about when {@link #finalize
 * finalize()} will be called) it is recommended that you always explicitly
 * close mailboxes if you are using links instead of relying on finalization to
 * notify other parties in a timely manner.
 * </p>
 * 
 * When retrieving messages from a mailbox that has received an exit signal, an
 * {@link OtpErlangExit OtpErlangExit} exception will be raised. Note that the
 * exception is queued in the mailbox along with other messages, and will not be
 * raised until it reaches the head of the queue and is about to be retrieved.
 * </p>
