/**
 * <p>
 * Provides a carrier for Erlang messages.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class are created to package header and payload information
 * in received Erlang messages so that the recipient can obtain both parts with
 * a single call to {@link OtpMbox#receiveMsg receiveMsg()}.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The header information that is available is as follows: <lu>
 * <li> a tag indicating the type of message
 * <li> the intended recipient of the message, either as a
 * {@link OtpErlangPid pid} or as a String, but never both.
 * <li> (sometimes) the sender of the message. Due to some eccentric
 * characteristics of the Erlang distribution protocol, not all messages have
 * information about the sending process. In particular, only messages whose tag
 * is {@link OtpMsg#regSendTag regSendTag} contain sender information. </lu>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Message are sent using the Erlang external format (see separate
 * documentation). When a message is received and delivered to the recipient
 * {@link OtpMbox mailbox}, the body of the message is still in this external
 * representation until {@link #getMsg getMsg()} is called, at which point the
 * message is decoded. A copy of the decoded message is stored in the OtpMsg so
 * that subsequent calls to {@link #getMsg getMsg()} do not require that the
 * message be decoded a second time.
 * </p>
