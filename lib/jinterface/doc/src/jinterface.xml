  <description>
    <p>Jinterface Java package contains java classes, which help you
      integrate programs written in Java with Erlang. The reference 
      documentation is available only on the web in Javadoc format.</p>
    <note>
      <p>By default, the <c>jinterface</c> library is only guaranteed
        to be compatible with other Erlang/OTP components from the same
        release as the <c>jinterface</c> library itself. See the documentation
        of the <c>OtpCompatRel</c> property in the Java API documentation.</p>
