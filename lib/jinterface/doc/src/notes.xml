	    Reformat the sources for JInterface uniformly and
	    according to the standard Java style guidelines. Provide
	    description of the rules applied in Eclipse format (for
	    other editors one can check the settings against these).</p>
          <p>
	    In short, the formatting style is: * indentation uses
	    only spaces; each level is 4 positions * no trailing
	    whitespace * mostly default Java style formatting (any
	    difference is minor) * always use {} blocks * use 'final'
	    as much as possible</p>

	    Java 1.5 has a bug where detecting codepoint offsets in
	    strings that are created by String.substring() gives
	    wrong results. The new implementation uses a different

	    JInterface: improve OtpOutputStream buffer allocation</p>
          <p>
	    Previously, the buffer was increased linearly by 2048
	    bytes. I now propose to use an exponential increase
	    function (similar to Javas ArrayList, e.g. always at
	    least +50%). This significantly increases performance of
	    e.g. doRPC for large parameters. (Thanks to Nico Kruber)</p>

	    <p>The documentation is now possible to build in an open
	    source environment after a number of bugs are fixed and
	    some features are added in the documentation build
	    process. </p>
	    <p>- The arity calculation is updated.</p>
	    <p>- The module prefix used in the function names for
	    bif's are removed in the generated links so the links
	    will look like
	    "http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#append_element-2"
	    instead of
	    "http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#erlang:append_element-2".</p>
	    <p>- Enhanced the menu positioning in the html
	    documentation when a new page is loaded.</p>
	    <p>- A number of corrections in the generation of man
	    pages (thanks to Sergei Golovan)</p>
	    <p>- The legal notice is taken from the xml book file so
	    OTP's build process can be used for non OTP

	    Many Erlang classes, e.g. OtpErlangRef, was missing an
	    implementation of the hashCode() method, making it futile
	    to put them in hash structures such as HashMap. Bug and
	    patch provided by Paul Guyot. We extended the patch to
	    all classes and improved (?) on the hash algorithm.</p>

          <p>
	    A number of fixes and improvements from the ErlIDE group;
	    Vlad Dumitrescu and Jakob Cederlund: JDK 1.5 is now a
	    minimal requirement for building Jinterface. New method:
	    OtpEpmd.lookupNames. OtpErlangList is now iterable.
	    Non-proper lists are now allowed - you have to test if a
	    list is proper or not. Non-proper lists can also be
	    created. New methods: isProper, getHead, getTail and
	    getNthTail. The get tail methods creates a sublist object
	    that re-uses the original list. OtpErlangPid is now
	    Comparable. Empty atoms can now be constructed, a missing
	    feature pointed out by Sebastien Boisgerault on
	    erlang-questions.</p>

	    Jinterface has been fixed to use the loopback interface
	    when connecting to the Erlang Port Mapper Daemon - epmd.
	    This facilitates firewall configuration and saves

	    <p>Jinterface now refuses to connect to another node that
	    does not agree on the other node's name. This has been a
	    problem in that a connection was set up, but not used on
	    a following send, which caused a second erroneous
	    connection attempt to fail since the other (Erlang) node
	    rejects a connection due to name disagreement.</p>

	    <p>Jinterface has been updated to handle compressed
	    terms, bitstring, new (IEEE) floats and bignums. This has
	    caused a few incompatibilities.</p>
	    <p>com.ericsson.otp.erlang.OtpOutputStream now extends
	    java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream, previously
	    java.lang.Object, and hence the method size() now return
	    the number of bytes in the stream as dictated by the new
	    parent class and not the buffer length as before. The new
	    method length() returns what the old size() did return.
	    The method count() is deprecated as it returns the same
	    as the new size().</p>
	    <p>com.ericsson.otp.erlang.OtpErlangLong now can handle
	    larger values than 64-bit. Previously when larger than
	    64-bit integers were sent to a Jinterface node, it caused
	    an com.ericsson.otp.erlang.OtpDecodeException. Now the
	    integer is accepted, but the return value of longValue()
	    is silently truncated, as opposed to the return value of
	    intValue() that now and previously raises an
	    com.ericsson.otp.erlang.OtpRangeException for
	    unrepresentable values. The new methods isLong() and
	    isULong() can be used to determine if the value fits in a
	    long.</p>

          <p>Process identifiers and port identifiers have been
            made more unique. Previously 18 bits were used as id in
            the internal representation of process and port
            identifiers. Now 28 bits are used. </p>
          <p>The maximum
            limit on the number of concurrently existing processes
            due to the representation of pids has been increased to
            268435456 processes. The same is true for ports. This
            limit will at least on a 32-bit architecture be
            impossible to reach due to memory shortage. </p>
          <p><em>NOTE:</em> By default, the <c>ERTS</c>, and the
            <c>erl_interface</c>, <c>ei</c>, and <c>jinterface</c>
            libraries are now only guaranteed to be compatible with
            other Erlang/OTP components from the same release. It is
            possible to set each component in compatibility mode of
            an earlier release, though. See the documentation for
            respective component on how to set it in compatibility
            mode. </p>

          <p>Output of Java long was truncated to 32 bits. IDL long
            long and unsigned long long could not be used in a struct
            for the Java backend. All unsigned integer types for the
            Java backend had broken marshalling for large values.
            These bugs has now been fixed.</p>
