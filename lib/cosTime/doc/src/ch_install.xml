    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Configuration</title>
      <p>When using both the Time and TimerEvent Services the <c>cosTime</c> application 
        first must be installed using <c>cosTime:install_time()</c> and
        <c>cosTime:install_timerevent()</c>, followed by <c>cosTime:start()</c>.
        Now we can choose which can start the servers by using 
        <c>cosTime:start_time_service(Tdf, Inaccuracy)</c> 
        and <c>cosTime:start_timerevent_service(TimeService)</c>.</p>
