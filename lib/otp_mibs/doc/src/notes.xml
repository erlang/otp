          <p>
	    Tuple funs (a two-element tuple with a module name and a
	    function) are now officially deprecated and will be
	    removed in R16. Use '<c>fun M:F/A</c>' instead. To make
	    you aware that your system uses tuple funs, the very
	    first time a tuple fun is applied, a warning will be sent
	    to the error logger.</p>

    <title>OTP_Mibs 1.0</title>
    <p>The OTP mibs that where included in the SASL application
      have been moved to this new application OTP_Mibs. The OTP
      mibs had no real connection to SASL and it is desirable that
      the core of Erlang/OTP is not dependent on SNMP.</p>
