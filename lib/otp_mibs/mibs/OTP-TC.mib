    STATUS       current
    DESCRIPTION
        "An OwnerString identifies the initiator or owner of a row
        in a table. This label is set by the initiator to provide
        for the following possibilities:

            o A management station may recognize resources it owns
              and no longer needs.
            o A network operator can find the management station that
              owns the resource and negotiate for it to be freed.
            o A network operator may decide to unilaterally free
              resources another network operator has reserved.
            o Upon initialization, a management station may recognize
              resources it had reserved in the past.  With this
              information it may free the resources if it no longer
              needs them.

        Management stations and agent systems should support any format
        of the OwnerString dictated by the local policy of the
        organization.  It is suggested that this name contain one or
        more of the following: IP address, management station name,
        network manager's name, location, or phone number.  This
        information will help users to share the resources more
        effectively.

        There is often default functionality that the device or the
        administrator of the agent (often the network administrator) wishes
        to set up.  The resources associated with this functionality are then
        owned by the device itself or by the network administrator, and are
        intended to be long-lived.  In this case, the device or the
        administrator will set the relevant owner object to a string starting
        with 'local'.  Indiscriminate modification of the local
        configuration by network management stations is discouraged.  In
        fact, a network management station should only modify these objects
        under the direction of the administrator of the agent system."
