	    Erlang/OTP has been ported to the realtime operating
	    system OSE. The port supports both smp and non-smp
	    emulator. For details around the port and how to started
	    see the User's Guide in the <seealso
	    marker="ose:ose_intro">ose</seealso> application. </p>
          <p>
	    Note that not all parts of Erlang/OTP has been ported. </p>
          <p>
	    Notable things that work are: non-smp and smp emulators,
	    OSE signal interaction, crypto, asn1, run_erl/to_erl,
	    tcp, epmd, distribution and most if not all non-os
	    specific functionality of Erlang.</p>
          <p>
	    Notable things that does not work are: udp/sctp, os_mon,
	    erl_interface, binding of schedulers.</p>
