    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>The main way which programs on Enea OSE interact is through the
    usage of message passing, much the same way as Erlang processes
    communicate. There are two ways in which an Erlang programmer can
    interact with the signals sent from other Enea OSE processes; either
    through the provided <c>ose</c> module, or by writing a custom linked-in
    driver. This User's Guide describes and provides examples for both
    approaches.

    <title>Signals in Erlang</title>
    <p>Erlang/OTP on OSE provides a erlang module called
    <seealso marker="ose:ose">ose</seealso> that can be used to interact
    with other OSE processes using message passing. The api in the module
    is very similar to the native OSE api, so for details of how the
    functions work please refer to the official OSE documenation. Below
    is an example usage of the API.
    </p>
    <code>1> P1 = ose:open("p1").
#Port&gt;0.344>
2> ose:hunt(P1,"p2").
{#Port&gt;0.344>,1}
3> P2 = ose:open("p2").
#Port&gt;0.355>
4> flush().
Shell got {mailbox_up,#Port&gt;0.344>,{#Port&gt;0.344>,1},852189}
ok
5> ose:listen(P1,[1234]).
ok
6> ose:send(P2,ose:get_id(P1),1234,&gt;&gt;"hello">>).
ok
7> flush().
Shell got {message,#Port&gt;0.344>,{852189,1245316,1234,&gt;&gt;"hello">>}}
ok</code>

    <title>Signals in a Linked-in driver</title>
    <p>
      Writing Linked-in drivers for OSE is very similar to how it is done
      for Unix/Windows. It is only the way in which the driver subscribes
      and consumed external events that is different. In Unix (and Windows)
      file descriptiors (and Event Objects) are used to select on. On OSE
      we use signals to deliver the same functionality. There are two large
      differences between a signal and an fd.
    </p>
    <p>
      In OSE it is not possible for a signal number to be a unique identifier
      for a resource in the same way as an fd is. For example; let's say we
      implement a driver that does an asynchronous hunt that uses signal
      number 1234 as the hunt_sig. If we want to be able to have multiple
      hunt ports running at the same time we have to have someway of routing
      the signal to the correct port. This is achieved by supplying a secondary
      id that can be retrieved through the meta-data or payload of the signal,
      e.g:
      <code>ErlDrvEvent event = erl_drv_ose_event_alloc(1234,port,resolver);</code>
      The event you get back from
      <seealso marker="ose_erl_driver#erl_drv_ose_event_alloc">
      erl_drv_ose_event_alloc</seealso> can then be used by
      <seealso marker="erts:erl_driver#driver_select">driver_select</seealso>
      to subscribe to signals. The first argument is just the signal number
      that we are interested in. The second is the id that we choose to use,
      in this case the port id that we got in the
      <seealso marker="erts:driver_entry#start">start</seealso> callback is
      used. The third argument is a function pointer to a function that can
      be used to figure out the id from a given signal. The fourth argument can
      point to any additional data you might want to associate with the event.
      There is a complete. You can examine the data contained in the event with
      <seealso marker="ose_erl_driver#erl_drv_ose_event_fetch">erl_drv_ose_event_fetch</seealso>
      , eg:
      <code>erl_drv_ose_event_fetch(event, &amp;signal, &amp;port, (void **)&amp;extra);</code>
      example of what this could look like in
      <seealso marker="#example">the next section</seealso>.
      <note>It is very important to issue the driver_select call before
      any of the signals you are interested in are sent. If driver_select
      is called after the signal is sent, there is a high probability that it
      will be lost.</note>
    </p>
    <p>
      The other difference from unix is that in OSE the payload of the event
      (i.e. the signal data) is already received when the ready_output/input
      callbacks are called. This means that you access the data of a signal
      by calling <seealso marker="ose_erl_driver#erl_drv_ose_get_signal">
      erl_drv_ose_get_signal</seealso>. Additionally multiple signals might be
      associated with the event, so you should call
      <seealso marker="ose_erl_driver#erl_drv_ose_get_signal">
      erl_drv_ose_get_signal</seealso> until <c>NULL</c> is returned.
