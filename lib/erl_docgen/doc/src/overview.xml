    <title>DTD Suite</title>

    <p>Input is written as XML according to one of the DTDs and output
      is corresponding HTML. Documentation for an Erlang/OTP application
      is usually organized as follows:</p>
    <taglist>
      <tag><em>User's Guide</em></tag>
      <item>
	<p>(DTD:
	  <seealso marker="user_guide_dtds#partDTD">part</seealso>)
	  A collection of chapters
	  (<seealso marker="user_guide_dtds#chapterDTD">chapter</seealso>).
	</p>
      </item>

      <tag><em>Reference Manual</em></tag>
      <item>
	<p>(DTD:
	  <seealso marker="refman_dtds#applicationDTD">application</seealso>
	  A collection of manual pages for modules
	  (<seealso marker="refman_dtds#erlrefDTD">erlref</seealso>),
	  applications
	  (<seealso marker="refman_dtds#apprefDTD">appref</seealso>),
	  commands
	  (<seealso marker="refman_dtds#comrefDTD">comref</seealso>),
	  C libraries
	  (<seealso marker="refman_dtds#crefDTD">cref</seealso>) and
	  files
	  (<seealso marker="refman_dtds#filerefDTD">fileref</seealso>).
	</p>
      </item>

      <tag><em>Release Notes</em></tag>
      <item>
	<p>Same structure as the User's Guide.</p>
      </item>
    </taglist>

    <p>In some cases, one or more of the User's Guide, Reference Manual
      and Release Notes are omitted. Also, it is possible to use either
      the <c>application</c> or <c>part</c> DTD to write other types
      of documentation for the application.</p>

  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Structure of Generated HTML</title>

    <p>The generated HTML corresponding to a <c>part</c> or
      <c>application</c> document is split into a left frame and a right
      frame. The left frame contains information about the document
      and links to the included files, that is chapters or manual pages.
      The right frame is used to display either the front page for
      the document, or the selected chapter/manual page.</p>

    <p>The left frame also contains links to a bibliography and a
      glossary, which are automatically generated.</p>

    <p>In the case of an <c>application</c> document, the left frame
      also contains a link to an automatically generated index.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Basic Tags</title>

    <p>All DTDs in the OTP DTD suite share a basic set of tags.
      An author can easily switch from one DTD to another and still use
      the same basic tags. It is furthermore easy to copy pieces of
      information from one document to another, even though they do not
      use the same DTD.</p>

    <p>The basic set of tags are divided into two categories:
      <seealso marker="block_tags">block tags</seealso> and
      <seealso marker="inline_tags">inline tags</seealso>. Block tags
      typically define a separate block of information, like a
      paragraph or a list. Inline tags are typically used within block
      tags, for example a highlighted word within a paragraph.</p>

  <section>
    <title>About This Document</title>

    <p>In this User's Guide, the structure of the different documents
      and the meaning of the tags are explained. There are numerous
      examples of documentation source code.</p>

    <p>For readability and simplicity, the examples have been kept as
      short as possible. For an example of what the generated HTML
      will look like, it is recommended to look at the documentation of 
      an OTP application.</p>
    <list>
      <item>This User's Guides are written using the <c>part</c> and
	<c>chapter</c> DTDs.</item>

      <item>The Reference Manuals are written using
	the <c>application</c>, <c>appref</c> and <c>erlref</c> DTDs.

      <item>
	<p>Create the relevant XML files.</p>

	<p>If there are EDoc comments in a module, the escript 
	  <!-- seealso marker="xml_from_edoc">xml_from_edoc</seealso -->
          <c>xml_from_edoc</c>
	  can be used to generate an XML file according to
	  the <c>erlref</c> DTD for this module.</p>
      </item>

      <!-- item>
	<p>The XML files can be validated using
	  <seealso marker="docb_xml_check#validate/1">docb_xml_check:validate/1</seealso>.
