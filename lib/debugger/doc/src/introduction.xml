    <title>Scope</title>
    <p>Debugger is a graphical user interface for the Erlang
      interpreter, which can be used for debugging and testing of
      Erlang programs. For example, breakpoints can be set, code can be
      single-stepped and variable values can be displayed and changed.
    </p>

    <p>The Erlang interpreter can also be accessed through the interface
      module <seealso marker="int"><c>int(3)</c></seealso>.
    </p>

    <warning>
      <p>Debugger might at some point
      start tracing on the processes that execute the interpreted
      code. This means that a conflict occurs if tracing by other
      means is started on any of these processes.</p>
    </warning>

  <section>
    <title>Prerequisites</title>
    <p>It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the Erlang
      programming language.</p>
    <p>Modules to be debugged must include debug information,
      for example, <c>erlc +debug_info MODULE.erl</c>.</p>
