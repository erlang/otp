This is a short description on the use of the java demo,
a client that initiates and uses a random number generator
that lies on a java-server. You will be able to shift the 
existing client/server with the ones refered to the other
examples.

Instructions.

1) Start erlang 
 
    On the erlang shell type :
    --------------------------

    ic:gen(random,[{be,java}]).     ( generates the java code )


2) Modify the "SNode" string on file "server.java" to the server
   node name thet suites for your machine.


3) Modify the "SNode" string on file "client.java" to the client 
   node for your machine and the "PNode" string for the server
   node ( = the same as the SNode for the "server.java" file ).


4) Set and export the CLASSPATH variable to point to the
   java classes located in java development kit, the
   Otp's classes and the current directory.
   Your classpath should look like this :

   .:<OTPROOT>/lib/ic-4.0/priv/ic.jar:<OTPROOT>/lib/jinterface_1.1/priv/OtpErlang.jar

   where :

    <OTPROOT> is the location there OTP is installed


5) Start the empd deamon by using the command :
   
    epmd -daemon


6) Compile the generated java code :

    javac rmod/*.java                   ( compiles all generated java code )

    javac *.java                        ( compiles all manually written java code )


7)  Start the java on an terminal window :

    java server                         ( starts the java-server )


8)  Start the client on an terminal window :

    java client                         ( calls the server )
