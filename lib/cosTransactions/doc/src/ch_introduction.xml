    <title>Overview</title>
    <p>The cosTransactions application is a Transaction Service compliant with the <url href="http://www.omg.org">OMG</url> 
      Transaction Service CosTransactions 1.1.
      </p>

    <section>
      <title>Purpose and Dependencies</title>
      <p><em>cosTransactions</em> is dependent on  <em>Orber version 3.0.1</em> or later(see the Orber
        documentation), which provides CORBA functionality in an Erlang environment.</p>
      <p><em>cosTransactions</em> is dependent on  <em>supervisor/stdlib-1.7</em> or later.</p>
      <p>Basically, cosTransaction implements a <em>two-phase commit protocol</em> and allows objects running
        on different platforms to participate in a transaction.</p>

    <section>
      <title>Prerequisites</title>
      <p>To fully understand the concepts presented in the
        documentation, it is recommended that the user is familiar
        with distributed programming, CORBA and the Orber application.
        </p>
      <p>Recommended reading includes <em>CORBA, Fundamentals and Programming - Jon Siegel</em> and <em>Open Telecom Platform Documentation Set</em>. It is also helpful to  have read
        <em>Concurrent Programming in Erlang</em> and, for example, <em>Transaction Processing: concepts and techniques - Jim Gray, Andreas Reuter</em>.</p>
      <note>
        <p>The cosTransaction application is compliant with the OMG CosTransactions specification 1.1. Using
          other vendors transaction service, compliant with the OMG CosTransactions specification 1.0, may
          not work since the <c>'TRANSACTION_REQUIRED', 'TRANSACTION_ROLLEDBACK'</c> and <c>'INVALID_TRANSACTION'</c>
          exceptions have been redefined to be system exceptions, i.e., used to be transaction-specific ('CosTransactions_Exc').</p>
