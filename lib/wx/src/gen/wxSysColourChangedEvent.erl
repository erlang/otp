-module(wxSysColourChangedEvent).
-moduledoc """
This class is used for system colour change events, which are generated when the user
changes the colour settings using the control panel.

This is only appropriate under Windows.

Remark: The default event handler for this event propagates the event to child windows,
since Windows only sends the events to top-level windows. If intercepting this event for a
top-level window, remember to call the base class handler, or to pass the event on to the
window's children explicitly.

See: [Overview events](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/overview_events.html#overview_events)

This class is derived, and can use functions, from:

* `m:wxEvent`

wxWidgets docs: [wxSysColourChangedEvent](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/classwx_sys_colour_changed_event.html)

## Events

Use `wxEvtHandler:connect/3` with `wxSysColourChangedEventType` to subscribe to events of this type.
