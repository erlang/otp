<description><p>A memory device context provides a means to draw graphics onto a bitmap. When drawing in to a mono-bitmap, using <c>wxWHITE</c>, <c>wxWHITE_PEN</c> and <c>wxWHITE_BRUSH</c> will draw the background colour (i.e. 0) whereas all other colours will draw the foreground colour (i.e. 1).
      </p><p>A bitmap must be selected into the new memory DC before it may be used for anything. Typical usage is as follows:
      </p><p>Note that the memory DC must be deleted (or the bitmap selected out of it) before a bitmap can be reselected into another memory DC.
      </p><p>And, before performing any other operations on the bitmap data, the bitmap must be selected out of the memory DC:
      </p><p>This happens automatically when <seeerl marker="wxMemoryDC"><c>wxMemoryDC</c></seeerl> object goes out of scope.
      </p><p>See: <seeerl marker="wxBitmap"><c>wxBitmap</c></seeerl>, <seeerl marker="wxDC"><c>wxDC</c></seeerl>
      </p>
  <p>This class is derived (and can use functions) from: 
    <seeerl marker="wxDC"><c>wxDC</c></seeerl></p>

      </p><p>This constructor creates a memory device context <c>compatible</c> with <c>dc</c> in wxMSW, the argument is ignored in the other ports. If <c>dc</c> is NULL, a device context compatible with the screen is created, just as with the default constructor.

      </p><p>drawing on this DC.
      </p><p>Using <seemfa marker="#selectObjectAsSource/2"><c>selectObjectAsSource/2</c></seemfa> when modifying the bitmap may incur some problems related to <seeerl marker="wxBitmap"><c>wxBitmap</c></seeerl> being a reference counted object (see overview_refcount).
      </p><p>Before using the updated bitmap data, make sure to select it out of context first either by selecting ?wxNullBitmap into the device context or destroying the device context entirely.
      </p><p>If the bitmap is already selected in this device context, nothing is done. If it is selected in another context, the function asserts and drawing on the bitmap won't work correctly.

    <desc><p>Selects the given bitmap into the device context, to use as the memory bitmap. 
      </p><p>Selecting the bitmap into a memory DC allows you to draw into the DC (and therefore the bitmap) and also to use <seemfa marker="wxDC#blit/6"><c>wxDC:blit/6</c></seemfa> to copy the bitmap to a window. For this purpose, you may find <seemfa marker="wxDC#drawIcon/3"><c>wxDC:drawIcon/3</c></seemfa> easier to use instead.
      </p><p>If the argument is ?wxNullBitmap (or some other uninitialised <seeerl marker="wxBitmap"><c>wxBitmap</c></seeerl>) the current bitmap is selected out of the device context, and the original bitmap restored, allowing the current bitmap to be destroyed safely.
