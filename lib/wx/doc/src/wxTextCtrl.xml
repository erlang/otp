<modulesummary>Functions for wxTextCtrl class</modulesummary>
<description><p>A text control allows text to be displayed and edited.
      </p><p>It may be single line or multi-line. Notice that a lot of methods of the text controls are found in the base <c>wxTextEntry</c> (not implemented in wx) class which is a common base class for <seeerl marker="wxTextCtrl"><c>wxTextCtrl</c></seeerl> and other controls using a single line text entry field (e.g. <seeerl marker="wxComboBox"><c>wxComboBox</c></seeerl>).
      </p><p>Styles</p><p>This class supports the following styles:
      </p><p>wxTextCtrl Text Format</p> <p>The multiline text controls always store the text as a sequence of lines separated by <c>'\n'</c> characters, i.e. in the Unix text format even on non-Unix platforms. This allows the user code to ignore the differences between the platforms but at a price: the indices in the control such as those returned by <seemfa marker="#getInsertionPoint/1"><c>getInsertionPoint/1</c></seemfa> or <seemfa marker="#getSelection/1"><c>getSelection/1</c></seemfa> can <c>not</c> be used as indices into the string returned by <seemfa marker="#getValue/1"><c>getValue/1</c></seemfa> as they're going to be slightly off for platforms using <c>"\\r\\n"</c> as separator (as Windows does).
      </p> <p>Instead, if you need to obtain a substring between the 2 indices obtained from the control with the help of the functions mentioned above, you should use <seemfa marker="#getRange/3"><c>getRange/3</c></seemfa>. And the indices themselves can only be passed to other methods, for example <seemfa marker="#setInsertionPoint/2"><c>setInsertionPoint/2</c></seemfa> or <seemfa marker="#setSelection/3"><c>setSelection/3</c></seemfa>.
      </p> <p>To summarize: never use the indices returned by (multiline) <seeerl marker="wxTextCtrl"><c>wxTextCtrl</c></seeerl> as indices into the string it contains, but only as arguments to be passed back to the other <seeerl marker="wxTextCtrl"><c>wxTextCtrl</c></seeerl> methods. This problem doesn't arise for single-line platforms however where the indices in the control do correspond to the positions in the value string.
      </p><p>wxTextCtrl Positions and Coordinates</p> <p>It is possible to use either linear positions, i.e. roughly (but <c>not</c> always exactly, as explained in the previous section) the index of the character in the text contained in the control or X-Y coordinates, i.e. column and line of the character when working with this class and it provides the functions <seemfa marker="#positionToXY/2"><c>positionToXY/2</c></seemfa> and <seemfa marker="#xYToPosition/3"><c>xYToPosition/3</c></seemfa> to convert between the two.
      </p> <p>Additionally, a position in the control can be converted to its coordinates in pixels using <c>PositionToCoords()</c> (not implemented in wx) which can be useful to e.g. show a popup menu near the given character. And, in the other direction, <c>HitTest()</c> (not implemented in wx) can be used to find the character under, or near, the given pixel coordinates.
      </p> <p>To be more precise, positions actually refer to the gaps between characters and not the characters themselves. Thus, position 0 is the one before the very first character in the control and so is a valid position even when the control is empty. And if the control contains a single character, it has two valid positions: 0 before this character and 1 - after it. This, when the documentation of various functions mentions "invalid position", it doesn't consider the position just after the last character of the line to be invalid, only the positions beyond that one (e.g. 2 and greater in the single character example) are actually invalid.
      </p><p>wxTextCtrl Styles.</p> <p>Multi-line text controls support styling, i.e. provide a possibility to set colours and font for individual characters in it (note that under Windows <c>wxTE_RICH</c> style is required for style support). To use the styles you can either call <seemfa marker="#setDefaultStyle/2"><c>setDefaultStyle/2</c></seemfa> before inserting the text or call <seemfa marker="#setStyle/4"><c>setStyle/4</c></seemfa> later to change the style of the text already in the control (the first solution is much more efficient).
      </p> <p>In either case, if the style doesn't specify some of the attributes (for example you only want to set the text colour but without changing the font nor the text background), the values of the default style will be used for them. If there is no default style, the attributes of the text control itself are used.
      </p> <p>So the following code correctly describes what it does: the second call to <seemfa marker="#setDefaultStyle/2"><c>setDefaultStyle/2</c></seemfa> doesn't change the text foreground colour (which stays red) while the last one doesn't change the background colour (which stays grey):
      </p> <p>wxTextCtrl and C++ Streams</p> <p>This class multiply-inherits from <c>std::streambuf</c> (except for some really old compilers using non-standard iostream library), allowing code such as the following:
      </p>  <p>Note that even if your build of wxWidgets doesn't support this (the symbol <c>wxHAS_TEXT_WINDOW_STREAM</c> has value of 0 then) you can still use <seeerl marker="wxTextCtrl"><c>wxTextCtrl</c></seeerl> itself in a stream-like manner:
      </p>  <p>However the possibility to create a <c>std::ostream</c> associated with <seeerl marker="wxTextCtrl"><c>wxTextCtrl</c></seeerl> may be useful if you need to redirect the output of a function taking a <c>std::ostream</c> as parameter to a text control.
      </p> <p>Another commonly requested need is to redirect <c>std::cout</c> to the text control. This may be done in the following way:
      </p>  <p>But wxWidgets provides a convenient class to make it even simpler so instead you may just do
      </p>  <p>See <c>wxStreamToTextRedirector</c> (not implemented in wx) for more details.
      </p><p>Event Handling.</p> <p>The following commands are processed by default event handlers in <seeerl marker="wxTextCtrl"><c>wxTextCtrl</c></seeerl>: <c>wxID_CUT</c>, <c>wxID_COPY</c>, <c>wxID_PASTE</c>, <c>wxID_UNDO</c>, <c>wxID_REDO</c>. The associated UI update events are also processed automatically, when the control has the focus.

    <desc><p>Returns the insertion point, or cursor, position. 
      </p><p>This is defined as the zero based index of the character position to the right of the insertion point. For example, if the insertion point is at the end of the single-line text control, it is equal to <seemfa marker="#getLastPosition/1"><c>getLastPosition/1</c></seemfa>.
      </p><p>Notice that insertion position is, in general, different from the index of the character the cursor position at in the string returned by <seemfa marker="#getValue/1"><c>getValue/1</c></seemfa>. While this is always the case for the single line controls, multi-line controls can use two characters <c>"\\r\\n"</c> as line separator (this is notably the case under MSW) meaning that indices in the control and its string value are offset by 1 for every line.
      </p><p>Hence to correctly get the character at the current cursor position, taking into account that there can be none if the cursor is at the end of the string, you could do the following:

    <fsummary>Returns the number of lines in the text control buffer. </fsummary>
    <desc><p>Returns the number of lines in the text control buffer. 
      </p><p>The returned number is the number of logical lines, i.e. just the count of the number of newline characters in the control + 1, for wxGTK and wxOSX/Cocoa ports while it is the number of physical lines, i.e. the count of lines actually shown in the control, in wxMSW. Because of this discrepancy, it is not recommended to use this function.
      </p><p>Remark: Note that even empty text controls have one line (where the insertion point is), so <seemfa marker="#getNumberOfLines/1"><c>getNumberOfLines/1</c></seemfa> never returns 0.
