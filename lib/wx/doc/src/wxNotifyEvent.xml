<modulesummary>Functions for wxNotifyEvent class</modulesummary>
<description><p>This class is not used by the event handlers by itself, but is a base class for other event classes (such as <seeerl marker="wxBookCtrlEvent"><c>wxBookCtrlEvent</c></seeerl>).
      </p><p>It (or an object of a derived class) is sent when the controls state is being changed and allows the program to <seemfa marker="#veto/1"><c>veto/1</c></seemfa> this change if it wants to prevent it from happening.
      </p><p>See: <seeerl marker="wxBookCtrlEvent"><c>wxBookCtrlEvent</c></seeerl>
      </p>
  <p>This class is derived (and can use functions) from: 
    <seeerl marker="wxCommandEvent"><c>wxCommandEvent</c></seeerl> <seeerl marker="wxEvent"><c>wxEvent</c></seeerl></p>

      </p><p>For most events it is not necessary to call this method as the events are allowed anyhow but some are forbidden by default (this will be mentioned in the corresponding event description).

      </p><p>It is in general a good idea to notify the user about the reasons for vetoing the change because otherwise the applications behaviour (which just refuses to do what the user wants) might be quite surprising.
