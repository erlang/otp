<description><p>A <seeerl marker="wxDC"><c>wxDC</c></seeerl> is a <c>"device context"</c> onto which graphics and text can be drawn. It is intended to represent different output devices and offers a common abstract API for drawing on any of them.
      </p><p>wxWidgets offers an alternative drawing API based on the modern drawing backends GDI+, CoreGraphics, Cairo and Direct2D. See <seeerl marker="wxGraphicsContext"><c>wxGraphicsContext</c></seeerl>, <seeerl marker="wxGraphicsRenderer"><c>wxGraphicsRenderer</c></seeerl> and related classes. There is also a <seeerl marker="wxGCDC"><c>wxGCDC</c></seeerl> linking the APIs by offering the <seeerl marker="wxDC"><c>wxDC</c></seeerl> API on top of a <seeerl marker="wxGraphicsContext"><c>wxGraphicsContext</c></seeerl>.
      </p><p><seeerl marker="wxDC"><c>wxDC</c></seeerl> is an abstract base class and cannot be created directly. Use <seeerl marker="wxPaintDC"><c>wxPaintDC</c></seeerl>, <seeerl marker="wxClientDC"><c>wxClientDC</c></seeerl>, <seeerl marker="wxWindowDC"><c>wxWindowDC</c></seeerl>, <seeerl marker="wxScreenDC"><c>wxScreenDC</c></seeerl>, <seeerl marker="wxMemoryDC"><c>wxMemoryDC</c></seeerl> or <c>wxPrinterDC</c> (not implemented in wx). Notice that device contexts which are associated with windows (i.e. <seeerl marker="wxClientDC"><c>wxClientDC</c></seeerl>, <seeerl marker="wxWindowDC"><c>wxWindowDC</c></seeerl> and <seeerl marker="wxPaintDC"><c>wxPaintDC</c></seeerl>) use the window font and colours by default (starting with wxWidgets 2.9.0) but the other device context classes use system-default values so you always must set the appropriate fonts and colours before using them.
      </p><p>In addition to the versions of the methods documented below, there are also versions which accept single {X,Y} parameter instead of the two wxCoord ones or {X,Y} and {Width,Height} instead of the four wxCoord parameters.
      </p><p>Beginning with wxWidgets 2.9.0 the entire <seeerl marker="wxDC"><c>wxDC</c></seeerl> code has been reorganized. All platform dependent code (actually all drawing code) has been moved into backend classes which derive from a common wxDCImpl class. The user-visible classes such as <seeerl marker="wxClientDC"><c>wxClientDC</c></seeerl> and <seeerl marker="wxPaintDC"><c>wxPaintDC</c></seeerl> merely forward all calls to the backend implementation.
      </p><p>Device and logical units</p> <p>In the <seeerl marker="wxDC"><c>wxDC</c></seeerl> context there is a distinction between <c>logical</c> units and <c>device</c> units.
      </p> <p><c>Device</c> units are the units native to the particular device; e.g. for a screen, a device unit is a <c>pixel</c>. For a printer, the device unit is defined by the resolution of the printer (usually given in <c>DPI:</c> dot-per-inch).
      </p> <p>All <seeerl marker="wxDC"><c>wxDC</c></seeerl> functions use instead <c>logical</c> units, unless where explicitly stated. Logical units are arbitrary units mapped to device units using the current mapping mode (see <seemfa marker="#setMapMode/2"><c>setMapMode/2</c></seemfa>).
      </p> <p>This mechanism allows reusing the same code which prints on e.g. a window on the screen to print on e.g. a paper.
      </p><p>Support for Transparency / Alpha Channel</p> <p>In general <seeerl marker="wxDC"><c>wxDC</c></seeerl> methods don't support alpha transparency and the alpha component of <seetype marker="wx#wx_colour"><c>wx_color()</c></seetype> is simply ignored and you need to use <seeerl marker="wxGraphicsContext"><c>wxGraphicsContext</c></seeerl> for full transparency support. There are, however, a few exceptions: first, under macOS and GTK+ 3 colours with alpha channel are supported in all the normal wxDC-derived classes as they use <seeerl marker="wxGraphicsContext"><c>wxGraphicsContext</c></seeerl> internally. Second, under all platforms <c>wxSVGFileDC</c> (not implemented in wx) also fully supports alpha channel. In both of these cases the instances of <seeerl marker="wxPen"><c>wxPen</c></seeerl> or <seeerl marker="wxBrush"><c>wxBrush</c></seeerl> that are built from <seetype marker="wx#wx_colour"><c>wx_color()</c></seetype> use the colour's alpha values when stroking or filling.
      </p><p>Support for Transformation Matrix</p> <p>On some platforms (currently under MSW, GTK+ 3, macOS) <seeerl marker="wxDC"><c>wxDC</c></seeerl> has support for applying an arbitrary affine transformation matrix to its coordinate system (since 3.1.1 this feature is also supported by <seeerl marker="wxGCDC"><c>wxGCDC</c></seeerl> in all ports). Call <c>CanUseTransformMatrix()</c> (not implemented in wx) to check if this support is available and then call <c>SetTransformMatrix()</c> (not implemented in wx) if it is. If the transformation matrix is not supported, <c>SetTransformMatrix()</c> (not implemented in wx) always simply returns <c>false</c> and doesn't do anything.
      </p> <p>This feature is only available when <c>wxUSE_DC_TRANSFORM_MATRIX</c> build option is enabled.
