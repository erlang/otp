<description><p><seeerl marker="wxWindow"><c>wxWindow</c></seeerl> is the base class for all windows and represents any visible object on screen. All controls, top level windows and so on are windows. Sizers and device contexts are not, however, as they don't appear on screen themselves.
      </p><p>Please note that all children of the window will be deleted automatically by the destructor before the window itself is deleted which means that you don't have to worry about deleting them manually. Please see the window deletion overview for more information.
      </p><p>Also note that in this, and many others, wxWidgets classes some <c>GetXXX()</c> methods may be overloaded (as, for example, <seemfa marker="#getSize/1"><c>getSize/1</c></seemfa> or <seemfa marker="#getClientSize/1"><c>getClientSize/1</c></seemfa>). In this case, the overloads are non-virtual because having multiple virtual functions with the same name results in a virtual function name hiding at the derived class level (in English, this means that the derived class has to override all overloaded variants if it overrides any of them). To allow overriding them in the derived class, wxWidgets uses a unique protected virtual <c>DoGetXXX()</c> method and all <c>GetXXX()</c> ones are forwarded to it, so overriding the former changes the behaviour of the latter.

    <desc><p>Construct the actual window object after creating the C++ object. 
      </p><p>The non-default constructor of <seeerl marker="wxWindow"><c>wxWindow</c></seeerl> class does two things: it initializes the C++ object and it also creates the window object in the underlying graphical toolkit. The <seemfa marker="#create/4"><c>create/4</c></seemfa> method can be used to perform the second part later, while the default constructor can be used to perform the first part only.
      </p><p>Please note that the underlying window must be created exactly once, i.e. if you use the default constructor, which doesn't do this, you <c>must</c> call <seemfa marker="#create/4"><c>create/4</c></seemfa> before using the window and if you use the non-default constructor, you can <c>not</c> call <seemfa marker="#create/4"><c>create/4</c></seemfa>, as the underlying window is already created.
      </p><p>Note that it is possible and, in fact, useful, to call some methods on the object between creating the C++ object itself and calling <seemfa marker="#create/4"><c>create/4</c></seemfa> on it, e.g. a common pattern to avoid showing the contents of a window before it is fully initialized is: 
      </p><p>Also note that it is possible to create an object of a derived type and then call <seemfa marker="#create/4"><c>create/4</c></seemfa> on it:  This is notably used by overview_xrc.

      </p><p>Note that wxWidgets maintains the stack of windows having captured the mouse and when the mouse is released the capture returns to the window which had had captured it previously and it is only really released if there were no previous window. In particular, this means that you must release the mouse as many times as you capture it, unless the window receives the <seeerl marker="wxMouseCaptureLostEvent"><c>wxMouseCaptureLostEvent</c></seeerl> event.
      </p><p>Any application which captures the mouse in the beginning of some operation must handle <seeerl marker="wxMouseCaptureLostEvent"><c>wxMouseCaptureLostEvent</c></seeerl> and cancel this operation when it receives the event. The event handler must not recapture mouse.

      </p><p>Remark: Close calls the close handler for the window, providing an opportunity for the window to choose whether to destroy the window. Usually it is only used with the top level windows (<seeerl marker="wxFrame"><c>wxFrame</c></seeerl> and <seeerl marker="wxDialog"><c>wxDialog</c></seeerl> classes) as the others are not supposed to have any special OnClose() logic. The close handler should check whether the window is being deleted forcibly, using <seemfa marker="wxCloseEvent#canVeto/1"><c>wxCloseEvent:canVeto/1</c></seemfa>, in which case it should destroy the window using <seemfa marker="#'Destroy'/1"><c>'Destroy'/1</c></seemfa>. Note that calling Close does not guarantee that the window will be destroyed; but it provides a way to simulate a manual close of a window, which may or may not be implemented by destroying the window. The default implementation of wxDialog::OnCloseWindow does not necessarily delete the dialog, since it will simply simulate an wxID_CANCEL event which is handled by the appropriate button event handler and may do anything at all. To guarantee that the window will be destroyed, call <seemfa marker="#'Destroy'/1"><c>'Destroy'/1</c></seemfa> instead

    <desc><p>This function is (or should be, in case of custom controls) called during window creation to intelligently set up the window visual attributes, that is the font and the foreground and background colours. 
      </p><p>By "intelligently" the following is meant: by default, all windows use their own <c>GetClassDefaultAttributes()</c> (not implemented in wx) default attributes. However if some of the parents attributes are explicitly (that is, using <seemfa marker="#setFont/2"><c>setFont/2</c></seemfa> and not <seemfa marker="#setOwnFont/2"><c>setOwnFont/2</c></seemfa>) changed and if the corresponding attribute hadn't been explicitly set for this window itself, then this window takes the same value as used by the parent. In addition, if the window overrides <seemfa marker="#shouldInheritColours/1"><c>shouldInheritColours/1</c></seemfa> to return false, the colours will not be changed no matter what and only the font might.
      </p><p>This rather complicated logic is necessary in order to accommodate the different usage scenarios. The most common one is when all default attributes are used and in this case, nothing should be inherited as in modern GUIs different controls use different fonts (and colours) than their siblings so they can't inherit the same value from the parent. However it was also deemed desirable to allow to simply change the attributes of all children at once by just changing the font or colour of their common parent, hence in this case we do inherit the parents attributes.

    <desc><p>Sets the background colour of the window. 
      </p><p>Notice that as with <seemfa marker="#setForegroundColour/2"><c>setForegroundColour/2</c></seemfa>, setting the background colour of a native control may not affect the entire control and could be not supported at all depending on the control and platform.

      </p><p>Remark: The background colour is usually painted by the default <seeerl marker="wxEraseEvent"><c>wxEraseEvent</c></seeerl> event handler function under Windows and automatically under GTK. Note that setting the background colour does not cause an immediate refresh, so you may wish to call <seemfa marker="#clearBackground/1"><c>clearBackground/1</c></seemfa> or <seemfa marker="#refresh/2"><c>refresh/2</c></seemfa> after calling this function. Using this function will disable attempts to use themes for this window, if the system supports them. Use with care since usually the themes represent the appearance chosen by the user to be used for all applications on the system.

    <fsummary>Sets the background style of the window. </fsummary>
    <desc><p>Sets the background style of the window. 
      </p><p>The default background style is <c>wxBG_STYLE_ERASE</c> which indicates that the window background may be erased in <c>EVT_ERASE_BACKGROUND</c> handler. This is a safe, compatibility default; however you may want to change it to <c>wxBG_STYLE_SYSTEM</c> if you don't define any erase background event handlers at all, to avoid unnecessary generation of erase background events and always let system erase the background. And you should change the background style to <c>wxBG_STYLE_PAINT</c> if you define an <c>EVT_PAINT</c> handler which completely overwrites the window background as in this case erasing it previously, either in <c>EVT_ERASE_BACKGROUND</c> handler or in the system default handler, would result in flicker as the background pixels will be repainted twice every time the window is redrawn. Do ensure that the background is entirely erased by your <c>EVT_PAINT</c> handler in this case however as otherwise garbage may be left on screen.
      </p><p>Notice that in previous versions of wxWidgets a common way to work around the above mentioned flickering problem was to define an empty <c>EVT_ERASE_BACKGROUND</c> handler. Setting background style to <c>wxBG_STYLE_PAINT</c> is a simpler and more efficient solution to the same problem.
      </p><p>Under wxGTK and wxOSX, you can use ?wxBG_STYLE_TRANSPARENT to obtain full transparency of the window background. Note that wxGTK supports this only since GTK 2.12 with a compositing manager enabled, call <c>IsTransparentBackgroundSupported()</c> (not implemented in wx) to check whether this is the case.
      </p><p>Also, in order for <c>SetBackgroundStyle(wxBG_STYLE_TRANSPARENT)</c> to work, it must be called before <seemfa marker="#create/4"><c>create/4</c></seemfa>. If you're using your own wxWindow-derived class you should write your code in the following way:
