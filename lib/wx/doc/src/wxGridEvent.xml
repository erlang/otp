<description><p>This event class contains information about various grid events.
      </p><p>Notice that all grid event table macros are available in two versions: <c>EVT_GRID_XXX</c> and <c>EVT_GRID_CMD_XXX</c>. The only difference between the two is that the former doesn't allow to specify the grid window identifier and so takes a single parameter, the event handler, but is not suitable if there is more than one grid control in the window where the event table is used (as it would catch the events from all the grids). The version with <c>CMD</c> takes the id as first argument and the event handler as the second one and so can be used with multiple grids as well. Otherwise there are no difference between the two and only the versions without the id are documented below for brevity.
