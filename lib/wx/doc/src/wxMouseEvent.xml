<description><p>This event class contains information about the events generated by the mouse: they include mouse buttons press and release events and mouse move events.
      </p><p>All mouse events involving the buttons use <c>wxMOUSE_BTN_LEFT</c> for the left mouse button, <c>wxMOUSE_BTN_MIDDLE</c> for the middle one and <c>wxMOUSE_BTN_RIGHT</c> for the right one. And if the system supports more buttons, the <c>wxMOUSE_BTN_AUX1</c> and <c>wxMOUSE_BTN_AUX2</c> events can also be generated. Note that not all mice have even a middle button so a portable application should avoid relying on the events from it (but the right button click can be emulated using the left mouse button with the control key under Mac platforms with a single button mouse).
      </p><p>For the <c>wxEVT_ENTER_WINDOW</c> and <c>wxEVT_LEAVE_WINDOW</c> events purposes, the mouse is considered to be inside the window if it is in the window client area and not inside one of its children. In other words, the parent window receives <c>wxEVT_LEAVE_WINDOW</c> event not only when the mouse leaves the window entirely but also when it enters one of its children.
      </p><p>The position associated with a mouse event is expressed in the window coordinates of the window which generated the event, you can use <seemfa marker="wxWindow#clientToScreen/3"><c>wxWindow:clientToScreen/3</c></seemfa> to convert it to screen coordinates and possibly call <seemfa marker="wxWindow#screenToClient/2"><c>wxWindow:screenToClient/2</c></seemfa> next to convert it to window coordinates of another window.
      </p><p>Note: Note the difference between methods like <seemfa marker="#leftDown/1"><c>leftDown/1</c></seemfa> and the inherited <seemfa marker="#leftIsDown/1"><c>leftIsDown/1</c></seemfa>: the former returns true when the event corresponds to the left mouse button click while the latter returns true if the left mouse button is currently being pressed. For example, when the user is dragging the mouse you can use <seemfa marker="#leftIsDown/1"><c>leftIsDown/1</c></seemfa> to test whether the left mouse button is (still) depressed. Also, by convention, if <seemfa marker="#leftDown/1"><c>leftDown/1</c></seemfa> returns true, <seemfa marker="#leftIsDown/1"><c>leftIsDown/1</c></seemfa> will also return true in wxWidgets whatever the underlying GUI behaviour is (which is platform-dependent). The same applies, of course, to other mouse buttons as well.
