<modulesummary>Functions for wxControlWithItems class</modulesummary>
<description><p>This is convenience class that derives from both <seeerl marker="wxControl"><c>wxControl</c></seeerl> and <c>wxItemContainer</c> (not implemented in wx). It is used as basis for some wxWidgets controls (<seeerl marker="wxChoice"><c>wxChoice</c></seeerl> and <seeerl marker="wxListBox"><c>wxListBox</c></seeerl>).
      </p><p>See: <c>wxItemContainer</c> (not implemented in wx), <c>wxItemContainerImmutable</c> (not implemented in wx)
      </p>
  <p>This class is derived (and can use functions) from: 
    <seeerl marker="wxControl"><c>wxControl</c></seeerl> <seeerl marker="wxWindow"><c>wxWindow</c></seeerl> <seeerl marker="wxEvtHandler"><c>wxEvtHandler</c></seeerl></p>

    <desc><p>Deletes an item from the control. 
      </p><p>The client data associated with the item will be also deleted if it is owned by the control. Note that it is an error (signalled by an assert failure in debug builds) to remove an item with the index negative or greater or equal than the number of items in the control.
      </p><p>If there is a currently selected item below the item being deleted, i.e. if <seemfa marker="#getSelection/1"><c>getSelection/1</c></seemfa> returns a valid index greater than or equal to <c>n</c>, the selection is invalidated when this function is called. However if the selected item appears before the item being deleted, the selection is preserved unchanged.

      </p><p>Notice that the returned pointer is still owned by the control and will be deleted by it, use <c>DetachClientObject()</c> (not implemented in wx) if you want to remove the pointer from the control.
