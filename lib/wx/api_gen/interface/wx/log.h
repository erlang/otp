/**
    @class wxLogFormatter

    wxLogFormatter class is used to format the log messages. It implements the
    default formatting and can be derived from to create custom formatters.

    The default implementation formats the message into a string containing
    the time stamp, level-dependent prefix and the message itself.

    To change it, you can derive from it and override its Format() method. For
    example, to include the thread id in the log messages you can use
    @code
        class LogFormatterWithThread : public wxLogFormatter
        {
            virtual wxString Format(wxLogLevel level,
                                    const wxString& msg,
                                    const wxLogRecordInfo& info) const
            {
                return wxString::Format("[%d] %s(%d) : %s",
                    info.threadId, info.filename, info.line, msg);
            }
        };
    @endcode
    And then associate it with wxLog instance using its SetFormatter(). Then,
    if you call:

    @code
        wxLogMessage(_("*** Application started ***"));
    @endcode

    the log output could be something like:

    @verbatim
        [7872] d:\testApp\src\testApp.cpp(85) : *** Application started ***
    @endverbatim

    @library{wxbase}

/**

    This class allows you to temporarily suspend logging. All calls to the log

    In particular, it can be used to suppress the log messages given by wxWidgets
    itself but it should be noted that it is rarely the best way to cope with this
    problem as @b all log messages are suppressed, even if they indicate a
    completely different error than the one the programmer wanted to suppress.

    For instance, the example of the overview:

    @code
      wxFile file;

      // wxFile.Open() normally complains if file can't be opened, we don't want it
      {
        wxLogNull logNo;

      wxLogMessage("..."); // ok
    @endcode

    would be better written as:

    @code
      wxFile file;

      // don't try to open file if it doesn't exist, we are prepared to deal with
      // this ourselves - but all other errors are not expected

/**
    @class wxLogGui

    This is the default log target for the GUI wxWidgets applications.

    Please see @ref overview_log_customize for explanation of how to change the
    default log target.

    An object of this class is used by default to show the log messages created
    by using wxLogMessage(), wxLogError() and other logging functions. It
    doesn't display the messages logged by them immediately however but
    accumulates all messages logged during an event handler execution and then
    shows them all at once when its Flush() method is called during the idle
    time processing. This has the important advantage of showing only a single
    dialog to the user even if several messages were logged because of a single
    error as it often happens (e.g. a low level function could log a message
    because it failed to open a file resulting in its caller logging another
    message due to the failure of higher level operation requiring the use of
    this file). If you need to force the display of all previously logged
    messages immediately you can use wxLog::FlushActive() to force the dialog
    display.

    Also notice that if an error message is logged when several informative
    messages had been already logged before, the informative messages are
    discarded on the assumption that they are not useful -- and may be
    confusing and hence harmful -- any more after the error. The warning
    and error messages are never discarded however and any informational
    messages logged after the first error one are also kept (as they may
    contain information about the error recovery). You may override DoLog()
    method to change this behaviour.

    At any rate, it is possible that that several messages were accumulated
    before this class Flush() method is called. If this is the case, Flush()
    uses a custom dialog which shows the last message directly and allows the
    user to view the previously logged ones by expanding the "Details"
    wxCollapsiblePane inside it. This custom dialog also provides the buttons
    for copying the log messages to the clipboard and saving them to a file.

    However if only a single message is present when Flush() is called, just a
    wxMessageBox() is used to show it. This has the advantage of being closer
    to the native behaviour but it doesn't give the user any possibility to
    copy or save the message (except for the recent Windows versions where @c
    Ctrl-C may be pressed in the message box to copy its contents to the
    clipboard) so you may want to override DoShowSingleLogMessage() to
    customize wxLogGui -- the dialogs sample shows how to do this.

    Like wxLogDebug(), trace functions only do something in debug builds and

    This lets you selectively trace only some operations and not others by enabling the
    desired trace masks with wxLog::AddTraceMask() or by setting the
    @ref overview_envvars "@c WXTRACE environment variable".

    The predefined string trace masks used by wxWidgets are:

    Like wxLogDebug(), trace functions only do something in debug builds and
    expand to nothing in the release one. The reason for making it a separate
    function is that usually there are a lot of trace messages, so it might
    make sense to separate them from other debug messages.

    @deprecated
    This version of wxLogTrace() only logs the message if all the bits
    corresponding to the @a mask are set in the wxLog trace mask which can be
    set by calling wxLog::SetTraceMask(). This version is less flexible than
    wxLogTrace(const char*,const char*,...) because it doesn't allow defining
    the user trace masks easily. This is why it is deprecated in favour of
    using string trace masks.

    The following bitmasks are defined for wxTraceMask:

    @beginDefList
    @itemdef{ wxTraceMemAlloc, Trace memory allocation (new/delete) }
    @itemdef{ wxTraceMessages, Trace window messages/X callbacks }
    @itemdef{ wxTraceResAlloc, Trace GDI resource allocation }
