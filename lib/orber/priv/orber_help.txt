	Trouble shooting
	----------------

	Q. Why doesn't all my nodes show up in the node window?

	A. Are the nodes visible with the [node()|nodes()] commands 
        in the shell? If not you must do net:ping(NodeName) to add
        nodes to the Erlang distribution.

	Q. When trying to access a node I get no valid response?

	A. Make sure that Orber is running on the node.
