    <title>Interface Repository(IFR)</title>
    <p>The IFR is an interface repository built on the Mnesia
      application. Orber uses the  IFR for some type-checking
      when coding/decoding IIOP. The IFR is capable of storing all
      interfaces and declarations of OMG IDL.
      </p>
    <p>The interface repository is mainly used for dynamical
      interfaces, and as none are currently supported this function
      is only really used for retrieving information about interfaces.</p>
    <p>Functions relating to the manipulation of the IFR including,
      initialization of the IFR, as well as, locating, creating and
      destroying initial references are detailed further in the Manual
      Pages.
