          <p>
	    When converting a faulty binary to a list with
	    unicode:characters_to_list, the error return value could
	    contain a faulty "rest", i.e. the io_list of characters
	    that could not be converted was wrong. This happened only
	    if input was a sub binary and conversion was from utf8.
	    This is now corrected.</p>

	    Integrate elliptic curve contribution from Andreas
	    Schultz </p>
          <p>
	    In order to be able to support elliptic curve cipher
	    suites in SSL/TLS, additions to handle elliptic curve
	    infrastructure has been added to public_key and crypto.</p>
          <p>
	    This also has resulted in a rewrite of the crypto API to
	    gain consistency and remove unnecessary overhead. All OTP
	    applications using crypto has been updated to use the new
	    API.</p>
          <p>
	    Impact: Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) offers
	    equivalent security with smaller key sizes than other
	    public key algorithms. Smaller key sizes result in
	    savings for power, memory, bandwidth, and computational
	    cost that make ECC especially attractive for constrained
	    environments.</p>

	    Increased potential concurrency in ETS for
	    <c>write_concurrency</c> option. The number of internal
	    table locks has increased from 16 to 64. This makes it
	    four times less likely that two concurrent processes
	    writing to the same table would collide and thereby
	    serialized. The cost is an increased constant memory
	    footprint for tables using write_concurrency. The memory
	    consumption per inserted record is not affected. The
	    increased footprint can be particularly large if
	    <c>write_concurrency</c> is combined with
	    <c>read_concurrency</c>.</p>

	    Leave control back to gen_server during supervisor's
	    restart loop</p>
          <p>
	    When an attempt to restart a child failed, supervisor
	    would earlier keep the execution flow and try to restart
	    the child over and over again until it either succeeded
	    or the restart frequency limit was reached. If none of
	    these happened, supervisor would hang forever in this
	    loop.</p>
          <p>
	    This commit adds a timer of 0 ms where the control is
	    left back to the gen_server which implements the
	    supervisor. This way any incoming request to the
	    supervisor will be handled - which could help breaking
	    the infinite loop - e.g. shutdown request for the
	    supervisor or for the problematic child.</p>
          <p>
	    This introduces some incompatibilities in stdlib due to
	    new return values from supervisor: <list>
	    <item>restart_child/2 can now return
	    {error,restarting}</item> <item>delete_child/2 can now
	    return {error,restarting}</item> <item>which_children/1
	    returns a list of {Id,Child,Type,Mods}, where Child, in
	    addition to the old pid() or 'undefined', now also can be
	    'restarting'.</item> </list></p>

	    <p> When an escript ends now all printout to standard
	    output and standard error gets out on the terminal. This
	    bug has been corrected by changing the behaviour of
	    erlang:halt/0,1, which should fix the same problem for
	    other escript-like applications, i.e that data stored in
	    the output port driver buffers got lost when printing on
	    a TTY and exiting through erlang:halt/0,1. </p>
	    <p> The BIF:s erlang:halt/0,1 has gotten improved
	    semantics and there is a new BIF erlang:halt/2 to
	    accomplish something like the old semantics. See the
	    documentation. </p>
	    <p> Now erlang:halt/0 and erlang:halt/1 with an integer
	    argument will close all ports and allow all pending async
	    threads operations to finish before exiting the emulator.
	    Previously erlang:halt/0 and erlang:halt(0) would just
	    wait for pending async threads operations but not close
	    ports. And erlang:halt/1 with a non-zero integer argument
	    would not even wait for pending async threads operations.
	    </p>
	    <p> To roughly the old behaviour, to not wait for ports
	    and async threads operations when you exit the emulator,
	    you use erlang:halt/2 with an integer first argument and
	    an option list containing {flush,false} as the second
	    argument. Note that now is flushing not dependant of the
	    exit code, and you can not only flush async threads
	    operations which we deemed as a strange behaviour anyway.
	    </p>
	    <p>Also, erlang:halt/1,2 has gotten a new feature: If the
	    first argument is the atom 'abort' the emulator is
	    aborted producing a core dump, if the operating system so
	    allows. </p>

	    Behaviours may define specs for their callbacks using the

	    that no callbacks are defined twice and all types
	    referred are declared.</p>
          <p>

	    Explicitly kill dynamic children in supervisors</p>
          <p>
	    According to the supervisor's documentation: "Important
	    note on simple-one-for-one supervisors: The dynamically
	    created child processes of a simple-one-for-one
	    supervisor are not explicitly killed, regardless of
	    shutdown strategy, but are expected to terminate when the
	    supervisor does (that is, when an exit signal from the
	    parent process is received)."</p>
          <p>
	    All is fine as long as we stop simple_one_for_one
	    supervisor manually. Dynamic children catch the exit
	    signal from the supervisor and leave. But, if this
	    happens when we stop an application, after the top
	    supervisor has stopped, the application master kills all
	    remaining processes associated to this application. So,
	    dynamic children that trap exit signals can be killed
	    during their cleanup (here we mean inside terminate/2).
	    This is unpredictable and highly time-dependent.</p>
          <p>
	    In this commit, supervisor module is patched to
	    explicitly terminate dynamic children accordingly to the
	    shutdown strategy.</p>
          <p>
	    NOTE: Order in which dynamic children are stopped is not
	    defined. In fact, this is "almost" done at the same time.</p>
          <p>
	    Stack errors when dynamic children are stopped</p>
          <p>
	    Because a simple_one_for_one supervisor can have many
	    workers, we stack errors during its shutdown to report
	    only one message for each encountered error type. Instead
	    of reporting the child's pid, we use the number of
	    concerned children. (Thanks to Christopher Faulet)</p>

	    Allow an infinite timeout to shutdown worker processes</p>
          <p>
	    Now, in child specification, the shutdown value can also
	    be set to infinity for worker children. This restriction
	    was removed because this is not always possible to
	    predict the shutdown time for a worker. This is highly
	    application-dependent. Add a warning to docs about
	    workers' shutdown strategy (Thanks to Christopher Faulet)</p>

	    fix supervisors restarting temporary children</p>
          <p>
	    In the current implementation of supervisors, temporary
	    children should never be restarted. However, when a
	    temporary child is restarted as part of a one_for_all or
	    rest_for_one strategy where the failing process is not
	    the temporary child, the supervisor still tries to
	    restart it.</p>
          <p>
	    Because the supervisor doesn't keep some of the MFA
	    information of temporary children, this causes the
	    supervisor to hit its restart limit and crash.</p>
          <p>
	    This patch fixes the behaviour by inserting a clause in
	    terminate_children/2-3 (private function) that will omit
	    temporary children when building a list of killed
	    processes, to avoid having the supervisor trying to
	    restart them again.</p>
          <p>
	    Only supervisors in need of restarting children used the
	    list, so the change should be of no impact for the
	    functions that called terminate_children/2-3 only to kill
	    all children.</p>
          <p>
	    The documentation has been modified to make this
	    behaviour more explicit. (Thanks to Fred Hebert)</p>

	    Since the log_mf_h index file might be read by other

	    hitting the time gap between opening the file in write

	    Supervisors should not save child-specs for temporary
	    processes when they terminate as they should not be
	    restarted. Saving the temporary child spec will result in
	    that you can not start a new temporary process with the
	    same child spec as an already terminated temporary
	    process. Since R14B02 you can not restart a temporary
	    temporary process as arguments are no longer saved, it
	    has however always been semantically incorrect to restart
	    a temporary process. Thanks to Filipe David Manana for
	    reporting this and suggesting a solution.</p>

          <p>
	    The pool module prints out an error message and takes no

	    slave:start/3 is {already_running, Node} then an attempt
	    to attach to the node is still made. This makes sense
	    because the node has been specified by the user in the
	    .hosts.erlang file indicating a wish for the node to be
	    part of the pool and a manual attach can be successfully
	    made after the pool is started.(Thanks to Kelly

	    Large parts of the <c>ethread</c> library have been
	    rewritten. The <c>ethread</c> library is an Erlang
	    runtime system internal, portable thread library used by
	    the runtime system itself.</p>
          <p>
	    Most notable improvement is a reader optimized rwlock
	    implementation which dramatically improve the performance
	    of read-lock/read-unlock operations on multi processor
	    systems by avoiding ping-ponging of the rwlock cache
	    lines. The reader optimized rwlock implementation is used
	    by miscellaneous rwlocks in the runtime system that are
	    known to be read-locked frequently, and can be enabled on
	    ETS tables by passing the <seealso
	    marker="stdlib:ets#new_2_read_concurrency">{read_concurrency,
	    true}</seealso> option upon table creation. See the
	    documentation of <seealso
	    marker="stdlib:ets#new/2">ets:new/2</seealso> for more
	    information. The reader optimized rwlock implementation
	    can be fine tuned when starting the runtime system. For
	    more information, see the documentation of the <seealso
	    marker="erts:erl#+rg">+rg</seealso> command line argument
	    of <c>erl</c>.</p>
          <p>
	    There is also a new implementation of rwlocks that is not
	    optimized for readers. Both implementations interleaves
	    readers and writers during contention as opposed to,
	    e.g., the NPTL (Linux) pthread rwlock implementation
	    which use either a reader or writer preferred strategy.
	    The reader/writer preferred strategy is problematic since
	    it starves threads doing the non-preferred operation.</p>
          <p>
	    The new rwlock implementations in general performs better
	    in ERTS than common pthread implementations. However, in
	    some extremely heavily contended cases this is not the
	    case. Such heavy contention can more or less only appear
	    on ETS tables. This when multiple processes do very large
	    amounts of write locked operations simultaneously on the
	    same table. Such use of ETS is bad regardless of rwlock
	    implementation, will never scale, and is something we
	    strongly advise against.</p>
          <p>
	    The new rwlock implementations depend on atomic
	    operations. If no native atomic implementation is found,
	    a fallback solution will be used. Using the fallback
	    implies a performance degradation. That is, it is more
	    important now than before to build OTP with a native
	    atomic implementation.</p>
          <p>
	    The <c>ethread</c> library contains native atomic
	    implementations for, x86 (32 and 64 bit), powerpc (32
	    bit), sparc V9 (32 and 64 bit), and tilera (32 bit). On
	    other hardware gcc's builtin support for atomic memory
	    access will be used if such exists. If no such support is
	    found, <c>configure</c> will warn about no atomic
	    implementation available.</p>
          <p>
	    The <c>ethread</c> library can now also use the
	    <c>libatomic_ops</c> library for atomic memory accesses.
	    This makes it possible for the Erlang runtime system to
	    utilize optimized native atomic operations on more
	    platforms than before. If <c>configure</c> warns about no
	    atomic implementation available, try using the
	    <c>libatomic_ops</c> library. Use the <seealso
	    marker="doc/installation_guide:INSTALL#How-to-Build-and-Install-ErlangOTP_A-Closer-Look-at-the-individual-Steps_Configuring">--with-libatomic_ops=PATH</seealso>
	    <c>configure</c> command line argument when specifying
	    where the <c>libatomic_ops</c> installation is located.
	    The <c>libatomic_ops</c> library can be downloaded from:
	    <url
	    href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/atomic_ops/">http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/atomic_ops/</url></p>
          <p>
	    The changed API of the <c>ethread</c> library has also
	    caused modifications in the Erlang runtime system.
	    Preparations for the to come "delayed deallocation"
	    feature has also been done since it depends on the
	    <c>ethread</c> library.</p>
          <p>
	    <em>Note</em>: When building for x86, the <c>ethread</c>
	    library will now use instructions that first appeared on
	    the pentium 4 processor. If you want the runtime system
	    to be compatible with older processors (back to 486) you
	    need to pass the <seealso
	    marker="doc/installation_guide:INSTALL#How-to-Build-and-Install-ErlangOTP_A-Closer-Look-at-the-individual-Steps_Configuring">--enable-ethread-pre-pentium4-compatibility</seealso>
	    <c>configure</c> command line argument when configuring
	    the system.</p>

	    The recently added BIFs erlang:min/2, erlang:max/2 and
	    erlang:port_command/3 are now auto-imported (as they were
	    originally intended to be). Due to the recent compiler
	    change (OTP-8579), the only impact on old code defining
	    it's own min/2, max/2 or port_command/3 functions will be
	    a warning, the local functions will still be used. The
	    warning can be removed by using
	    -compile({no_auto_import,[min/2,max/2,port_command/3]}).

	    Because of a race condition, using filelib:ensure_dir/1
	    from multiple processes to create the same path or parts
	    of the same directory structure, filelib:ensure_dir/1
	    could return a meaningless {error,eexist}. That race
	    condition has been eliminated, and {error,eexist} will
	    now be returned only if there exists a regular file,

	    <p>Fixed a minor race conditions in

	    <p>A process started by <c>proc_lib</c> in some cases
	    depended on its process dictionary not to be erased, and
	    would crash when terminating abnormally and not generate
	    a proper crash report. This has been corrected (but the
	    initial call will not be shown in the error report if the
	    process dictionary has been erased). NOTE: There is no
	    longer any need to erase the process dictionary for
	    memory conservation reasons, since the actual call
	    arguments are no longer saved in the process
	    dictionary.</p>

	    <p>Support for Unicode is implemented as described in
	    EEP10. Formatting and reading of unicode data both from
	    terminals and files is supported by the io and io_lib
	    modules. Files can be opened in modes with automatic
	    translation to and from different unicode formats. The
	    module 'unicode' contains functions for conversion
	    between external and internal unicode formats and the re
	    module has support for unicode data. There is also
	    language syntax for specifying string and character data
	    beyond the ISO-latin-1 range.</p>
	    <p>The interactive shell will support input and output of
	    unicode characters when the terminal and operating system
	    supports it.</p>
	    <p>Please see the EEP and the io/io_lib manual pages as
	    well as the stdlib users guide for details.</p>
	    <p><em>I/O-protocol incompatibilities:</em></p>
	    <p>The io_protocol between io_Server and client is
	    updated to handle protocol data in unicode formats. The
	    updated protocol is now documented. The specification
	    resides in the stdlib <em>users manual</em>, which is a
	    new part of the manual.</p>
	    <p><em>io module incompatibilities:</em></p>
	    <p>The io:put_chars, io:get_chars and io:get_line all
	    handle and return unicode data. In the case where
	    binaries can be provided (as to io:put_chars), they shall
	    be encoded in UTF-8. When binaries are returned (as by
	    io:get_line/get_chars when the io_server is set in
	    <em>binary mode</em>) the returned data is also
	    <em>always</em> encoded as UTF-8. The file module however
	    still returns byte-oriented data, why file:read can be
	    used instead of io:get_chars to read binary data in
	    ISO-latin-1.</p>
	    <p><em>io_lib module incompatibilities:</em></p>
	    <p>io_lib:format can, given new format directives (i.e
	    "~ts" and "~tc"), return lists containing integers larger
	    than 255. </p>

	    for the initial call, but only the arity.</p>
	    <p>Also, if <c>proc_lib:spawn/1</c> is used to spawn a

	    function name, and arity of the function that implements

	    <p>The reason for the change is that keeping the initial
	    fun (or a fun in an argument list), would prevent

	    that keeping the fun and function arguments could waste a
	    significant amount of memory.</p>

	    An experimental module "re" is added to the emulator

	    <p>The <c>queue</c> module has been rewritten to make it
	    easier to use. Suggestions and discussion from and with
	    among others Lev Walkin, Anders Ramsell and Rober Virding
	    in december 2007 on erlang-questions@erlang.org. It was
	    also discussed to change the internal representation to
	    contain length information which would speed up
	    <c>len/1</c> but that change has been postponed. Anyone
	    interested may write an EEP and try to reach an
	    acceptable compromise for queue overhead and thereby the
	    speed of all other operations than <c>len/1</c>. The
	    <c>queue</c> module is now optimized for fast and minimal
	    garbage <c>in/2</c> and <c>out/1</c> and such. See the
	    documentation.</p>
	    <p>New functions: <c>is_queue/1</c>, <c>get/1</c>,

	    <c>is_queue/1</c> is a new predicate, <c>liat/1</c> is a
	    correction of an old misspelling, and the others

	    compared the key column or some indexed column of the the
	    table with a column of some other table, <c>qlc</c>
	    always chose to traverse the table first, never
	    considering lookup join. This has been changed so that
	    lookup join is always preferred; if an initial traversal
	    using the match specification is desired, the query needs
	    to be rewritten introducing an extra QLC with the
	    filter(s) restricting the column.</item> <item>When
	    trying to find candidates for match specifications and
	    lookup, filters using variables from one generator only
	    are ignored unless they are placed immediately after the

            Shell process exit left you with an unresponsive initial
            shell if not using oldshell. Starting a restricted shell
            with a nonexisting callback module resulted in a shell
            where no commands could be used, not even init:stop/0.
            Fun's could not be used as parameters to local shell
            functions (in shell_default or user_default) when
            restricted_shell was active.</p>

            <c>join</c> option that can be used to force QLC to use a
            particular kind of join in some QLC expression.</p>

                <c>eval/2</c>, <c>fold/4</c>, and <c>info/2</c> can be
                used to set the directory that join uses for temporary
                files. The option also overrides the <c>tmpdir</c> option

              <p>The new <c>lookup</c> option can be used to

              <p>The <c>cache</c> and <c>cache_all</c> options
                accept new tags: <c>ets</c>, <c>list</c>, and <c>no</c>.
                The tag <c>list</c> caches answers in a list using a
                temporary file if the answers cannot be held in RAM.
                Combining <c>{cache,list}</c> and <c>{unique, true}</c>
                is equivalent to calling <c>sort/2</c> with the option
                <c>unique</c> set to <c>true</c>. The old tags
                <c>true</c> (equivalent to <c>ets</c>) and <c>false</c>
                (equivalent to <c>no</c>) are recognized for backward

                were analyzed.</p>
              <p>Note that only filters with guard
                syntax placed immediately after the generator are

          <p>To help Dialyzer find more bugs, many functions in the
            Kernel and STDLIB applications now only accept arguments
            of the type that is documented.</p>
          <p>For instance, the functions <c>lists:prefix/2</c> and
            <c>lists:suffix/2</c> are documented to only accept lists
            as their arguments, but they actually accepted anything
            and returned <c>false</c>. That has been changed so that
            the functions cause an exception if one or both arguments
            are not lists.</p>
          <p>Also, the <c>string:strip/3</c> function is documented
            to take a character argument that is a character to strip
            from one or both ends of the string. Given a list instead
            of a character, it used to do nothing, but will now cause
            an exception.</p>
          <p>Dialyzer will find most cases where those functions
            are passed arguments of the wrong type.</p>

          <p>A bug in the evaluator that caused the shell to choke on
            bit syntax expressions has been fixed.</p>

          <p><c>io:format/2</c> et.al no longer crashes for some
            combinations of precision and value for format character
            "g". Previously it crashed if the precision P was 4 or lower
            and the absolute value of the float to print was lower
            than 10^4 but 10^(P-1) or higher. Now it will not crash
            depending on the value of the float.</p>

          <p><c>gb_sets:del_element/2</c> was changed to do the
            same as <c>gb_sets:delete_any/2</c> which was the
            original intention, not as <c>gb_sets:delete/2</c>. Code
            that relies on <c>gb_sets:del_element/2</c> causing an
            error if the element does not exist must be changed to
            call <c>gb_sets:delete/2</c> instead.</p>
          <p>The documentation was also updated to explicitly
            document functions that were only referred to as
            'aliases' of a documented function. Also, a list of all
            functions common to the <c>gb_sets</c>, <c>sets</c>, and
            <c>ordsets</c> was added.</p>

          <p>The <c>-rsh</c> switch for starting a remote shell

          <p>The Pman 'trace shell' functionality was broken as has
            now been fixed. Furthermore, Pman could not correctly
            find the pid of the active shell if more than one shell
            process was running on the node. This has also been
            corrected.</p>

          <p>You can now start Erlang with the <c>-rsh</c> flag which
            gives you a remote initial shell instead of a local one.
            Example:</p>
          <pre>
            erl -sname this_node -rsh other_node@other_host

          <p>The top level group leader used to be listed as job #1 in
            the job list in JCL mode. Since there is no shell
            associated with this process that can be connected to, it
            will no longer be listed.</p>

          <p>The possibility to start the Erlang shell in parallel
            with the rest of the system has been reintroduced for
            backwards compatibility. Note that this old behaviour is
            error prone and should not be used unless for some reason
            necessary.</p>
