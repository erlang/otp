	    <p>A mechanism for limiting the amount of text that the
	    built-in error logger events will produce has been
	    introduced. It is useful for limiting both the size of
	    log files and the CPU time used to produce them.</p>
	    <p>This mechanism is experimental in the sense that it
	    may be changed if it turns out that it does not solve the
	    problem it is supposed to solve. In that case, there may
	    be backward incompatible improvements to this
	    mechanism.</p>
	    <p>See the documentation for the config parameter
	    <c>error_logger_format_depth</c> in the Kernel
	    application for information about how to turn on this
	    feature.</p>

    <section><title>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</title>

        <item>
          <p>
	    Fix handling of single dot in filename:join/2</p>
          <p>
	    The reference manual says that filename:join(A,B) is
	    equivalent to filename:join([A,B]). In some rare cases
	    this turns out not to be true. For example:</p>
          <p>
	    <c>filename:join("/a/.","b") -&gt; "/a/./b"</c> vs
	    <c>filename:join(["/a/.","b"]) -&gt; "/a/b"</c>.</p>
          <p>
	    This has been corrected. A single dot is now only kept if
	    it occurs at the very beginning or the very end of the
	    resulting path.</p>

	    This patch stores nowarn_bif_clash in the lint record. By
	    using erlc +'{eprof,lint_module}' when compiling the
	    erlang parser, we noticed the time spent on
	    nowarn_function/2 reduced from 30% to 0.01%.</p>

	    There are many cases where user code needs to be able to
	    distinguish between a socket that was closed normally and
	    one that was aborted. Setting the option
	    {show_econnreset, true} enables the user to receive
	    ECONNRESET errors on both active and passive sockets.</p>

	    Allow maps for supervisor flags and child specs</p>
          <p>
	    Earlier, supervisor flags and child specs were given as
	    tuples. While this is kept for backwards compatibility,
	    it is now also allowed to give these parameters as maps,
	    see <seealso
	    marker="stdlib:supervisor#sup_flags">sup_flags</seealso>
	    and <seealso
	    marker="stdlib:supervisor#child_spec">child_spec</seealso>.</p>

	    A new system message, <c>terminate</c>, is added. This
	    can be sent with <c>sys:terminate/2,3</c>. If the
	    receiving process handles system messages properly it
	    will terminate shortly after receiving this message.</p>
          <p>
	    The new function <c>proc_lib:stop/1,3</c> utilizes this
	    new system message and monitors the receiving process in
	    order to facilitate a synchronous stop mechanism for
	    'special processes'.</p>
          <p>
	    <c>proc_lib:stop/1,3</c> is used by the following

	    Remove the <c>pg</c> module, which has been deprecated
	    through OTP-17, is now removed from the STDLIB
	    application. This module has been marked experimental for
	    more than 15 years, and has largely been superseded by
	    the <c>pg2</c> module from the Kernel application.</p>

	    <c>build_text/1</c>-- which expose the parsed form of the
	    format control sequences to make it possible to easily
	    modify or filter the input to <c>io_lib:format/2</c>.
	    This can e.g. be used in order to replace unbounded-size
	    control sequences like <c>~w</c> or <c>~p</c> with
	    corresponding depth-limited <c>~W</c> and <c>~P</c>

	    Supports tar file creation on other media than file
	    systems mounted on the local machine.</p>
          <p>
	    The <c>erl_tar</c> api is extended with
	    <c>erl_tar:init/3</c> that enables usage of user provided
	    media storage routines. A ssh-specific set of such
	    routines is hidden in the new function
	    <c>ssh_sftp:open_tar/3</c> to simplify creating a tar
	    archive on a remote ssh server.</p>
          <p>
	    A chunked file reading option is added to
	    <c>erl_tar:add/3,4</c> to save memory on e.g small
	    embedded systems. The size of the slices read from a file
	    in that case can be specified.</p>

	    A call to either the <c>garbage_collect/1</c> BIF or the
	    <c>check_process_code/2</c> BIF may trigger garbage
	    collection of another processes than the process calling
	    the BIF. The previous implementations performed these
	    kinds of garbage collections without considering the
	    internal state of the process being garbage collected. In
	    order to be able to more easily and more efficiently
	    implement yielding native code, these types of garbage
	    collections have been rewritten. A garbage collection
	    like this is now triggered by an asynchronous request
	    signal, the actual garbage collection is performed by the
	    process being garbage collected itself, and finalized by
	    a reply signal to the process issuing the request. Using
	    this approach processes can disable garbage collection
	    and yield without having to set up the heap in a state
	    that can be garbage collected.</p>

	    Characteristics impact: A call to the
	    <c>garbage_collect/1</c> BIF or the

	    EEP43: New data type - Maps</p>
          <p>
	    With Maps you may for instance: <taglist> <item><c>M0 =
	    #{ a =&gt; 1, b =&gt; 2}, % create
	    associations</c></item> <item><c>M1 = M0#{ a := 10 }, %

	    "hi" := V1, a := V2, b := V3} = M2. % match keys with
	    values</c></item> </taglist></p>
        <p>
	    For information on how to use Maps please see Map Expressions in the
		<seealso marker="doc/reference_manual:expressions#map_expressions">
			Reference Manual</seealso>.</p>
          <p>
	    The current implementation is without the following

	    comprehensions</item> </taglist></p>

	    Integrate elliptic curve contribution from Andreas
	    Schultz </p>
          <p>
	    In order to be able to support elliptic curve cipher
	    suites in SSL/TLS, additions to handle elliptic curve
	    infrastructure has been added to public_key and crypto.</p>
          <p>
	    This also has resulted in a rewrite of the crypto API to
	    gain consistency and remove unnecessary overhead. All OTP
	    applications using crypto has been updated to use the new
	    API.</p>
          <p>
	    Impact: Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) offers
	    equivalent security with smaller key sizes than other
	    public key algorithms. Smaller key sizes result in
	    savings for power, memory, bandwidth, and computational
	    cost that make ECC especially attractive for constrained
	    environments.</p>

	    If a child process fails in its start function, then the
	    error reason was earlier only reported as an error report
	    from the error_handler, and supervisor:start_link would
	    only return <c>{error,shutdown}</c>. This has been
	    changed so the supervisor will now return
	    <c>{error,{shutdown,Reason}}</c>, where <c>Reason</c>
	    identifies the failing child and its error reason.

	    Increased potential concurrency in ETS for
	    <c>write_concurrency</c> option. The number of internal
	    table locks has increased from 16 to 64. This makes it
	    four times less likely that two concurrent processes
	    writing to the same table would collide and thereby
	    serialized. The cost is an increased constant memory
	    footprint for tables using write_concurrency. The memory
	    consumption per inserted record is not affected. The
	    increased footprint can be particularly large if
	    <c>write_concurrency</c> is combined with
	    <c>read_concurrency</c>.</p>

	    Leave control back to gen_server during supervisor's
	    restart loop</p>
          <p>
	    When an attempt to restart a child failed, supervisor
	    would earlier keep the execution flow and try to restart
	    the child over and over again until it either succeeded
	    or the restart frequency limit was reached. If none of
	    these happened, supervisor would hang forever in this
	    loop.</p>
          <p>
	    This commit adds a timer of 0 ms where the control is
	    left back to the gen_server which implements the
	    supervisor. This way any incoming request to the
	    supervisor will be handled - which could help breaking
	    the infinite loop - e.g. shutdown request for the
	    supervisor or for the problematic child.</p>
          <p>
	    This introduces some incompatibilities in stdlib due to
	    new return values from supervisor: <list>
	    <item>restart_child/2 can now return
	    {error,restarting}</item> <item>delete_child/2 can now
	    return {error,restarting}</item> <item>which_children/1
	    returns a list of {Id,Child,Type,Mods}, where Child, in
	    addition to the old pid() or 'undefined', now also can be
	    'restarting'.</item> </list></p>

	    <p> When an escript ends now all printout to standard
	    output and standard error gets out on the terminal. This
	    bug has been corrected by changing the behaviour of
	    erlang:halt/0,1, which should fix the same problem for
	    other escript-like applications, i.e that data stored in
	    the output port driver buffers got lost when printing on
	    a TTY and exiting through erlang:halt/0,1. </p>
	    <p> The BIF:s erlang:halt/0,1 has gotten improved
	    semantics and there is a new BIF erlang:halt/2 to
	    accomplish something like the old semantics. See the
	    documentation. </p>
	    <p> Now erlang:halt/0 and erlang:halt/1 with an integer
	    argument will close all ports and allow all pending async
	    threads operations to finish before exiting the emulator.
	    Previously erlang:halt/0 and erlang:halt(0) would just
	    wait for pending async threads operations but not close
	    ports. And erlang:halt/1 with a non-zero integer argument
	    would not even wait for pending async threads operations.
	    </p>
	    <p> To roughly the old behaviour, to not wait for ports
	    and async threads operations when you exit the emulator,
	    you use erlang:halt/2 with an integer first argument and
	    an option list containing {flush,false} as the second
	    argument. Note that now is flushing not dependant of the
	    exit code, and you can not only flush async threads
	    operations which we deemed as a strange behaviour anyway.
	    </p>
	    <p>Also, erlang:halt/1,2 has gotten a new feature: If the
	    first argument is the atom 'abort' the emulator is
	    aborted producing a core dump, if the operating system so
	    allows. </p>

	    'behaviour_info' function from '-callback' attributes</p>
          <p>
	    'behaviour_info(callbacks)' is a special function that is
	    defined in a module which describes a behaviour and
	    returns a list of its callbacks.</p>
          <p>
	    This function is now automatically generated using the
	    '-callback' specs. An error is returned by lint if user
	    defines both '-callback' attributes and the
	    behaviour_info/1 function. If no type info is needed for
	    a callback use a generic spec for it. Add '-callback'
	    attribute to language syntax</p>
          <p>
	    Behaviours may define specs for their callbacks using the
	    familiar spec syntax, replacing the '-spec' keyword with
	    '-callback'. Simple lint checks are performed to ensure
	    that no callbacks are defined twice and all types
	    referred are declared.</p>
          <p>

	    Explicitly kill dynamic children in supervisors</p>
          <p>
	    According to the supervisor's documentation: "Important
	    note on simple-one-for-one supervisors: The dynamically
	    created child processes of a simple-one-for-one
	    supervisor are not explicitly killed, regardless of
	    shutdown strategy, but are expected to terminate when the
	    supervisor does (that is, when an exit signal from the
	    parent process is received)."</p>
          <p>
	    All is fine as long as we stop simple_one_for_one
	    supervisor manually. Dynamic children catch the exit
	    signal from the supervisor and leave. But, if this
	    happens when we stop an application, after the top
	    supervisor has stopped, the application master kills all
	    remaining processes associated to this application. So,
	    dynamic children that trap exit signals can be killed
	    during their cleanup (here we mean inside terminate/2).
	    This is unpredictable and highly time-dependent.</p>
          <p>
	    In this commit, supervisor module is patched to
	    explicitly terminate dynamic children accordingly to the
	    shutdown strategy.</p>
          <p>
	    NOTE: Order in which dynamic children are stopped is not
	    defined. In fact, this is "almost" done at the same time.</p>
          <p>
	    Stack errors when dynamic children are stopped</p>
          <p>
	    Because a simple_one_for_one supervisor can have many
	    workers, we stack errors during its shutdown to report
	    only one message for each encountered error type. Instead
	    of reporting the child's pid, we use the number of
	    concerned children. (Thanks to Christopher Faulet)</p>

	    Allow an infinite timeout to shutdown worker processes</p>
          <p>
	    Now, in child specification, the shutdown value can also
	    be set to infinity for worker children. This restriction
	    was removed because this is not always possible to
	    predict the shutdown time for a worker. This is highly
	    application-dependent. Add a warning to docs about
	    workers' shutdown strategy (Thanks to Christopher Faulet)</p>

	    fix supervisors restarting temporary children</p>
          <p>
	    In the current implementation of supervisors, temporary
	    children should never be restarted. However, when a
	    temporary child is restarted as part of a one_for_all or
	    rest_for_one strategy where the failing process is not
	    the temporary child, the supervisor still tries to
	    restart it.</p>
          <p>
	    Because the supervisor doesn't keep some of the MFA
	    information of temporary children, this causes the
	    supervisor to hit its restart limit and crash.</p>
          <p>
	    This patch fixes the behaviour by inserting a clause in
	    terminate_children/2-3 (private function) that will omit
	    temporary children when building a list of killed
	    processes, to avoid having the supervisor trying to
	    restart them again.</p>
          <p>
	    Only supervisors in need of restarting children used the
	    list, so the change should be of no impact for the
	    functions that called terminate_children/2-3 only to kill
	    all children.</p>
          <p>
	    The documentation has been modified to make this
	    behaviour more explicit. (Thanks to Fred Hebert)</p>

	    Supervisors should not save child-specs for temporary
	    processes when they terminate as they should not be
	    restarted. Saving the temporary child spec will result in
	    that you can not start a new temporary process with the
	    same child spec as an already terminated temporary
	    process. Since R14B02 you can not restart a temporary
	    temporary process as arguments are no longer saved, it
	    has however always been semantically incorrect to restart
	    a temporary process. Thanks to Filipe David Manana for

	    part of the pool and a manual attach can be successfully
	    made after the pool is started.(Thanks to Kelly

	    Two bugs in io:format for ~F.~Ps has been corrected. When
	    length(S) >= abs(F) > P, the precision P was incorrectly
	    ignored. When F == P > lenght(S) the result was
	    incorrectly left adjusted. Bug found by Ali Yakout who
	    also provided a fix.</p>

	    Large parts of the <c>ethread</c> library have been
	    rewritten. The <c>ethread</c> library is an Erlang
	    runtime system internal, portable thread library used by
	    the runtime system itself.</p>
          <p>
	    Most notable improvement is a reader optimized rwlock
	    implementation which dramatically improve the performance
	    of read-lock/read-unlock operations on multi processor
	    systems by avoiding ping-ponging of the rwlock cache
	    lines. The reader optimized rwlock implementation is used
	    by miscellaneous rwlocks in the runtime system that are
	    known to be read-locked frequently, and can be enabled on
	    ETS tables by passing the <seealso
	    marker="stdlib:ets#new_2_read_concurrency">{read_concurrency,
	    true}</seealso> option upon table creation. See the
	    documentation of <seealso
	    marker="stdlib:ets#new/2">ets:new/2</seealso> for more
	    information. The reader optimized rwlock implementation
	    can be fine tuned when starting the runtime system. For
	    more information, see the documentation of the <seealso
	    marker="erts:erl#+rg">+rg</seealso> command line argument
	    of <c>erl</c>.</p>
          <p>
	    There is also a new implementation of rwlocks that is not
	    optimized for readers. Both implementations interleaves
	    readers and writers during contention as opposed to,
	    e.g., the NPTL (Linux) pthread rwlock implementation
	    which use either a reader or writer preferred strategy.
	    The reader/writer preferred strategy is problematic since
	    it starves threads doing the non-preferred operation.</p>
          <p>
	    The new rwlock implementations in general performs better
	    in ERTS than common pthread implementations. However, in
	    some extremely heavily contended cases this is not the
	    case. Such heavy contention can more or less only appear
	    on ETS tables. This when multiple processes do very large
	    amounts of write locked operations simultaneously on the
	    same table. Such use of ETS is bad regardless of rwlock
	    implementation, will never scale, and is something we
	    strongly advise against.</p>
          <p>
	    The new rwlock implementations depend on atomic
	    operations. If no native atomic implementation is found,
	    a fallback solution will be used. Using the fallback
	    implies a performance degradation. That is, it is more
	    important now than before to build OTP with a native
	    atomic implementation.</p>
          <p>
	    The <c>ethread</c> library contains native atomic
	    implementations for, x86 (32 and 64 bit), powerpc (32
	    bit), sparc V9 (32 and 64 bit), and tilera (32 bit). On
	    other hardware gcc's builtin support for atomic memory
	    access will be used if such exists. If no such support is
	    found, <c>configure</c> will warn about no atomic
	    implementation available.</p>
          <p>
	    The <c>ethread</c> library can now also use the
	    <c>libatomic_ops</c> library for atomic memory accesses.
	    This makes it possible for the Erlang runtime system to
	    utilize optimized native atomic operations on more
	    platforms than before. If <c>configure</c> warns about no
	    atomic implementation available, try using the
	    <c>libatomic_ops</c> library. Use the <seealso
	    marker="doc/installation_guide:INSTALL#Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP">--with-libatomic_ops=PATH</seealso>
	    <c>configure</c> command line argument when specifying
	    where the <c>libatomic_ops</c> installation is located.
	    The <c>libatomic_ops</c> library can be downloaded from:
	    <url
	    href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/atomic_ops/">http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/atomic_ops/</url></p>
          <p>
	    The changed API of the <c>ethread</c> library has also
	    caused modifications in the Erlang runtime system.
	    Preparations for the to come "delayed deallocation"
	    feature has also been done since it depends on the
	    <c>ethread</c> library.</p>
          <p>
	    <em>Note</em>: When building for x86, the <c>ethread</c>
	    library will now use instructions that first appeared on
	    the pentium 4 processor. If you want the runtime system
	    to be compatible with older processors (back to 486) you
	    need to pass the <seealso
	    marker="doc/installation_guide:INSTALL#Advanced-configuration-and-build-of-ErlangOTP">--enable-ethread-pre-pentium4-compatibility</seealso>
	    <c>configure</c> command line argument when configuring
	    the system.</p>

	    <p>Support for Unicode is implemented as described in
	    EEP10. Formatting and reading of unicode data both from
	    terminals and files is supported by the io and io_lib
	    modules. Files can be opened in modes with automatic
	    translation to and from different unicode formats. The
	    module 'unicode' contains functions for conversion
	    between external and internal unicode formats and the re
	    module has support for unicode data. There is also
	    language syntax for specifying string and character data
	    beyond the ISO-latin-1 range.</p>
	    <p>The interactive shell will support input and output of
	    unicode characters when the terminal and operating system
	    supports it.</p>
	    <p>Please see the EEP and the io/io_lib manual pages as
	    well as the stdlib users guide for details.</p>
	    <p><em>I/O-protocol incompatibilities:</em></p>
	    <p>The io_protocol between io_Server and client is
	    updated to handle protocol data in unicode formats. The
	    updated protocol is now documented. The specification
	    resides in the stdlib <em>users manual</em>, which is a
	    new part of the manual.</p>
	    <p><em>io module incompatibilities:</em></p>
	    <p>The io:put_chars, io:get_chars and io:get_line all
	    handle and return unicode data. In the case where
	    binaries can be provided (as to io:put_chars), they shall
	    be encoded in UTF-8. When binaries are returned (as by
	    io:get_line/get_chars when the io_server is set in
	    <em>binary mode</em>) the returned data is also
	    <em>always</em> encoded as UTF-8. The file module however
	    still returns byte-oriented data, why file:read can be
	    used instead of io:get_chars to read binary data in
	    ISO-latin-1.</p>
	    <p><em>io_lib module incompatibilities:</em></p>
	    <p>io_lib:format can, given new format directives (i.e

	    <p>The <c>queue</c> module has been rewritten to make it
	    easier to use. Suggestions and discussion from and with
	    among others Lev Walkin, Anders Ramsell and Rober Virding
	    in december 2007 on erlang-questions@erlang.org. It was
	    also discussed to change the internal representation to
	    contain length information which would speed up
	    <c>len/1</c> but that change has been postponed. Anyone
	    interested may write an EEP and try to reach an
	    acceptable compromise for queue overhead and thereby the
	    speed of all other operations than <c>len/1</c>. The
	    <c>queue</c> module is now optimized for fast and minimal
	    garbage <c>in/2</c> and <c>out/1</c> and such. See the
	    documentation.</p>

	    to be rewritten introducing an extra QLC with the

	    <p>The behaviour of the internal functions gen:call/3,4
	    has been changed slightly in the rare case that when the
	    caller was linked to the called server, and the server
	    crashed during the call; its exit signal was consumed by
	    the gen:call/3,4 code and converted to an exit exception.
	    This exit signal is no longer consumed.</p>
	    <p>To even notice this change, 1) the calling process has
	    to be linked to the called server.</p>
          <p>
	    2) the call must not be remote by name that is it must be
	    local or remote by pid, local by name or global by name.</p>
          <p>
	    3) the calling process has to have set
	    <c>process_flag(trap_exit, true)</c>.</p>
          <p>
	    4) the server has to crash during the call.</p>
          <p>
	    5) the calling process has to be sensitive to getting
	    previously consumed <c>{'EXIT',Pid,Reason}</c> messages
	    in its message queue.</p>
	    <p>The old behaviour was once the only way for a client
	    to notice if the server died, but has since
	    <c>erlang:monitor(process, {Name,Node})</c> was
	    introduced and used in gen:call been regarded as an
	    undesired behaviour if not a bug.</p>

          <p>Support for faster join of two tables has been added
            to the <c>qlc</c> module. There are two kinds of fast
            joins: lookup join that uses existing indices, and merge
            join that takes two sorted inputs. There is a new
            <c>join</c> option that can be used to force QLC to use a
            particular kind of join in some QLC expression.</p>
          <p>Several other changes have also been included:</p>
          <list type="bulleted">
            <item>
              <p>The new <c>tmpdir</c> option of <c>cursor/2</c>,
                <c>eval/2</c>, <c>fold/4</c>, and <c>info/2</c> can be
                used to set the directory that join uses for temporary
                files. The option also overrides the <c>tmpdir</c> option
                of <c>keysort/3</c> and <c>sort/2</c>.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
              <p>The new <c>lookup</c> option can be used to
                assert that constants are looked up when evaluating some
                QLC expression.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
              <p>The <c>cache</c> and <c>cache_all</c> options
                accept new tags: <c>ets</c>, <c>list</c>, and <c>no</c>.
                The tag <c>list</c> caches answers in a list using a
                temporary file if the answers cannot be held in RAM.
                Combining <c>{cache,list}</c> and <c>{unique, true}</c>
                is equivalent to calling <c>sort/2</c> with the option
                <c>unique</c> set to <c>true</c>. The old tags
                <c>true</c> (equivalent to <c>ets</c>) and <c>false</c>
                (equivalent to <c>no</c>) are recognized for backward
                compatibility.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
              <p>The new option <c>max_list_size</c> can be used
                to set the limit where merge join starts to use temporary
                files for large equivalence classes and when answers
                cached in lists are put on temporary files.</p>
            </item>
            <item>
              <p>There is a new callback <c>is_sorted_key</c> to
                be supplied as an option to <c>table/2</c>.</p>

              <p>QLC analyzes each and every QLC expression when
                trying to find constants for the lookup function.
                Hitherto only QLC expressions with exactly one generator
                were analyzed.</p>
              <p>Note that only filters with guard
                syntax placed immediately after the generator are
                analyzed. The restriction to guard filters is an
                incompatible change. See <c>qlc(3)</c> for further
                details.</p>

            <item>
              <p>In a similar way several match specifications
                for traversal of QLC tables can be utilized for different
                generators of one single QLC expression.</p>

              <p>A bug has been fixed: when caching answers to a

        <item>
          <p>To help Dialyzer find more bugs, many functions in the
            Kernel and STDLIB applications now only accept arguments
            of the type that is documented.</p>
          <p>For instance, the functions <c>lists:prefix/2</c> and
            <c>lists:suffix/2</c> are documented to only accept lists
            as their arguments, but they actually accepted anything
            and returned <c>false</c>. That has been changed so that
            the functions cause an exception if one or both arguments
            are not lists.</p>
          <p>Also, the <c>string:strip/3</c> function is documented
            to take a character argument that is a character to strip
            from one or both ends of the string. Given a list instead
            of a character, it used to do nothing, but will now cause
            an exception.</p>
          <p>Dialyzer will find most cases where those functions
            are passed arguments of the wrong type.</p>

          <p>When given the new option '<c>strict_record_tests</c>',
            the compiler will generate code that verifies the record
            type for '<c>R#record.field</c>' operations in guards. Code
            that verifies record types in bodies has already been
            generated since R10B, but in this release there will be a
            '<c>{badrecord,RecordTag}</c>' instead of a
            '<c>badmatch</c>' if the record verification test fails.

            less information to be printed.</p>
          <p>And a somewhat more serious one also found by
            Dialyzer: <c>rpc:yield/1</c> would crash unless the call
            started by <c>rpc:async_call/4</c> had already finished;
            <c>rpc:nb_yield(Key,infinity)</c> would also crash.</p>
          <p>Cleaned up and removed redundant code found by

            that relies on <c>gb_sets:del_element/2</c> causing an

            call <c>gb_sets:delete/2</c> instead.</p>
          <p>The documentation was also updated to explicitly
            document functions that were only referred to as
