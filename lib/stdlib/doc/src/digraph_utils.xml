  <description>
    <p>This module provides algorithms based on depth-first traversal of
      directed graphs. For basic functions on directed graphs, see the
      <seealso marker="digraph"><c>digraph(3)</c></seealso> module.</p>

      <item>
        <p>A <marker id="digraph"></marker><em>directed graph</em> (or just
          "digraph") is a pair (V,&nbsp;E) of a finite set V of
          <marker id="vertex"></marker><em>vertices</em> and a finite set E of
          <marker id="edge"></marker><em>directed edges</em> (or just "edges").
          The set of edges E is a subset of V&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;V (the
          Cartesian product of V with itself).</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>Digraphs can be annotated with more information. Such information
          can be attached to the vertices and to the edges of the digraph. An
          annotated digraph is called a <em>labeled digraph</em>, and the
          information attached to a vertex or an edge is called a
          <marker id="label"></marker><em>label</em>.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>An edge e&nbsp;=&nbsp;(v,&nbsp;w) is said to
          <marker id="emanate"></marker><em>emanate</em> from vertex v and to
          be <marker id="incident"></marker><em>incident</em> on vertex w.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>If an edge is emanating from v and incident on w, then w is
          said to be an <marker id="out_neighbour"></marker>
          <em>out-neighbor</em> of v, and v is said to be an
          <marker id="in_neighbour"></marker><em>in-neighbor</em> of w.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>A <marker id="path"></marker><em>path</em> P from v[1] to v[k]
          in a digraph (V,&nbsp;E) is a non-empty sequence
          v[1],&nbsp;v[2],&nbsp;...,&nbsp;v[k] of vertices in V such that
          there is an edge (v[i],v[i+1]) in E for
          1&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;i&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;k.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>The <marker id="length"></marker><em>length</em> of path P is
          k-1.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>Path P is a <marker id="cycle"></marker><em>cycle</em> if the
          length of P is not zero and v[1] = v[k].</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>A <marker id="loop"></marker><em>loop</em> is a cycle of length
          one.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>An <marker id="acyclic_digraph"></marker><em>acyclic digraph</em>
          is a digraph without cycles.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>A <marker id="depth_first_traversal"></marker><em>depth-first
          traversal</em> of a directed digraph can be viewed as a process
          that visits all vertices of the digraph. Initially, all vertices
          are marked as unvisited. The traversal starts with an
          arbitrarily chosen vertex, which is marked as visited, and
          follows an edge to an unmarked vertex, marking that vertex. The
          search then proceeds from that vertex in the same fashion, until
          there is no edge leading to an unvisited vertex. At that point
          the process backtracks, and the traversal continues as long as
          there are unexamined edges. If unvisited vertices remain
          when all edges from the first vertex have been examined, some
          so far unvisited vertex is chosen, and the process is repeated.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>A <marker id="partial_ordering"></marker><em>partial ordering</em>
          of a set S is a transitive, antisymmetric, and reflexive relation
          between the objects of S.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>The problem of
          <marker id="topsort"></marker><em>topological sorting</em> is to find
          a total ordering of S that is a superset of the partial ordering. A
          digraph G&nbsp;=&nbsp;(V,&nbsp;E) is equivalent to a relation E
          on V (we neglect that the version of directed graphs
          provided by the <c>digraph</c> module allows multiple edges
          between vertices). If the digraph has no cycles of length two or
          more, the reflexive and transitive closure of E is a
          partial ordering.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>A <marker id="subgraph"></marker><em>subgraph</em> G' of G is a
          digraph whose vertices and edges form subsets of the vertices
          and edges of G.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>G' is <em>maximal</em> with respect to a property P if all other
          subgraphs that include the vertices of G' do not have property P.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>A <marker id="strong_components"></marker><em>strongly connected
          component</em> is a maximal subgraph such that there is a path
          between each pair of vertices.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>A <marker id="components"></marker><em>connected component</em>
          is a maximal subgraph such that there is a path between each pair of
          vertices, considering all edges undirected.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>An <marker id="arborescence"></marker><em>arborescence</em> is an
          acyclic digraph with a vertex V, the
          <marker id="root"></marker><em>root</em>, such that there is a unique
          path from V to every other vertex of G.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>A <marker id="tree"></marker><em>tree</em> is an acyclic non-empty
          digraph such that there is a unique path between every pair of
          vertices, considering all edges undirected.</p>
