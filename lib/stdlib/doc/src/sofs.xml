  <modulesummary>Functions for Manipulating Sets of Sets</modulesummary>
  <description>
    <p>The <c>sofs</c> module implements operations on finite sets and
      relations represented as sets. Intuitively, a set is a
      collection of elements; every element belongs to the set, and
      the set contains every element.</p>
    <p>Given a set A and a sentence S(x), where x is a free variable,
      a new set B whose elements are exactly those elements of A for
      which S(x) holds can be formed, this is denoted B&nbsp;=
      {x&nbsp;in&nbsp;A&nbsp;: S(x)}. Sentences are expressed using
      the logical operators "for some" (or "there exists"), "for all",
      "and", "or", "not". If the existence of a set containing all the
      specified elements is known (as will always be the case in this
      module), we write B&nbsp;= {x&nbsp;: S(x)}. </p>
    <p>The <em>unordered set</em> containing the elements a, b and c
      is denoted {a,&nbsp;b,&nbsp;c}. This notation is not to be
      confused with tuples. The <em>ordered pair</em> of a and b, with
      first <em>coordinate</em> a and second coordinate b, is denoted
      (a,&nbsp;b). An ordered pair is an <em>ordered set</em> of two
      elements. In this module ordered sets can contain one, two or
      more elements, and parentheses are used to enclose the elements.
      Unordered sets and ordered sets are orthogonal, again in this
      module; there is no unordered set equal to any ordered set.</p>
    <p>The set that contains no elements is called the <em>empty set</em>.
      If two sets A and B contain the same elements, then A 
      is <marker id="equal"></marker><em>equal</em> to B, denoted
      A&nbsp;=&nbsp;B. Two ordered sets are equal if they contain the
      same number of elements and have equal elements at each
      coordinate. If a set A contains all elements that B contains,
      then B is a <marker id="subset"></marker><em>subset</em> of A. 
      The <marker id="union"></marker><em>union</em> of two sets A and B is 
      the smallest set that contains all elements of A and all elements of
      B. The <marker id="intersection"></marker><em>intersection</em> of two
      sets A and B is the set that contains all elements of A that
      belong to B. 
      Two sets are <marker id="disjoint"></marker><em>disjoint</em> if their
      intersection is the empty set. 
      The <marker id="difference"></marker><em>difference</em> of
      two sets A and B is the set that contains all elements of A that
      do not belong to B. 
      The <marker id="symmetric_difference"></marker><em>symmetric 
      difference</em> of 
      two sets is the set that contains those element that belong to
      either of the two sets, but not both. 
      The <marker id="union_n"></marker><em>union</em> of a collection 
      of sets is the smallest set that contains all the elements that 
      belong to at least one set of the collection. 
      The <marker id="intersection_n"></marker><em>intersection</em> of 
      a non-empty collection of sets is the set that contains all elements
      that belong to every set of the collection.</p>
    <p>The <marker id="Cartesian_product"></marker><em>Cartesian 
      product</em> of
      two sets X and Y, denoted X&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;Y, is the set
      {a&nbsp;: a&nbsp;= (x,&nbsp;y) for some x&nbsp;in&nbsp;X and for
      some y&nbsp;in&nbsp;Y}. 
      A <marker id="relation"></marker><em>relation</em> is a subset of
      X&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;Y. Let R be a relation. The fact that
      (x,&nbsp;y) belongs to R is written as x&nbsp;R&nbsp;y. Since
      relations are sets, the definitions of the last paragraph
      (subset, union, and so on) apply to relations as well. 
      The <marker id="domain"></marker><em>domain</em> of R is the 
      set {x&nbsp;: x&nbsp;R&nbsp;y for some y&nbsp;in&nbsp;Y}. 
      The <marker id="range"></marker><em>range</em> of R is the 
      set {y&nbsp;: x&nbsp;R&nbsp;y for some x&nbsp;in&nbsp;X}. 
      The <marker id="converse"></marker><em>converse</em> of R is the 
      set {a&nbsp;: a&nbsp;= (y,&nbsp;x) for some 
      (x,&nbsp;y)&nbsp;in&nbsp;R}. If A is a subset of X, then 
      the <marker id="image"></marker><em>image</em> of
      A under R is the set {y&nbsp;: x&nbsp;R&nbsp;y for some
      x&nbsp;in&nbsp;A}, and if B is a subset of Y, then 
      the <marker id="inverse_image"></marker><em>inverse image</em> of B is 
      the set {x&nbsp;: x&nbsp;R&nbsp;y for some y&nbsp;in&nbsp;B}. If R is a
      relation from X to Y and S is a relation from Y to Z, then 
      the <marker id="relative_product"></marker><em>relative product</em> of
      R and S is the relation T from X to Z defined so that x&nbsp;T&nbsp;z
      if and only if there exists an element y in Y such that
      x&nbsp;R&nbsp;y and y&nbsp;S&nbsp;z. 
      The <marker id="restriction"></marker><em>restriction</em> of R to A is
      the set S defined so that x&nbsp;S&nbsp;y if and only if there exists an
      element x in A such that x&nbsp;R&nbsp;y. If S is a restriction
      of R to A, then R is 
      an <marker id="extension"></marker><em>extension</em> of S to X. 
      If X&nbsp;=&nbsp;Y then we call R a relation <em>in</em> X. 
      The <marker id="field"></marker><em>field</em> of a relation R in X
      is the union of the domain of R and the range of R. 
      If R is a relation in X, and
      if S is defined so that x&nbsp;S&nbsp;y if x&nbsp;R&nbsp;y and
      not x&nbsp;=&nbsp;y, then S is 
      the <marker id="strict_relation"></marker><em>strict</em> relation 
      corresponding to
      R, and vice versa, if S is a relation in X, and if R is defined
      so that x&nbsp;R&nbsp;y if x&nbsp;S&nbsp;y or x&nbsp;=&nbsp;y,
      then R is the <marker id="weak_relation"></marker><em>weak</em> relation
      corresponding to S. A relation R in X is <em>reflexive</em> if
      x&nbsp;R&nbsp;x for every element x of X; it is
      <em>symmetric</em> if x&nbsp;R&nbsp;y implies that
      y&nbsp;R&nbsp;x; and it is <em>transitive</em> if
      x&nbsp;R&nbsp;y and y&nbsp;R&nbsp;z imply that x&nbsp;R&nbsp;z.</p>
    <p>A <marker id="function"></marker><em>function</em> F is a relation, a
      subset of X&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;Y, such that the domain of F is
      equal to X and such that for every x in X there is a unique
      element y in Y with (x,&nbsp;y) in F. The latter condition can
      be formulated as follows: if x&nbsp;F&nbsp;y and x&nbsp;F&nbsp;z
      then y&nbsp;=&nbsp;z. In this module, it will not be required
      that the domain of F be equal to X for a relation to be
      considered a function. Instead of writing
      (x,&nbsp;y)&nbsp;in&nbsp;F or x&nbsp;F&nbsp;y, we write
      F(x)&nbsp;=&nbsp;y when F is a function, and say that F maps x
      onto y, or that the value of F at x is y. Since functions are
      relations, the definitions of the last paragraph (domain, range,
      and so on) apply to functions as well. If the converse of a
      function F is a function F', then F' is called 
      the <marker id="inverse"></marker><em>inverse</em> of F. 
      The relative product of two functions F1 and F2 is called 
      the <marker id="composite"></marker><em>composite</em> of F1 and F2
      if the range of F1 is a subset of the domain of F2. </p>
    <p>Sometimes, when the range of a function is more important than
      the function itself, the function is called a <em>family</em>.
      The domain of a family is called the <em>index set</em>, and the
      range is called the <em>indexed set</em>. If x is a family from
      I to X, then x[i] denotes the value of the function at index i.
      The notation "a family in X" is used for such a family. When the
      indexed set is a set of subsets of a set X, then we call x 
      a <marker id="family"></marker><em>family of subsets</em> of X. If x
      is a family of subsets of X, then the union of the range of x is
      called the <em>union of the family</em> x. If x is non-empty
      (the index set is non-empty), 
      the <em>intersection of the family</em> x is the intersection of 
      the range of x. In this
      module, the only families that will be considered are families
      of subsets of some set X; in the following the word "family"
      will be used for such families of subsets.</p>
    <p>A <marker id="partition"></marker><em>partition</em> of a set X is a
      collection S of non-empty subsets of X whose union is X and
      whose elements are pairwise disjoint. A relation in a set is an
      <em>equivalence relation</em> if it is reflexive, symmetric and
      transitive. If R is an equivalence relation in X, and x is an
      element of X, 
      the <marker id="equivalence_class"></marker><em>equivalence 
      class</em> of x with respect to R is the set of all those
      elements y of X for which x&nbsp;R&nbsp;y holds. The equivalence
      classes constitute a partitioning of X. Conversely, if C is a
      partition of X, then the relation that holds for any two
      elements of X if they belong to the same equivalence class, is
      an equivalence relation induced by the partition C. If R is an
      equivalence relation in X, then 
      the <marker id="canonical_map"></marker><em>canonical map</em> is
      the function that maps every element of X onto its equivalence class.
      </p>
    <p><marker id="binary_relation"></marker>Relations as defined above
      (as sets of ordered pairs) will from now on be referred to as
      <em>binary relations</em>. We call a set of ordered sets
      (x[1],&nbsp;...,&nbsp;x[n]) an <marker id="n_ary_relation"></marker>
      <em>(n-ary) relation</em>, and say that the relation is a subset of
      the <marker id="Cartesian_product_tuple"></marker>Cartesian product
      X[1]&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;...&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;X[n] where x[i] is
      an element of X[i], 1&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;i&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;n. 
      The <marker id="projection"></marker><em>projection</em> of an n-ary
      relation R onto coordinate i is the set {x[i]&nbsp;:
      (x[1],&nbsp;...,&nbsp;x[i],&nbsp;...,&nbsp;x[n]) in R for some
      x[j]&nbsp;in&nbsp;X[j], 1&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;j&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;n
      and not i&nbsp;=&nbsp;j}. The projections of a binary relation R
      onto the first and second coordinates are the domain and the
      range of R respectively. The relative product of binary
      relations can be generalized to n-ary relations as follows. Let
      TR be an ordered set (R[1],&nbsp;...,&nbsp;R[n]) of binary
      relations from X to Y[i] and S a binary relation from
      (Y[1]&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;...&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;Y[n]) to Z. 
      The <marker id="tuple_relative_product"></marker><em>relative 
      product</em> of
      TR and S is the binary relation T from X to Z defined so that
      x&nbsp;T&nbsp;z if and only if there exists an element y[i] in
      Y[i] for each 1&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;i&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;n such that
      x&nbsp;R[i]&nbsp;y[i] and
      (y[1],&nbsp;...,&nbsp;y[n])&nbsp;S&nbsp;z. Now let TR be a an
      ordered set (R[1],&nbsp;...,&nbsp;R[n]) of binary relations from
      X[i] to Y[i] and S a subset of
      X[1]&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;...&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;X[n]. 
      The <marker id="multiple_relative_product"></marker><em>multiple 
      relative product</em> of TR and S is defined to be the
      set {z&nbsp;: z&nbsp;= ((x[1],&nbsp;...,&nbsp;x[n]), (y[1],...,y[n]))
      for some (x[1],&nbsp;...,&nbsp;x[n])&nbsp;in&nbsp;S and for some
      (x[i],&nbsp;y[i]) in R[i],
      1&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;i&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;n}. 
      The <marker id="natural_join"></marker><em>natural join</em> of 
      an n-ary relation R
      and an m-ary relation S on coordinate i and j is defined to be
      the set {z&nbsp;: z&nbsp;= (x[1],&nbsp;...,&nbsp;x[n],&nbsp;
      y[1],&nbsp;...,&nbsp;y[j-1],&nbsp;y[j+1],&nbsp;...,&nbsp;y[m])
      for some (x[1],&nbsp;...,&nbsp;x[n])&nbsp;in&nbsp;R and for some
      (y[1],&nbsp;...,&nbsp;y[m])&nbsp;in&nbsp;S such that
      x[i]&nbsp;=&nbsp;y[j]}.</p>
    <p><marker id="sets_definition"></marker>The sets recognized by this 
      module will be represented by elements of the relation Sets, defined as
      the smallest set such that:</p>
    <list type="bulleted">
      <item>for every atom T except '_' and for every term X,
       (T,&nbsp;X) belongs to Sets (<em>atomic sets</em>);
      </item>
      <item>(['_'],&nbsp;[]) belongs to Sets (the <em>untyped empty set</em>);
      </item>
      <item>for every tuple T&nbsp;= {T[1],&nbsp;...,&nbsp;T[n]} and
       for every tuple X&nbsp;= {X[1],&nbsp;...,&nbsp;X[n]}, if
       (T[i],&nbsp;X[i]) belongs to Sets for every
       1&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;i&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;n then (T,&nbsp;X) belongs
       to Sets (<em>ordered sets</em>);
      </item>
      <item>for every term T, if X is the empty list or a non-empty
       sorted list [X[1],&nbsp;...,&nbsp;X[n]] without duplicates
       such that (T,&nbsp;X[i]) belongs to Sets for every
       1&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;i&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;n, then ([T],&nbsp;X)
       belongs to Sets (<em>typed unordered sets</em>).</item>
    </list>
    <p>An <marker id="external_set"></marker><em>external set</em> is an
      element of the range of Sets. 
      A <marker id="type"></marker><em>type</em>
      is an element of the domain of Sets. If S is an element
      (T,&nbsp;X) of Sets, then T is 
      a <marker id="valid_type"></marker><em>valid type</em> of X, 
      T is the type of S, and X is the external set 
      of S. <seealso marker="#from_term">from_term/2</seealso> creates a 
      set from a type and an Erlang term turned into an external set.</p>
    <p>The actual sets represented by Sets are the elements of the
      range of the function Set from Sets to Erlang terms and sets of
      Erlang terms:</p>
    <list type="bulleted">
      <item>Set(T,Term)&nbsp;= Term, where T is an atom;</item>
      <item>Set({T[1],&nbsp;...,&nbsp;T[n]},&nbsp;{X[1],&nbsp;...,&nbsp;X[n]})
       &nbsp;= (Set(T[1],&nbsp;X[1]),&nbsp;...,&nbsp;Set(T[n],&nbsp;X[n]));</item>
      <item>Set([T],&nbsp;[X[1],&nbsp;...,&nbsp;X[n]])
       &nbsp;= {Set(T,&nbsp;X[1]),&nbsp;...,&nbsp;Set(T,&nbsp;X[n])};</item>
      <item>Set([T],&nbsp;[])&nbsp;= {}.</item>
    </list>
    <p>When there is no risk of confusion, elements of Sets will be
      identified with the sets they represent. For instance, if U is
      the result of calling <c>union/2</c> with S1 and S2 as
      arguments, then U is said to be the union of S1 and S2. A more
      precise formulation would be that Set(U) is the union of Set(S1)
      and Set(S2).</p>
    <p>The types are used to implement the various conditions that
      sets need to fulfill. As an example, consider the relative
      product of two sets R and S, and recall that the relative
      product of R and S is defined if R is a binary relation to Y and
      S is a binary relation from Y. The function that implements the relative
      product, <seealso marker="#relprod_impl">relative_product/2</seealso>, checks 
      that the arguments represent binary relations by matching [{A,B}]
      against the type of the first argument (Arg1 say), and [{C,D}]
      against the type of the second argument (Arg2 say). The fact
      that [{A,B}] matches the type of Arg1 is to be interpreted as
      Arg1 representing a binary relation from X to Y, where X is
      defined as all sets Set(x) for some element x in Sets the type
      of which is A, and similarly for Y. In the same way Arg2 is
      interpreted as representing a binary relation from W to Z.
      Finally it is checked that B matches C, which is sufficient to
      ensure that W is equal to Y. The untyped empty set is handled
      separately: its type, ['_'], matches the type of any unordered
      set.</p>
    <p>A few functions of this module (<c>drestriction/3</c>,
      <c>family_projection/2</c>, <c>partition/2</c>,
      <c>partition_family/2</c>, <c>projection/2</c>,
      <c>restriction/3</c>, <c>substitution/2</c>) accept an Erlang
      function as a means to modify each element of a given unordered
      set. <marker id="set_fun"></marker>Such a function, called
      SetFun in the following, can be
      specified as a functional object (fun), a tuple
      <c>{external,&nbsp;Fun}</c>, or an integer. If SetFun is
      specified as a fun, the fun is applied to each element of the
      given set and the return value is assumed to be a set. If SetFun
      is specified as a tuple <c>{external, Fun}</c>, Fun is applied
      to the external set of each element of the given set and the
      return value is assumed to be an external set. Selecting the
      elements of an unordered set as external sets and assembling a
      new unordered set from a list of external sets is in the present
      implementation more efficient than modifying each element as a
      set. However, this optimization can only be utilized when the
      elements of the unordered set are atomic or ordered sets. It
      must also be the case that the type of the elements matches some
      clause of Fun (the type of the created set is the result of
      applying Fun to the type of the given set), and that Fun does
      nothing but selecting, duplicating or rearranging parts of the
      elements. Specifying a SetFun as an integer I is equivalent to
      specifying <c>{external, fun(X)&nbsp;-> element(I,&nbsp;X)&nbsp;end}</c>,
      but is to be preferred since it makes it possible to handle this
      case even more efficiently. Examples of SetFuns:</p>
    <pre>
fun sofs:union/1
fun(S) -> sofs:partition(1, S) end
{external, fun(A) -> A end}
{external, fun({A,_,C}) -> {C,A} end}
{external, fun({_,{_,C}}) -> C end}
{external, fun({_,{_,{_,E}=C}}) -> {E,{E,C}} end}
2</pre>
    <p>The order in which a SetFun is applied to the elements of an
      unordered set is not specified, and may change in future
      versions of sofs.</p>
    <p>The execution time of the functions of this module is dominated
      by the time it takes to sort lists. When no sorting is needed,
      the execution time is in the worst case proportional to the sum
      of the sizes of the input arguments and the returned value. A
      few functions execute in constant time: <c>from_external</c>,
      <c>is_empty_set</c>, <c>is_set</c>, <c>is_sofs_set</c>,
      <c>to_external</c>, <c>type</c>.</p>
    <p>The functions of this module exit the process with a
      <c>badarg</c>, <c>bad_function</c>, or <c>type_mismatch</c>
      message when given badly formed arguments or sets the types of
      which are not compatible.</p>
    <p>When comparing external sets the operator <c>==/2</c> is used.</p>

        <p><c>from_term</c> can be used for creating atomic or ordered
          sets. The only purpose of such a set is that of later
          building unordered sets since all functions in this module
          that <em>do</em> anything operate on unordered sets.
          Creating unordered sets from a collection of ordered sets
          may be the way to go if the ordered sets are big and one
          does not want to waste heap by rebuilding the elements of
          the unordered set. An example showing that a set can be
          built "layer by layer":</p>
        <pre>
