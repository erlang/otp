          <p>For the bit syntax, when matching with a size field that

            variable was emitted. This bug has been fixed.</p>

          <p>Guards of mach specifications are corrected to resemble
            the semantics of guards in real code more closely. The
            implementation now corresponds to the documentation in
            ERTS User's Guide. The following things are corrected:</p>

            been added to the module.</p>
          <p>WARNING the behaviour of <c>filelib:fold_files/5</c> has
            also been changed so the regexp match is tried not on
            the full name, but locally in each traversed directory.</p>

          <p>The initial shell process started in parallel with the
            <c>init</c> boot process. This made it possible to pipe
            commands to the shell that got evaluated before the system
            had booted properly. Also the shell was normally accessible
            before <c>.erlang</c> had been evaluated and this caused
            problems especially related to code loading. This has now
            been fixed so that the initial shell is not accessible
            until after the init boot routine has finished and
            <c>.erlang</c> has been evaluated. Note that the shell
            starts before any <c>-s</c> arguments are executed.</p>

        <item>
          <p>It is now possible to compile files with <c>erlc</c> without
            getting a lot of (for compilation) unnecessary code
            loaded and executed (like distribution, inet config,
            etc). <c>erlc</c> now also calls <c>erl</c> with <c>-boot start_clean</c> (so that SASL is not started even if
            <c>start_sasl</c> is default boot script).</p>

          <p>Dets tables can now be opened or closed in parallel. In
            particular, if some table is being repaired, other tables
            can still be opened or closed.</p>

          <p>The new STDLIB module <c>qlc</c> implements a query
            language with a list comprehension syntax completely
            embedded in Erlang. There is support for reading data
            from ETS, Dets, and Mnesia tables as well as for defining
            other sources of data. For easy testing queries can be
            stated in the Erlang shell. The <c>qlc</c> module aims at
            replacing Mnemosyne. See <c>qlc(3)</c> for details and
            examples.</p>

        </item>
        <item>
          <p>Some support for records has been added to the Erlang
            shell. There are commands for reading record definitions
            from files and for manipulating record definitions in the
            shell. The record syntax can be used in the shell and
            return values are printed as records when possible using
            the records definitions known to the shell. New commands
            in the shell are <c>rd/2</c>, <c>rf/0,1</c>,
            <c>rl/0,1</c>, <c>rp/1</c>, and <c>rr/1,2,3</c>. Existing
            functions in <c>user_default.erl</c> with any of these
            names need to be renamed. See <c>shell(3)</c> for further
            details.</p>

          <p><c>gen_server:abcast/2-3</c> now crashes for invalid

            <c>global</c> has been corrected. Previously,
            <c>gen_server:abcast(global,[node@host])</c> tried to
            cast to the globally registered name <c>node@host</c>,
            which is more of a bug than less. Now such a call will
            cast to the registered name <c>global</c> at the node
            <c>node@host</c> as (probably) expected.</p>
          <p>An <c>rpc:call/5</c> and <c>rpc:block_call/5</c> having a
            timeout argument has been added.</p>
          <p><c>rpc:abcast/2-3</c> has been improved not to get stuck
            waiting for connection setup if the remote node is not
            connected. In this case the send is spawned off to a
            temporary process.</p>
          <p>Two typos in the docs for module <c>calendar</c> has
            been corrected thanks to Bengt Kleberg.</p>

          <p>The code server could hang if invoked early in the startup.
            For example if the emulator was started with
            "<c>-s file eval Filename</c> and <c>Filename</c> contained
            a call to <c>code:add_patha/1</c> the code server
            accidentally tried to execute code in an unloaded module
            from inside the code that loaded a module - hence hangup.
            This bug has now been fixed.</p>
          <p>Note! Starting Erlang through code loading from a remote
            Erlang boot server will not work after this patch. It will
            be fixed in a later patch. Rumours has it that remote boot
            server code loading did not work before this patch either.
            It is not a commonly used feature.</p>
