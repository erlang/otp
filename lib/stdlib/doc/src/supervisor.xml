  <description>
    <p>A behaviour module for implementing a supervisor, a process which
      supervises other processes called child processes. A child
      process can either be another supervisor or a worker process.
      Worker processes are normally implemented using one of
      the <c>gen_event</c>, <c>gen_fsm</c>, or <c>gen_server</c>
      behaviours. A supervisor implemented using this module will have
      a standard set of interface functions and include functionality
      for tracing and error reporting. Supervisors are used to build an
      hierarchical process structure called a supervision tree, a
      nice way to structure a fault tolerant application. Refer to
      <em>OTP Design Principles</em> for more information.</p>
    <p>A supervisor assumes the definition of which child processes to
      supervise to be located in a callback module exporting a
      pre-defined set of functions.</p>
    <p>Unless otherwise stated, all functions in this module will fail
      if the specified supervisor does not exist or if bad arguments
      are given.</p>
  </description>

  <section>
    <title>Supervision Principles</title>
    <p>The supervisor is responsible for starting, stopping and
      monitoring its child processes. The basic idea of a supervisor is
      that it should keep its child processes alive by restarting them
      when necessary.</p>
    <p>The children of a supervisor is defined as a list of
      <em>child specifications</em>. When the supervisor is started, the child
      processes are started in order from left to right according to
      this list. When the supervisor terminates, it first terminates
      its child processes in reversed start order, from right to left.</p>
    <p>A supervisor can have one of the following <em>restart strategies</em>:</p>
    <list type="bulleted">
      <item>
        <p><c>one_for_one</c> - if one child process terminates and
          should be restarted, only that child process is affected.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>one_for_all</c> - if one child process terminates and
          should be restarted, all other child processes are terminated
          and then all child processes are restarted.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>rest_for_one</c> - if one child process terminates and
          should be restarted, the 'rest' of the child processes --
          i.e. the child processes after the terminated child process
          in the start order -- are terminated. Then the terminated
          child process and all child processes after it are restarted.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>simple_one_for_one</c> - a simplified <c>one_for_one</c>
          supervisor, where all child processes are dynamically added
          instances of the same process type, i.e. running the same
          code.</p>
        <p>The functions <c>delete_child/2</c>
          and <c>restart_child/2</c> are invalid for
          <c>simple_one_for_one</c> supervisors and will return
          <c>{error,simple_one_for_one}</c> if the specified supervisor
          uses this restart strategy.</p>
        <p>The function <c>terminate_child/2</c> can be used for
          children under <c>simple_one_for_one</c> supervisors by
          giving the child's <c>pid()</c> as the second argument. If
          instead the child specification identifier is used,
          <c>terminate_child/2</c> will return
          <c>{error,simple_one_for_one}</c>.</p>
        <p>Because a <c>simple_one_for_one</c> supervisor could have many
        children, it shuts them all down at same time. So, order in which they
        are stopped is not defined. For the same reason, it could have an
        overhead with regards to the <c>Shutdown</c> strategy.</p>
      </item>
    </list>
    <p>To prevent a supervisor from getting into an infinite loop of
      child process terminations and restarts, a <em>maximum restart frequency</em>
      is defined using two integer values <c>MaxR</c>
      and <c>MaxT</c>. If more than <c>MaxR</c> restarts occur within
      <c>MaxT</c> seconds, the supervisor terminates all child
      processes and then itself.
    </p>
    <marker id="child_spec"/>
    <p>This is the type definition of a child specification:</p>
    <pre>
child_spec() = {Id,StartFunc,Restart,Shutdown,Type,Modules}
 Id = term()
 StartFunc = {M,F,A}
  M = F = atom()
  A = [term()]
 Restart = permanent | transient | temporary
 Shutdown = brutal_kill | int()>0 | infinity
 Type = worker | supervisor
 Modules = [Module] | dynamic
  Module = atom()</pre>
    <list type="bulleted">
      <item>
        <p><c>Id</c> is a name that is used to identify the child
          specification internally by the supervisor.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>StartFunc</c> defines the function call used to start
          the child process. It should be a module-function-arguments
          tuple <c>{M,F,A}</c> used as <c>apply(M,F,A)</c>.</p>
        <p>The start function <em>must create and link to</em> the child
          process, and should return <c>{ok,Child}</c> or
          <c>{ok,Child,Info}</c> where <c>Child</c> is the pid of
          the child process and <c>Info</c> an arbitrary term which is
          ignored by the supervisor.</p>
        <p>The start function can also return <c>ignore</c> if the child
          process for some reason cannot be started, in which case
          the child specification will be kept by the supervisor
	  (unless it is a temporary child) but the non-existing child
	  process will be ignored.</p>
        <p>If something goes wrong, the function may also return an
          error tuple <c>{error,Error}</c>.</p>
        <p>Note that the <c>start_link</c> functions of the different
          behaviour modules fulfill the above requirements.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>Restart</c> defines when a terminated child process
          should be restarted. A <c>permanent</c> child process should
          always be restarted, a <c>temporary</c> child process should
          never be restarted (even when the supervisor's restart strategy
          is <c>rest_for_one</c> or <c>one_for_all</c> and a sibling's
          death causes the temporary process to be terminated) and a
          <c>transient</c> child process should be restarted only if
          it terminates abnormally, i.e. with another exit reason
          than <c>normal</c>, <c>shutdown</c> or <c>{shutdown,Term}</c>.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>Shutdown</c> defines how a child process should be
          terminated. <c>brutal_kill</c> means the child process will
          be unconditionally terminated using <c>exit(Child,kill)</c>.
          An integer timeout value means that the supervisor will tell
          the child process to terminate by calling
          <c>exit(Child,shutdown)</c> and then wait for an exit signal
          with reason <c>shutdown</c> back from the child process. If
          no exit signal is received within the specified number of milliseconds,
          the child process is unconditionally terminated using
          <c>exit(Child,kill)</c>.</p>
        <p>If the child process is another supervisor, <c>Shutdown</c>
          should be set to <c>infinity</c> to give the subtree ample
          time to shutdown. It is also allowed to set it to <c>infinity</c>,
          if the child process is a worker.</p>
        <warning>
          <p>Be careful by setting the <c>Shutdown</c> strategy to
          <c>infinity</c> when the child process is a worker. Because, in this
          situation, the termination of the supervision tree depends on the
          child process, it must be implemented in a safe way and its cleanup
          procedure must always return.</p>
        </warning>
        <p>Note that all child processes implemented using the standard
          OTP behavior modules automatically adhere to the shutdown
          protocol.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>Type</c> specifies if the child process is a supervisor or
          a worker.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p><c>Modules</c> is used by the release handler during code
          replacement to determine which processes are using a certain
          module. As a rule of thumb <c>Modules</c> should be a list
          with one element <c>[Module]</c>, where <c>Module</c> is
          the callback module, if the child process is a supervisor,
          gen_server or gen_fsm. If the child process is an event
          manager (gen_event) with a dynamic set of callback modules,
          <c>Modules</c> should be <c>dynamic</c>. See <em>OTP Design Principles</em>
          for more information about release handling.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>Internally, the supervisor also keeps track of the pid

        <p>Creates a supervisor process as part of a supervision tree.
          The function will, among other things, ensure that
          the supervisor is linked to the calling process (its
          supervisor).</p>
        <p>The created supervisor process calls <c><anno>Module</anno>:init/1</c> to
          find out about restart strategy, maximum restart frequency
          and child processes. To ensure a synchronized start-up
          procedure, <c>start_link/2,3</c> does not return until
          <c><anno>Module</anno>:init/1</c> has returned and all child processes
          have been started.</p>
        <p>If <c><anno>SupName</anno>={local,Name}</c> the supervisor is registered

          <c><anno>SupName</anno>={global,Name}</c> the supervisor is registered
          globally as <c>Name</c> using <c>global:register_name/2</c>. If
          <c><anno>SupName</anno>={via,<anno>Module</anno>,<anno>Name</anno>}</c> the supervisor
	  is registered as <c>Name</c> using the registry represented by
	  <c>Module</c>. The <c>Module</c> callback should export the functions
	  <c>register_name/2</c>, <c>unregister_name/1</c> and <c>send/2</c>,
	  which should behave like the corresponding functions in <c>global</c>.
	  Thus, <c>{via,global,<anno>Name</anno>}</c> is a valid reference.</p>
          <p>If no name is provided, the supervisor is not registered.</p>
        <p><c><anno>Module</anno></c> is the name of the callback module.</p>
        <p><c><anno>Args</anno></c> is an arbitrary term which is passed as

        <p>If the supervisor and its child processes are successfully
          created (i.e. if all child process start functions return
          <c>{ok,Child}</c>, <c>{ok,Child,Info}</c>, or <c>ignore</c>)
          the function returns <c>{ok,Pid}</c>, where <c>Pid</c> is
          the pid of the supervisor. If there already exists a process
          with the specified <c><anno>SupName</anno></c> the function returns
          <c>{error,{already_started,Pid}}</c>, where <c>Pid</c> is
          the pid of that process.</p>
        <p>If <c><anno>Module</anno>:init/1</c> returns <c>ignore</c>, this function
          returns <c>ignore</c> as well and the supervisor terminates

          If <c><anno>Module</anno>:init/1</c> fails or returns an incorrect value,
          this function returns <c>{error,Term}</c> where <c>Term</c>
          is a term with information about the error, and the supervisor
          terminates with reason <c>Term</c>.</p>
        <p>If any child process start function fails or returns an error
          tuple or an erroneous value, the supervisor will first terminate

          specification.</p>
        <p>If the case of a <c>simple_one_for_one</c> supervisor,
          the child specification defined in <c>Module:init/1</c> will

        <p>Whenever a supervisor is started using
          <c>supervisor:start_link/2,3</c>, this function is called by
          the new process to find out about restart strategy, maximum
          restart frequency and child specifications.</p>
        <p><c>Args</c> is the <c>Args</c> argument provided to the start
          function.</p>
        <p><c>RestartStrategy</c> is the restart strategy and
          <c>MaxR</c> and <c>MaxT</c> defines the maximum restart
          frequency of the supervisor. <c>[ChildSpec]</c> is a list of
          valid child specifications defining which child processes
          the supervisor should start and monitor. See the discussion
          about Supervision Principles above.</p>
        <p>Note that when the restart strategy is
          <c>simple_one_for_one</c>, the list of child specifications
          must be a list with one child specification only.
          (The <c>Id</c> is ignored). No child process is then started
          during the initialization phase, but all children are assumed
          to be started dynamically using
          <c>supervisor:start_child/2</c>.</p>
        <p>The function may also return <c>ignore</c>.</p>
