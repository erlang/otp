  <modulesummary>A Functional Interface to System Messages</modulesummary>
  <description>
    <p>This module contains functions for sending system messages used by programs, and messages used for debugging purposes.
      </p>
    <p>Functions used for implementation of processes 
      should also understand system messages such as debugging
      messages and code change. These functions must be used to implement the use of system messages for a process; either directly, or through standard behaviours, such as <c>gen_server</c>.</p>
    <p>The default timeout is 5000 ms, unless otherwise specified. The
      <c>timeout</c> defines the time period to wait for the process to
      respond to a request. If the process does not respond, the
      function evaluates <c>exit({timeout, {M, F, A}})</c>.
      </p>
    <p><marker id="dbg_opt"/>The functions make reference to a debug structure.
      The debug structure is a list of <c>dbg_opt()</c>.
      <c>dbg_opt()</c> is an internal data type used by the
      <c>handle_system_msg/6</c> function. No debugging is performed if it is an empty list.
      </p>
  </description>

  <section>
    <title>System Messages</title>
    <p>Processes which are not implemented as one of the standard
      behaviours must still understand system
      messages. There are three different messages which must be
      understood:
      </p>
    <list type="bulleted">
      <item>
        <p>Plain system messages. These are received as
          <c>{system, From, Msg}</c>. The content and meaning of
          this message are not interpreted by the
          receiving process module. When a system message has been
          received, the function <c>sys:handle_system_msg/6</c>
          is called in order to handle the request.
          </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>Shutdown messages. If the process traps exits, it must
          be able to handle an shut-down request from its parent, the
          supervisor. The message <c>{'EXIT', Parent, Reason}</c>
          from the parent is an order to terminate.  The process must terminate when this message is received, normally with the
          same <c>Reason</c> as <c>Parent</c>.
          </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>There is one more message which the process must understand if the modules used to implement the process change dynamically during runtime. An example of such a process is the <c>gen_event</c> processes. This message is <c>{get_modules, From}</c>. The reply to this message is <c>From ! {modules, Modules}</c>,
          where <c>Modules</c> is a list of the currently active modules in the process.
          </p>
        <p>This message is used by the release handler to find which
          processes execute a certain module. The process may at a
          later time be suspended and ordered to perform a code change
          for one of its modules.
          </p>
      </item>
    </list>

  <section>
    <title>System Events</title>
    <p>When debugging a process with the functions of this
      module, the process generates <em>system_events</em> which are
      then treated in the debug function. For example, <c>trace</c>
      formats the system events to the tty.
      </p>
    <p>There are three predefined system events which are used when a
      process receives or sends a message. The process can also define its
      own system events. It is always up to the process itself
      to format these events.</p>

        <p>Gets the state of the process.</p>
        <note>
          <p>These functions are intended only to help with debugging. They are provided for
            convenience, allowing developers to avoid having to create their own state extraction
            functions and also avoid having to interactively extract state from the return values of
            <c><seealso marker="#get_status-1">get_status/1</seealso></c> or
            <c><seealso marker="#get_status-2">get_status/2</seealso></c> while debugging.</p>
        </note>
        <p>The value of <c><anno>State</anno></c> varies for different types of
          processes. For a <c>gen_server</c> process, the returned <c><anno>State</anno></c>
          is simply the callback module's state. For a <c>gen_fsm</c> process,
          <c><anno>State</anno></c> is the tuple <c>{CurrentStateName, CurrentStateData}</c>.
          For a <c>gen_event</c> process, <c><anno>State</anno></c> a list of tuples,
          where each tuple corresponds to an event handler registered in the process and contains
          <c>{Module, Id, HandlerState}</c>, where <c>Module</c> is the event handler's module name,
          <c>Id</c> is the handler's ID (which is the value <c>false</c> if it was registered without
          an ID), and <c>HandlerState</c> is the handler's state.</p>
        <p>If the callback module exports a <c>system_get_state/1</c> function, it will be called in the
          target process to get its state. Its argument is the same as the <c>Misc</c> value returned by
          <seealso marker="#get_status-1">get_status/1,2</seealso>, and the <c>system_get_state/1</c>
          function is expected to extract the callback module's state from it. The <c>system_get_state/1</c>
          function must return <c>{ok, State}</c> where <c>State</c> is the callback module's state.</p>
        <p>If the callback module does not export a <c>system_get_state/1</c> function, <c>get_state/1,2</c>
          assumes the <c>Misc</c> value is the callback module's state and returns it directly instead.</p>
        <p>If the callback module's <c>system_get_state/1</c> function crashes or throws an exception, the
          caller exits with error <c>{callback_failed, {Module, system_get_state}, {Class, Reason}}</c> where
          <c>Module</c> is the name of the callback module and <c>Class</c> and <c>Reason</c> indicate
          details of the exception.</p>
        <p>The <c>system_get_state/1</c> function is primarily useful for user-defined
          behaviours and modules that implement OTP <seealso marker="#special_process">special
          processes</seealso>. The <c>gen_server</c>, <c>gen_fsm</c>, and <c>gen_event</c> OTP
          behaviour modules export this function, and so callback modules for those behaviours
          need not supply their own.</p>

      <desc>
        <p>Replaces the state of the process, and returns the new state.</p>
        <note>
          <p>These functions are intended only to help with debugging, and they should not be
            be called from normal code. They are provided for convenience, allowing developers
            to avoid having to create their own custom state replacement functions.</p>
        </note>
        <p>The <c><anno>StateFun</anno></c> function provides a new state for the process.
          The <c><anno>State</anno></c> argument and <c><anno>NewState</anno></c> return value
          of <c><anno>StateFun</anno></c> vary for different types of processes. For a
          <c>gen_server</c> process, <c><anno>State</anno></c> is simply the callback module's
          state, and <c><anno>NewState</anno></c> is a new instance of that state. For a
          <c>gen_fsm</c> process, <c><anno>State</anno></c> is the tuple
          <c>{CurrentStateName, CurrentStateData}</c>, and <c><anno>NewState</anno></c>
          is a similar tuple that may contain a new state name, new state data, or both.
          For a <c>gen_event</c> process, <c><anno>State</anno></c> is the tuple
          <c>{Module, Id, HandlerState}</c> where <c>Module</c> is the event handler's module name,
          <c>Id</c> is the handler's ID (which is the value <c>false</c> if it was registered without
          an ID), and <c>HandlerState</c> is the handler's state. <c><anno>NewState</anno></c> is a
          similar tuple where <c>Module</c> and <c>Id</c> shall have the same values as in
          <c><anno>State</anno></c> but the value of <c>HandlerState</c> may be different. Returning
          a <c><anno>NewState</anno></c> whose <c>Module</c> or <c>Id</c> values differ from those of
          <c><anno>State</anno></c> will result in the event handler's state remaining unchanged. For a
          <c>gen_event</c> process, <c><anno>StateFun</anno></c> is called once for each event handler
          registered in the <c>gen_event</c> process.</p>
        <p>If a <c><anno>StateFun</anno></c> function decides not to effect any change in process
          state, then regardless of process type, it may simply return its <c><anno>State</anno></c>
          argument.</p>
        <p>If a <c><anno>StateFun</anno></c> function crashes or throws an exception, then
          for <c>gen_server</c> and <c>gen_fsm</c> processes, the original state of the process is
          unchanged. For <c>gen_event</c> processes, a crashing or failing <c><anno>StateFun</anno></c>
          function means that only the state of the particular event handler it was working on when it
          failed or crashed is unchanged; it can still succeed in changing the states of other event
          handlers registered in the same <c>gen_event</c> process.</p>
        <p>If the callback module exports a <c>system_replace_state/2</c> function, it will be called in the
          target process to replace its state using <c>StateFun</c>. Its two arguments are <c>StateFun</c>
          and <c>Misc</c>, where <c>Misc</c> is the same as the <c>Misc</c> value returned by
          <seealso marker="#get_status-1">get_status/1,2</seealso>. A <c>system_replace_state/2</c> function
          is expected to return <c>{ok, NewState, NewMisc}</c> where <c>NewState</c> is the callback module's
          new state obtained by calling <c>StateFun</c>, and <c>NewMisc</c> is a possibly new value used to
          replace the original <c>Misc</c> (required since <c>Misc</c> often contains the callback
          module's state within it).</p>
        <p>If the callback module does not export a <c>system_replace_state/2</c> function,
          <c>replace_state/2,3</c> assumes the <c>Misc</c> value is the callback module's state, passes it
          to <c>StateFun</c> and uses the return value as both the new state and as the new value of
          <c>Misc</c>.</p>
        <p>If the callback module's <c>system_replace_state/2</c> function crashes or throws an exception,
          the caller exits with error <c>{callback_failed, {Module, system_replace_state}, {Class, Reason}}</c>
          where <c>Module</c> is the name of the callback module and <c>Class</c> and <c>Reason</c> indicate details
          of the exception. If the callback module does not provide a <c>system_replace_state/2</c> function and
          <c>StateFun</c> crashes or throws an exception, the caller exits with error
          <c>{callback_failed, StateFun, {Class, Reason}}</c>.</p>
        <p>The <c>system_replace_state/2</c> function is primarily useful for user-defined behaviours and
          modules that implement OTP <seealso marker="#special_process">special processes</seealso>. The
          <c>gen_server</c>, <c>gen_fsm</c>, and <c>gen_event</c> OTP behaviour modules export this function,

      <desc>
        <p>This function is used by a process module that wishes to take care of system
          messages. The process receives a <c>{system, <anno>From</anno>, <anno>Msg</anno>}</c>
          message and passes the <c><anno>Msg</anno></c> and <c><anno>From</anno></c> to this
          function.
          </p>
        <p>This function <em>never</em> returns. It calls the function
          <c><anno>Module</anno>:system_continue(<anno>Parent</anno>, NDebug, <anno>Misc</anno>)</c> where the
          process continues the execution, or
          <c><anno>Module</anno>:system_terminate(Reason, <anno>Parent</anno>, <anno>Debug</anno>, <anno>Misc</anno>)</c> if
          the process should terminate. The <c><anno>Module</anno></c> must export

          </p>
        <p>The <c><anno>Misc</anno></c> argument can be used to save internal data
          in a process, for example its state. It is sent to
