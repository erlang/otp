# STDLIB Release Notes

This document describes the changes made to the STDLIB application.

## STDLIB 6.1.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Remove whitespace stripping of returned binaries in `json:decode/3`.

  Own Id: OTP-19227 Aux Id: ERIERL-1130, [PR-8809]

- Fix `zip:unzip/2` to not crash when extracting zip files with garbage in the Zip64 extra header. This bug was introduced in Erlang 27.1 and has so far only been seen on some archives creates by MS Excel.

  Own Id: OTP-19241 Aux Id: [PR-8836]

- With this change, shutdown procedure handles a race condition between supervisor executing a shutdown and child process termination from other reason.

  Own Id: OTP-19256 Aux Id: [PR-8780]

[PR-8809]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/8809
[PR-8836]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/8836
[PR-8780]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/8780

## STDLIB 6.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- The help printout for incorrect `t:io:format/0` strings now handles the `k` modifier correctly.

  Own Id: OTP-19146 Aux Id: [PR-8611] [GH-8568]

- Fixed a bug that caused the shell completion to crash when keyword and tuple appeared on the same line.

  Own Id: OTP-19157 Aux Id: [PR-8638]

- Due to PR-7419/OTP-18671, the cached internal value of the `callback_mode` started leaking out to `logger` reports, which could cause `logger` handlers to crash.  This has now been fixed to show the value that was set, as before caching.

  Own Id: OTP-19164 Aux Id: [GH-8605], [PR-7419], OTP-18671

- Fixed an emulator crash relating to compressed ETS tables.

  Own Id: OTP-19176 Aux Id: [PR-8683]

- The error description for `maps:update/3` will no longer insist that the third argument is not a map when a key could not be found

  Own Id: OTP-19189

- Multiple issues have been corrected in the markdown parser that creates documentation for the shell. 
  
  The parser was incorrectly parsing formatted markdown (either bold or italics) within parenthesis. This used to not be shown correctly in the shell documentation `(_Option._)`, which was displayed verbatim. This fix makes `Option.` to appear in italics.
  
  The markdown parser is also used in the creation of other documentation formats, so this was a bug that affected other generated documentation formats.

  Own Id: OTP-19200 Aux Id: [GH-8738], [PR-8739]

- Fixed category for some codepoint ranges in `unicode_util`.

  Own Id: OTP-19210 Aux Id: [GH-8748]

- Fixed `m:argparse` to print sub-commands help when available.

  *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

  Own Id: OTP-19202 Aux Id: [PR-8261], [GH-8715], [PR-8741]

- The `m:zip` module has been updated with support for:
  
  * zip64 archives - Archives larger than 4GB or with more than 2^32 entries.
  * extended timestamps - Higher resolution and in UTC.
  * UID/GID - Save and extract the original UID/GID.
  * Fixes so that permission mode attributes are correctly read and set for files in archives.
  * `zip:list_dir/2` now also returns directories, not only files. (You can disable this behaviour by using the option `skip_directories`).
  
  Various bugs in the original implementation have also been fixed, such as:
  
  * Correctly encode and decode the DOS timestamps for entries within an archive (that is the non-extended timestamp).
  * Fix DOS timestamps to be set to localtime instead of UTC (use extended timestamps for UTC timestamps).
  * Use the unix file attributes read from disk when creating archives instead of setting everything to 644.

## STDLIB 6.0.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fix so that missing `-doc({file, File})` files only result in a warning and not an error.

  Own Id: OTP-19099 Aux Id: [PR-8542]

- Fixed `m:json` bugs, `json:encode_key_value_list/2` did not generate arrays and `json:decode/3` did not invoke the user callback for `0`.

  Own Id: OTP-19106 Aux Id: [PR-8581] [GH-8580] [PR-8519]

[PR-8519]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/8519

## STDLIB 6.0

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- The specs in module `m:binary` has been updated to reflect what is allowed by the documentation.

  Own Id: OTP-18684 Aux Id: [PR-7481]

- Several functions in the `m:binary` module would accept arguments of the wrong type under certain circumstances. In this release, they now raise an exception when incorrect types are given.
  
  The following functions would accept an invalid pattern if the subject binary was empty or if the `{scope,{0,0}}` option was given:
  [`binary:match/2,3`](`binary:match/3`),
  [`binary:matches/2,3`](`binary:matches/2`),
  [`binary:replace/3,4`](`binary:replace/3`), and
  [`binary:split/2,3`](`binary:split/2`)
  
  The call `binary:copy(<<1:1>>, 0)` would return an empty binary instead of raising an exception. Similarly, calls to [`binary:part/2,3`](`binary:part/2`) attempting to extract 0 bytes at position 0 of a bitstring would return an empty binary instead of raising an exception.

  Own Id: OTP-18743 Aux Id: [PR-7607], [PR-7628]

- The documentation for the preprocessor now mentions that `defined(Name)` can be called in the condition for an `-if` or `-elif` directive to test whether `Name` is the name of a defined macro. (This feature was implemented in OTP 21.)
  
  If a function call in an `-if` or `-elif` with a name that is not the name of a guard BIF, there would not be a compilation error, but would instead cause the lines following the directive to be skipped. This has now been changed to be a compilation error.

  *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

  Own Id: OTP-18784 Aux Id: [GH-7706], [PR-7726]

- `get_until` requests using the I/O protocol now correctly return a binary or list when `eof` is the last item returned by the callback.

  Own Id: OTP-18930 Aux Id: [PR-7993], [GH-4992]

- The error handling the `simple_one_for_one` supervisor has been enhanced. A transient child returning `ignore` will no longer cause a crash.
  
  Also, automatic shutdown has been disabled because it does not make sense for this supervisor type. That is was allowed is considered a bug. Therefore, we don't consider this an incompatible change.

  *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

  Own Id: OTP-19029 Aux Id: [PR-8230]

- Fix shell expansion to not crash when expanding a map with non-atom keys and to not list zero arity functions when an argument has been given.

  Own Id: OTP-19073 Aux Id: [PR-8375] [GH-8366] [GH-8365] [GH-8364]

[PR-7481]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/7481
[PR-7607]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/7607
[PR-7628]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/7628

[GH-8365]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues/8365
[GH-8364]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues/8364

### Improvements and New Features

- The functions [`is_equal/2`](`sets:is_equal/2`), [`map/2`](`sets:map/2`), and [`filtermap/2`](`sets:filtermap/2`) have been added to the modules `m:sets`, `m:ordsets`, and `m:gb_sets`.

  Own Id: OTP-18622 Aux Id: [PR-7183], [PR-7232]

- The compiler now emits nicer error message for function head mismatches.
  For example, given:
  
  ```erlang
  a() -> ok;
  a(_) -> error.
  ```
  
  Erlang/OTP 26 and earlier would emit a diagnostic similar to:
  
  ```text
  t.erl:6:1: head mismatch
  %    6| a(_) -> error.
  %     | ^
  ```
  
  while in Erlang/OTP 27 the diagnostic is similar to:
  
  ```text
  t.erl:6:1: head mismatch: function a with arities 0 and 1 is regarded as two distinct functions. Is the number of arguments incorrect or is the semicolon in a/0 unwanted?
  %    6| a(_) -> error.
  %     | ^
  ```

  Own Id: OTP-18648 Aux Id: [PR-7383]

- [`zip:create/2,3`](`zip:create/2`) will now tolerate POSIX timestamps in the provided `file_info` records.

  Own Id: OTP-18668

- The callback function `c:gen_statem:handle_event/4` has been cached in the `gen_statem` engine to optimize callback call speed.

  Own Id: OTP-18671 Aux Id: [PR-7419]

- The type `beam_lib:beam/0` is now exported.

  Own Id: OTP-18716 Aux Id: [PR-7534]

- The documentation for the `m:binary` module has been improved.

  Own Id: OTP-18741 Aux Id: [PR-7585]

- [`binary:replace/3,4`](`binary:replace/3`) now supports using a fun for supplying the replacement binary.

  Own Id: OTP-18742 Aux Id: [PR-7590]

- Triple-Quoted Strings has been implemented as per [EEP 64](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0064). See [String](`e:system:data_types.md#string`) in the Reference Manual.
  
  Example:
  
  ```erlang
  1> """
     a
     b
     c
     """.
  "a\nb\nc"
  ```
  
  Adjacent string literals without intervening white space is now a syntax error, to avoid possible confusion with triple-quoted strings. For example:
  
  ```erlang
  1> "abc""xyz".
  "xyz".
  * 1:6: adjacent string literals without intervening white space
  ```

  *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

  Own Id: OTP-18750 Aux Id: OTP-18746, [PR-7313], [PR-7451]

- The new function `proc_lib:set_label/1` can be used to add a descriptive term to any process that does not have a registered name. The name will be shown by tools such as `\c:i/0`, `m:observer`, and it will be included in crash reports produced by processes using `m:gen_server`, `m:gen_statem`, `m:gen_event`, and `m:gen_fsm`.
  
  The label for a process can be retrieved by calling `proc_lib:get_label/1`.
  
  Note that those functions work on any process, not only processes that use `m:proc_lib`.
  
  Example:
  
  ```text
  1> self().
  <0.90.0>
  2> proc_lib:set_label(my_label).
  ok
  3> i().
      .
      .
      .
  <0.90.0>              erlang:apply/2                        2586    75011    0
  my_label              c:pinfo/2                               51
  4> proc_lib:get_label(self()).
  my_label
  ```

  Own Id: OTP-18789 Aux Id: [PR-7720], [PR-8003]

- `-callback` attributes has been added to modules `m:sys` and `m:erl_error`.

  Own Id: OTP-18793 Aux Id: [PR-7703]

- Several new functions that accept funs have been added to module `m:timer`.
  
  Functions [`apply_after/2`](`timer:apply_after/2`), [`apply_interval/2`](`timer:apply_interval/2`), and [`apply_repeatedly/2`](`apply_repeatedly/2`) accept a nullary fun as the second argument, while  functions [`apply_after/3`](`timer:apply_after/3`), [`apply_interval/3`](`timer:apply_interval/3`), and [`apply_repeatedly/3`](`apply_repeatedly/3`) accept an n-ary fun as the second and a list of n arguments for the fun as the third argument.

  Own Id: OTP-18808 Aux Id: [PR-7649]

- Sigils on string literals have been implemented as per [EEP 66](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0066), that is: binary and string sigils in verbatim and escape characters variants, as well as a default (vanilla) Sigil.  All for ordinary strings and for triple-quoted strings (EEP 64). See [Sigils in the Reference Manual](`e:system:data_types.md#sigil`).
  
  Examples:
  
  ```erlang
  1> ~"Björn".
  <<"Björn"/utf8>>
  2> ~b"Björn".
  <<"Björn"/utf8>>
  3> ~S"\s*(\w+)".
  "\\s*(\\w+)"
  4> ~B"\s*(\w+)".
  <<"\\s*(\\w+)">>
  ```

  Own Id: OTP-18825 Aux Id: OTP-18750, [PR-7684]

- Functions `shell:default_multiline_prompt/1`, `shell:inverted_space_prompt/1`, and 
  `shell:prompt_width/1` have been exported to help with custom prompt implementations.

  Own Id: OTP-18834 Aux Id: [PR-7675] [PR-7816]

- The shell now pages long output from the documentation help command ([`h(Module)`](`c:h/1`)), auto completions and the search command.

  Own Id: OTP-18846 Aux Id: [PR-7845]

- The `M-h` hotkey (Alt/Option-h) now outputs help for the module or function directly before the cursor.

  Own Id: OTP-18847 Aux Id: [PR-7846]

- Added support for adding a custom code formatter that formats your multi-line shell commands in your preferred formatting on submission. See `shell:format_shell_func/` and `shell:erl_pp_format_func/1`.

  Own Id: OTP-18848 Aux Id: [PR-7847]

- Added shell functions for viewing, forgetting and saving locally defined functions, types and records.

  Own Id: OTP-18852 Aux Id: [PR-7844]

- Added `string:jaro_similarity/2`, which can be used to calculate the similarity between two strings.

  Own Id: OTP-18865 Aux Id: [PR-7879]

- The new function `ets:update_element/4` is similar to `ets:update_element/3`, but takes a default tuple as the fourth argument, which will be inserted if no previous record with that key exists.

  Own Id: OTP-18870 Aux Id: [PR-7857]

- Added functions to retrieve the next higher or lower key/element from `m:gb_trees` and `m:gb_sets`, as well as returning iterators that start at given keys/elements.

  Own Id: OTP-18874 Aux Id: [PR-7745]

- When the shell built-in function [`c/1,2`][c12] is used to re-compile a module, the current working directory of the original compilation is now added to the include path.
  
  [c12]: `\c:c/1`

  Own Id: OTP-18908 Aux Id: [PR-7957]

- The `timer` module now uses a private table for its internal state, slightly improving its performance.

  Own Id: OTP-18914 Aux Id: [PR-7973]

- [EEP-59 - Documentation Attributes](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0059) has been implemented.
  
  Documentation attributes can be used to document functions, types, callbacks, and modules.
  The keyword `-moduledoc "Documentation here".` is used to document modules, while `-doc "Documentation here".` can be used on top of functions, types, and callbacks to document them, respectively.
  
  * Types, callbacks, and function documentation can be set to `hidden` either via `-doc false` or `-doc hidden`. When documentation attributes mark a type as hidden, they will not be part of the documentation.
  
  * The documentation from `moduledoc` and `doc` gets added by default to the binary beam file, following the format of [EEP-48](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0048).
  
  * Using the compiler flag `warn_missing_doc` will raise a warning when
  `-doc` attributes are missing in exported functions, types, and callbacks.
  
  * Using the compiler flag `warn_missing_spec_documented` will raise a warning when
  spec attributes are missing in documented functions, types, and callbacks.
  
  * `moduledoc`s and `doc`s may refer to external files to be embedded, such as `-doc {file, "README.md"}.`, which refers to the file `README.md` found in the current working directory.
  
  * The compiler warns about exported functions whose specs refer to hidden types. Thus, there will be warnings when a hidden type (meaning, the type is not part of the documentation) gets used in an exported function.

  Own Id: OTP-18916 Aux Id: [PR-7936]

- New `m:ets` functions `ets:first_lookup/1`, `ets:next_lookup/2`, `ets:prev_lookup/2` and `ets:last_lookup/1`. Example: `ets:next_lookup/1` is equivalent to `ets:next/2` followed by `ets:lookup/2` with the next key. The new combined functions are more efficient and with guaranteed atomicity.

  Own Id: OTP-18923 Aux Id: [PR-6791]

- The `maybe` expression is now enabled by default.
  
  To use `maybe` as an atom, it needs to be single-quoted. Alternatively, the `maybe` expression can be disabled by disabling the `maybe_expr` feature. That can be done by placing the following the line at the beginning of an Erlang source file:
  
  ```erlang
  -feature(maybe_expr, disable).
  ```
  
  Another way to disable the `maybe_expr` feature is by passing the `-disable-feature` option to `erlc`:
  
  ```text
  erlc -disable-feature maybe_expr some_file.erl
  ```

  Own Id: OTP-18944 Aux Id: [PR-8067]

- The compiler will now raise a warning when updating record/map literals. As an example, consider this module:
  
  ```erlang
  -module(t).
  -export([f/0]).
  -record(r, {a,b,c}).
  
  f() ->
      #r{a=1}#r{b=2}.
  ```
  
  The compiler raises the following warning:
  
  ```text
  1> c(t).
  t.erl:6:12: Warning: expression updates a literal
  %    6|     #r{a=1}#r{b=2}.
  %     |            ^
  ```

  Own Id: OTP-18951 Aux Id: [PR-8069]

- The documentation has been migrated to use Markdown and ExDoc.

  Own Id: OTP-18955 Aux Id: [PR-8026]

- Optimized `ets:foldl` and `ets:foldr` to use new `ets:next_lookup`. Also made them immune against table renaming.

  Own Id: OTP-18993 Aux Id: [PR-8048]

- Windows now supports all functions in `m:math`.

  Own Id: OTP-19001 Aux Id: [PR-8164]

- `m:erl_lint` (and by extension the [`compiler`](`m:compile`)) will now warn for code using deprecated callbacks.
  
  The only callback currenly deprecated is `format_status/2` in [`gen_server`](`c:gen_server:format_status/2`), [`gen_event`](`c:gen_event:format_status/2`) and [`gen_statem`](`c:gen_server:format_status/2`).
  
  You can use `nowarn_deprecated_callback` to silence the warning.

  Own Id: OTP-19010 Aux Id: [PR-8205]

- There is a new module [`json`](`m:json`) for encoding and decoding [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).
  
  Both encoding and decoding can be customized. Decoding can be done in a SAX-like fashion and handle multiple documents and streams of data.

## STDLIB 5.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Make `shell_docs` correctly trim the newline at the end of code blocks.

  Own Id: OTP-18777 Aux Id: PR-7663

- Replaced unintentional Erlang Public License 1.1 headers in some files with
  the intended Apache License 2.0 header.

  Own Id: OTP-18815 Aux Id: PR-7780

- Fixed a bug where autocompletion could crash the shell when trying to expand a
  nested tuple.

  Own Id: OTP-18822 Aux Id: PR-7796

- Removed auto closing feature, in autocompletion, for function arguments,
  tuples, records and maps, since this could interfere with autocompletion of
  atoms.

  Own Id: OTP-18823

- Fixed a bug where autocompletion string formatting would remove suggestions
  that had the same name but different case.

  Own Id: OTP-18824

  instead of a whole word.

  Own Id: OTP-18826 Aux Id: PR-7797

- Fix so that its possible to override the default keyboard shortcuts for the
  shell.

  Own Id: OTP-18866 Aux Id: GH-7875, PR-7878

### Improvements and New Features

- The warning for accidental use of a future triple-quoted string delimiter has
  been upgraded to instead warn for adjacent strings without intervening white
  space, which effectively is the same at a string start, but also covers the
  same situation at a string end.

  Own Id: OTP-18821 Aux Id: OTP-18746

- The removal of the deprecated `slave` module, originally planned for OTP 27,
  has been postponed to OTP 29.

  Own Id: OTP-18840 Aux Id: PR-7629

- Guards have been added to `gen_*:start*` API functions to catch bad arguments
  earlier. Before this change, in some cases, a bad argument could tag along and
  cause the server to fail later, right after start.

## STDLIB 5.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- The compiler could run forever when compiling a call to
  [`is_record/3`](`is_record/3`) with a huge positive tuple size. The call
  [`is_record(A, a, 0)`](`is_record/3`) would crash the compiler when used in a
  function body. When used in a guard the compiler would emit incorrect code
  that would accept `{a>` as a record.

  Own Id: OTP-18605 Aux Id: GH-7298, GH-7317

- Fix bug in `ets:tab2file` that could make it fail if another Erlang process
  created the same file at the same time.

  Own Id: OTP-18614 Aux Id: GH-7162, PR-7237

- An `{else_clause,Value}` exception will now be reported nicely in the shell.

  Own Id: OTP-18616 Aux Id: GH-7258

- Correct return value for error case, so that it matches the documented and
  intended return value \{error, \{already_started, pid()\} when local
  registered names are used.

  Own Id: OTP-18627 Aux Id: PR-7072

- `sys:get_state/1,2` and `sys:replace_state/2,3` has been corrected to handle a
  state named `error` as a state name, not as a failed system callback.

  For the standard server behaviours this was an issue only for `gen_statem`
  (and `gen_fsm`) when the state name was `error`, and for `gen_server` if the
  complete state was `{error,_}`.

  Own Id: OTP-18633

- Multiple problems were fixed in `filelib:safe_relative_path/2`. If its second
  argument was a path that contained symbolic links, an incorrect result patch
  could be returned. Also, paths were sometimes falsely considered unsafe.

  Own Id: OTP-18655 Aux Id: GH-6460, PR-7208

- Fix deadlock when `erl.exe` is used as part of a pipe on Windows and trying to
  set the encoding of the `standard_io` device.

  Own Id: OTP-18675 Aux Id: PR-7473 GH-7459

- Expanded the documentation about how to use the `standard_io`,
  `standard_error` and `user` I/O devices.

  Added the types [`io:standard_io/0`](`t:io:standard_io/0`),
  `io:standard:error/0` and [`io:user/0`](`t:io:user/0`).

  Own Id: OTP-18676 Aux Id: PR-7473 GH-7459

- Fix `h/2,3` to properly render multi-clause documentation.

  Own Id: OTP-18683 Aux Id: PR-7502

- Timers created by `timer:apply_after/4`, `apply_interval/4`, and
  `apply_repeatedly/4` would silently fail to do the apply if it was not
  possible to spawn a process when the timer expired. This has now been
  corrected, and if the spawn fails, the system will be taken down producing a
  crash dump.

  Own Id: OTP-18759 Aux Id: GH-7606

- When an Erlang source file lacked a module definition, there would be a
  spurious "module name must not be empty" diagnostic for each spec in the file.

### Improvements and New Features

- The argument descriptions for option types in `argparse` have been made less
  ambiguous.

  Own Id: OTP-18679 Aux Id: ERIERL-965

- Clarified the documentation of normal shutdown reason on `gen_server:call/2,3`

  Own Id: OTP-18690 Aux Id: PR-7511, GH-7510

- Pattern matching and equivalence (`=:=`, `=/=`) comparisons on `0.0` will now
  raise a warning, as it will no longer be considered equivalent to `-0.0` in
  OTP 27.

  If a match on `0.0` specifically is desired (distinct from `-0.0`), the
  warning can be suppressed by writing `+0.0` instead.

  The arithmetic comparison operators are unaffected, including arithmetic
  equality (`==`).

  - erlang:list_to_integer/2
  - string:to_integer/1

- The POSIX error `exdev` was sometimes incorrectly described as "cross domain
  link" in some error messages.

  Own Id: OTP-18578 Aux Id: GH-7213

## STDLIB 5.0

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- All process calls in `dets` have been updated to use the receive queue
  optimizations.

  Own Id: OTP-18275 Aux Id: PR-6045

- `proc_lib:start*/*` has become synchronous when the started process fails.
  This requires that a failing process use a new function
  `proc_lib:init_fail/2,3`, or exits, to indicate failure. All OTP behaviours
  have been fixed to do this.

  All these start functions now consume the `'EXIT'` message from a process link
  for all error returns. Previously it was only the `start_link/*` functions
  that did this, and only when the started function exited, not when it used
  `init_ack/1,2` or `init_fail/2,3` to create the return value.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-18471 Aux Id: GH-6339, PR-6843

- Fixed a bug where `file:read(standard_io, ...)` unexpectedly returned `eof` in
  binary mode.

- In the shell, `v(N)` would fail to retrieve the command if the command's
  return value was `undefined`.

  Own Id: OTP-18548 Aux Id: PR-6967

### Improvements and New Features

- The Erlang shell has been improved to support the following features:

  - Auto-complete variables, record names, record field names, map keys,
    function parameter types and filenames.
  - Open external editor in the shell (with C-o) to edit the current expression
    in an editor.
  - Support defining records (with types), functions and function typespecs, and
    custom types in the shell.
  - Do not save pager commands, and input to io:getline in history.

  Own Id: OTP-14835 Aux Id: PR-5924

- Gen_server now caches external functions for use in handle_call, handle_cast
  and handle_info.

  Own Id: OTP-15597 Aux Id: PR-5831

- The TTY/terminal subsystem has been rewritten by moving more code to Erlang
  from the old linked-in driver and implementing all the I/O primitives needed
  in a NIF instead.

  On Unix platforms the user should not notice a lot of difference, besides
  better handling of unicode characters and fixing of some long standing bugs.

  Windows users will notice that erl.exe has the same functionality as a normal
  Unix shell and that werl.exe has been removed and replaced with a symlink to
  erl.exe. This makes the Windows Erlang terminal experience identical to that
  of Unix.

  The re-write brings with it a number of bug fixes and feature additions:

  - The TTY is now reset when Erlang exits, fixing zsh to not break when
    terminating an Erlang session.
  - `standard_error` now uses the same unicode mode as `standard_io`.
  - Hitting backspace when searching the shell history with an empty search
    string no longer breaks the shell.
  - Tab expansion now works on remote nodes started using the JCL interface.
  - It is now possible to configure the shell slogan and the session slogans
    (that is the texts that appear when you start an Erlang shell). See the
    kernel documentation for more details.
  - Added shell:start_interactive for starting the interactive shell from a
    non-interactive Erlang session (for example an escript).
  - On Windows, when starting in detached mode the standard handler are now set
    to `nul` devices instead of being unset.
  - Standard I/O now always defaults to `unicode` mode if supported. Previously
    the default was `latin1` if the runtime system had been started with
    `-oldshell` or `-noshell` (for example in an `escript`). To send raw bytes
    over standard out, one now explicitly has to specify
    `io:setopts(standard_io, [{encoding, latin1}]).`

- Added the `zip:zip_get_crc32/2` function to retrieve the CRC32 checksum from
  an opened ZIP archive.

- The `re:replace/3,4` functions now accept a fun as the replacement argument.

  Own Id: OTP-18221 Aux Id: PR-6197

- The performance of the `base64` module has been significantly improved. For
  example, on an x86_64 system with the JIT both encode and decode are more than
  three times faster than in Erlang/OTP 25.

  Own Id: OTP-18228 Aux Id: GH-5639

- Improved implementation of `timer:apply_interval/4` reducing load on the timer
  server, and introduction of the new function `timer:apply_repeatedly/4`.
  `timer:apply_repeatedly/4` is similar to `timer:apply_interval/4`, but
  `timer:apply_repeatedly/4` prevents parallel execution of triggered `apply`
  operations which `timer:apply_interval/4` does not.

  Own Id: OTP-18236 Aux Id: PR-6256

- The `base64` module now supports encoding and decoding with an alternate URL
  safe alphabet, and an option for accepting or adding missing `=` padding
  characters.

  Own Id: OTP-18247 Aux Id: PR-6280, PR-6711

- Add `shell:whereis/0` which can be used to locate the current shell process.

  Own Id: OTP-18272 Aux Id: PR-6279

- The Erlang shell's auto-completion when typing `tab` has been changed to
  happen after the editing current line instead of before it.

  This behaviour can be configured using a the `shell_expand_location` STDLIB
  configuration parameter.

  Own Id: OTP-18278 Aux Id: PR-6260

- New function `ets:lookup_element/4` with a `Default` argument returned if the
  key did not exist in the table. The old `ets:lookup_element/3` raises a
  `badarg` exception which can be both inconvenient and slower.

  Own Id: OTP-18279 Aux Id: PR-6234

- Typing `Ctrl+L` in a shell now clears the screen and redraws the current line
  instead of only redrawing the current line. To only redraw the current line,
  you must now type `Alt+L`. This brings the behaviour of `Ctrl+L` closer to how
  bash and other shells work.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

- `peer` nodes using `standard_io` connections now include standard error from
  the node in the io stream from the started node.

  match binary patterns in parallel. Example: `<<A:8>> = <<B:4,C:4>> = Bin`

- Improve type specification of `unicode:characters_to_list()`.

  Own Id: OTP-18301 Aux Id: PR-6350

- In the `lists` module, the `zip` family of functions now takes options to
  allow handling lists of different lengths.

  Own Id: OTP-18318 Aux Id: PR-6347

- It is documented that `$\^X` is the ASCII code for Control X, where X is an
  uppercase or lowercase letter. However, this notation would work for any
  character X, even then it didn't make sense.

  In Erlang/OTP 26, it is now documented that the following characters are also
  allowed to follow the `\^` characters: `@`, `[`, `\`, `]`, `^`, `_`, and `?`.
  Attempt to use other characters will be rejected with a compiler error.

  The value for `$\^?` is now 127 (instead of 31 as in earlier releases).

  Own Id: OTP-18337 Aux Id: GH-6477, PR-6503

- The `binary:encode_hex/2` function has been added to allow the encoded
  hexadecimal digits to be in either lower or upper case.

- Optimized `gen_server:multi_call()`.

  Own Id: OTP-18385 Aux Id: PR-6698

- Map comprehensions as suggested in EEP 58 has now been implemented.

  Own Id: OTP-18413 Aux Id: EEP-58, PR-6727

- Some map operations have been optimized by changing the internal sort order of
  atom keys. This changes the (undocumented) order of how atom keys in small
  maps are printed and returned by `maps:to_list/1` and `maps:next/1`. The new
  order is unpredictable and may change between different invocations of the
  Erlang VM.

  For applications where order is important, there is a new function
  `maps:iterator/2` for creating iterators that return the map elements in a
  deterministic order. There are also new modifiers `k` and `K` for the format
  string for [`io:format()`](`t:io:format/0`) to support printing map elements
  ordered.

  Own Id: OTP-18414 Aux Id: PR-6151

- Make gen_server fail "silently" with a new return value for init/1.

  Own Id: OTP-18423 Aux Id: https://github.com/erlang/backlog/issues/142

- Improved the selective receive optimization, which can now be enabled for
  references returned from other functions.

  This greatly improves the performance of `gen_server:send_request/3`,
  `gen_server:wait_response/2`, and similar functions.

  Own Id: OTP-18431 Aux Id: PR-6739

- It is no longer necessary to enable a feature in the runtime system in order
  to load modules that are using it. It is sufficient to enable the feature in
  the compiler when compiling it.

  That means that to use feature `maybe_expr` in Erlang/OTP 26, it is sufficient
  to enable it during compilation.

  In Erlang/OTP 27, feature `maybe_expr` will be enabled by default, but it will
  be possible to disable it.

  support for gradual type checkers.

  Own Id: OTP-18522

- The by `gen_statem` previously used call proxy process that was used for
  preventing late replies from reaching the client at timeout or connection loss
  has been removed. It is no longer needed since _process aliases_ take care of
  this, are used, and supported by all Erlang nodes that an OTP 26 Erlang node
  can communicate with.

  Own Id: OTP-18537 Aux Id: PR-7081

- Added the `argparse` module for simplified argument handling in escripts and
  similar.

  - insert newline in middle of line (alt+enter)
  - navigate top (alt+<)/(alt+shift+up)
  - navigate bottom (alt+>)/(alt+shift+down)
  - clear current expression (alt+c)
  - cancel search (alt+c)
  - opening editor on mac (option+o)/(alt+o)

  Modifies the prompt for new lines to make it clearer that the prompt has
  entered multi-line mode. Supports terminal with small window size, recommend
  not go lower than 7 rows and 40 columns. Modifies the search prompt to support
  multi-line statements. Redraw the prompt after continuing from JCL menu.

### Improvements and New Features

- There is a new configure option, `--enable-deterministic-build`, which will
  apply the `deterministic` compiler option when building Erlang/OTP. The
  `deterministic` option has been improved to eliminate more sources of
  non-determinism in several applications.

## STDLIB 4.0.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- In the initial release of Erlang/OTP 25, the expression bound to the `_`
  pseudo-field in a record initialization would always be evaluated once, even
  if all other fields in the record were explicitly initialized. That would
  break the use case of binding the expression `error(...)` to `_` in order to
  get an exception if not all fields were initialized.

  The behavior of binding to `_` has been reverted to the pre-OTP 25 behavior,
  that is, to not evaluate the expression if all fields have been bound to
  explicit values.

  A similar fix was also done when using io:format/2 and the current
  group_leader was set to the current process.

- If a default record field initialization (`_ = Expr`) was used even though all
  records fields were explicitly initialized, `Expr` would not be evaluated.
  That would not be a problem, except when `Expr` would bind a variable
  subsequently used, in which case the compiler would crash.

  As an example, if record `#r{}` is defined to have only one field `a`, the
  following code would crash the compiler:

  `#r{a=[],_=V=42}, V`

  To fix that problem, the compiler will make sure that `Expr` is always
  evaluated at least once. The compiler will now rewrite the example to
  essentially:

  `V=42, #r{a=[]}, V`

  Own Id: OTP-18083

### Improvements and New Features

- Users can now configure ETS tables with the `{write_concurrency, auto}`
  option. This option forces tables to automatically change the number of locks
  that are used at run-time depending on how much concurrency is detected. The
  `{decentralized_counters, true}` option is enabled by default when
  `{write_concurrency, auto}` is active.

  Benchmark results comparing this option with the other ETS optimization
  options are available here:

- The `format_status/2` callback for `gen_server`, `gen_statem` and `gen_event`
  has been deprecated in favor of the new `format_status/1` callback.

  The new callback adds the possibility to limit and change many more things
  than the just the state, such as the last received message, the reason for
  terminating and more events specific to each type of behavior. See the
  respective modules documentation for more details.

- The tagged tuple tests and fun-calls have been optimized and are now a little
  bit cheaper than previously.

  These optimizations become possible after making sure that all boxed terms
  have at least one word allocated after the arity word. This has been
  accomplished by letting all empty tuples refer to the same empty tuple literal
  which also reduces memory usage for empty tuples.

- The signal queue benchmark in parallel_messages_SUITE and the ETS benchmark in
  ets_SUITE have benchmark result visualization HTML pages with "fill-screen"
  buttons to make the graphs bigger. This button did not work as intended

  a bigger version and not the one over the button. This is now fixed.

- The non-local function handler for the `erl_eval` can now be called with

  All errors during evaluation will now be passed through `erlang:raise/3`. If
  the restricted shell is active and it does not let `erlang:raise/3` through,
  evaluation errors will be printed in less clear way. See the documentation for
  restricted shell in `shell`.

- A new PRNG have been added to the `rand` module: `mwc59` which has been
  developed in collaboration with Sebastiano Vigna. It is intended for
  applications that need really fast pseudo-random numbers, and it comes with
  two output value scramblers, one fast and one thorough.

  Two internal functions for the `exsp` generator have also been exported so
  they can be used outside the `rand` plug-in framework to shave off some
  overhead.

  The internal `splitmix64` generator has also been exported which can be useful
  for seeding other kinds of PRNG:s than its own.

- The [_process alias_](`e:system:ref_man_processes.md#process-aliases`) feature
  as outlined by
  [EEP 53](https://github.com/erlang/eep/blob/master/eeps/eep-0053.md) has been
  introduced. It is introduced in order to provide a lightweight mechanism that
  can prevent late replies after timeout or connection loss. For more
  information, see EEP 53 and the documentation of the new
  [`alias/1`](`erlang:alias/1`) BIF and the new options to the
  [`monitor/3`](`erlang:monitor/3`) BIF.

  The `call` operation in the framework used by `gen_server`, `gen_statem`, and
  `gen_event` has been updated to utilize alias in order to prevent late
  responses. The `gen_statem` behavior still use a proxy process in the
  distributed case, since it has always prevented late replies and aliases wont
  work against pre OTP 24 nodes. The proxy process can be removed in OTP 26.

  The alias feature also made it possible to introduce new functions similar to
  the [`erpc:receive_response()`](`erpc:receive_response/2`) function in the gen
  behaviors, so the new functions
  [`gen_server:receive_response()`](`gen_server:receive_response/2`),
  [`gen_statem:receive_response()`](`gen_statem:receive_response/2`),
  [`gen_event:receive_response()`](`gen_event:receive_response/2`) have also

  `maps:foreach/2`.

  `maps:merge_with/3` is the same as `merge/2` but takes an extra fun that is
  used to combine items with the same key.

  `maps:intersect/2` computes the intersection of two maps.

  `maps:intersect_with/3` is the same as `intersect/2` but takes an extra fun
  that is used to combine intersecting items.

  `maps:filtermap/2` allows filtering and mapping of a map in a single pass.

  `maps:from_keys/2` constructs a map from a list of keys and a single value and

- The pretty printer for floating point number have been changed to make it
  easier to see if the integer part of the number has been rounded. After the
  change the digit that may have been rounded always appears last or just before
  the exponent character (e or E). This is accomplished by always printing the
  number using scientific notation if it is so large that the integer part could
  be rounded.

  Added a new chapter to the Users Guide about Uniform Resource Identifiers and
  their handling with the new API.

  Added two new API functions: uri_string:allowed_characters/0 and
  uri_string:percent_decode/1.

  This change has been marked as potentially incompatible as
  uri*string:normalize/2 used to decode percent-encoded character triplets that
  corresponded to characters not in the reserved set. After this change,
  uri_string:normalize/2 will only decode those percent-encoded triplets that
  correspond to characters in the unreserved set (ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." /
  "*" / "~").

  behaviours in STDLIB and Kernel. This includes `proc_lib`, `gen_server`,
  `gen_event`, `gen_statem`, `gen_fsm`, `supervisor`, `supervisor_bridge` and
  `application`.

  Improved the [`chars_limit`](`m:logger_formatter#chars_limit`) and
  [`depth`](`m:logger_formatter#depth`) handling in `proc_lib` and when
  formatting of exceptions.

  Own Id: OTP-15299

- Improved ETS scalability of concurrent calls that change the size of a table,
  like `ets:insert/2` and `ets:delete/2`.

  This performance feature was implemented for `ordered_set` in OTP 22.0 and
  does now apply for all ETS table types.

  The improved scalability may come at the cost of longer latency of
  `ets:info(T,size)` and `ets:info(T,memory)`. A new table option
  `decentralized_counters` has therefore been added. It is default `true` for
  `ordered_set` with `write_concurrency` enabled and default `false` for all
  other table types.

- The bug with ID ERL-717 has been fixed. The functions `io:columns()` and
  `io:rows()` only worked correctly inside interactive erlang shells before this

  and stdin were connected to a terminal when they were invoked from an escript
  or a program started with e.g., `erl -noshell`.

  Own Id: OTP-15959 Aux Id: ERL-717

- Fixed handling of ".." and "@" in wildcards. ".." would only work when
  preceded by a literal pattern such as in "a/..", not when preceded by wildcard
  characters such as in "\*/..". The combination "@/.." was also broken, and in
  addition "@" in a pattern could degrade performance of the wildcard matching.

  Own Id: OTP-15987 Aux Id: ERL-1029

- Make sure `ets:fun2ms()` can handle `++/2` in the head of functions when
  called from the shell.

  Own Id: OTP-15992 Aux Id: PR-2322

### Improvements and New Features

- Debugging of time-outs in `gen_statem` has been improved. Starting a time-out
  is now logged in `sys:log` and `sys:trace`. Running time-outs are visible in
  server crash logs, and with `sys:get_status`. Due to this system events
  `{start_timer, Action, State}` and `{insert_timout, Event, State}` have been
  added, which may surprise tools that rely on the format of these events.

  New features: The `EventContent` of a running time-out can be updated with
  `{TimeoutType, update, NewEventContent}`. Running time-outs can be cancelled
  with `{TimeoutType, cancel}` which is more readable than using
  `Time = infinity`.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

- ETS `ordered_set` tables with `write_concurrency` enabled has got a

  Own Id: OTP-15649

- A bug has been fixed in the `maps` implementation that could cause a crash or
  memory usage to grow until the machine ran out of memory. This could happen
  when inserting a new key-value pair with a key `K1` containing a binary `B1`
  into a map `M` having a key `K2` with a binary `B2` if the following
  conditions were met:

  - `B1 =/= B2`
  - `size(B1) >= 4294967296`
  - `size(B2) >= 4294967296`
  - `size(M) >= 32`
  - `(size(B1) rem 4294967296) == (size(B2) rem 4294967296)`
  - the first `(size(B1) rem 4294967296)` bytes are the same both in `B1` and
    `B2`
  - substituting `B1` in `K1` with `B2` would create a term with the same value
    as `K2`

  The root cause of the problem is that the `maps` implementation only hashed
  the first `(X rem 4294967296)` bytes of binaries so that different binaries
  could get the same hash value independently of the hash seed.

  Own Id: OTP-15707

- Since the introduction of the stack trace variable, the Erlang Pretty Printer
  has left out the exception class `throw` even when the stack trace variable
  cannot be left out, which is not correct Erlang code. The fix is to always
  include the exception class `throw`.

  Own Id: OTP-15751

- `record_info/2` is a pseudo-function that requires literal arguments known at
  compile time. Therefore, the following usage is illegal: `fun record/info/2`.
  The compiler would crash when during compilation of that kind of code.
  Corrected to issue a compilation error.

  Own Id: OTP-15760 Aux Id: ERL-907

### Improvements and New Features

- A new `rand` module algorithm, `exro928ss` (Xoroshiro928\*\*), has been
  implemented. It has got a really long period and good statistical quality for
  all output bits, while still being only about 50% slower than the default
  algorithm.

  The same generator is also used as a long period counter in a new `crypto`
  plugin for the `rand` module, algorithm `crypto_aes`. This plugin uses AES-256
  to scramble the counter which buries any detectable statistical artifacts.
  Scrambling is done in chunks which are cached to get good amortized speed

- Previously, all ETS tables used centralized counter variables to keep track of
  the number of items stored and the amount of memory consumed. These counters
  can cause scalability problems (especially on big NUMA systems). This change
  adds an implementation of a decentralized counter and modifies the
  implementation of ETS so that ETS tables of type `ordered_set` with
  `write_concurrency` enabled use the decentralized counter. Experiments
  indicate that this change substantially improves the scalability of ETS
  `ordered_set` tables with `write_concurrency` enabled in scenarios with

- File operations used to accept [filenames](`t:file:name_all/0`) containing
  null characters (integer value zero). This caused the name to be truncated and
  in some cases arguments to primitive operations to be mixed up. Filenames
  containing null characters inside the filename are now _rejected_ and will
  cause primitive file operations to fail.

  Also environment variable operations used to accept
  [names](`t:os:env_var_name/0`) and [values](`t:os:env_var_value/0`) of
  environment variables containing null characters (integer value zero). This
  caused operations to silently produce erroneous results. Environment variable
  names and values containing null characters inside the name or value are now
  _rejected_ and will cause environment variable operations to fail.

  Primitive environment variable operations also used to accept the `$=`
  character in environment variable names causing various problems. `$=`
  characters in environment variable names are now also _rejected_.

  Also `os:cmd/1` now reject null characters inside its
  [command](`t:os:os_command/0`).

  `erlang:open_port/2` will also reject null characters inside the port name
  from now on.

- The semantics of timeout parameter `{clean_timeout,infinity}` to

- A new logging API is added to Erlang/OTP, see the `m:logger` manual page, and
  section [Logging](`e:kernel:logger_chapter.md`) in the Kernel User's Guide.

  Calls to `error_logger` are automatically redirected to the new API, and
  legacy error logger event handlers can still be used. It is, however,
  recommended to use the Logger API directly when writing new code.

  Notice the following potential incompatibilities:

  - Kernel configuration parameters `error_logger` still works, but is overruled
    if the default handler's output destination is configured with Kernel
    configuration parameter `logger`.

    In general, parameters for configuring error logger are overwritten by new
    parameters for configuring Logger.

  - The concept of SASL error logging is deprecated, meaning that by default the
    SASL application does not affect which log events are logged.

    By default, supervisor reports and crash reports are logged by the default
    Logger handler started by Kernel, and end up at the same destination
    (terminal or file) as other standard log event from Erlang/OTP.

    Progress reports are not logged by default, but can be enabled by setting
    the primary log level to info, for example with the Kernel configuration
    parameter `logger_level`.

    To obtain backwards compatibility with the SASL error logging functionality
    from earlier releases, set Kernel configuration parameter
    `logger_sasl_compatible` to `true`. This prevents the default Logger handler
    from logging any supervisor-, crash-, or progress reports. Instead, SASL
    adds a separate Logger handler during application start, which takes care of
    these log events. The SASL configuration parameters `sasl_error_logger` and
    `sasl_errlog_type` specify the destination (terminal or file) and severity
    level to log for these events.

  Since Logger is new in Erlang/OTP 21.0, we do reserve the right to introduce
  changes to the Logger API and functionality in patches following this release.
  These changes might or might not be backwards compatible with the initial
  version.

- Functions `rand:uniform_real/0` and `rand:uniform_real_s/1` have been added.
  They produce uniformly distributed numbers in the range `0.0 =< X < 1.0` that
  are as close to random real numbers as Normalized IEEE 754 Double Precision
  allows. Because the random real number exactly `0.0` is infinitely improbable
  they will never return exactly `0.0`.

  These properties are useful when you need to call for example `math:log(X)` or
  `1 / X` on a random value `X`, since that will never fail with a number from
  these new functions.

- The new functions `io_lib:fwrite/3` and `io_lib:format/3` take a third
  argument, an option list. The only option is `chars_limit`, which is used for
  limiting the number of returned characters. The limit is soft, which means
  that the number of returned characters exceeds the limit with at most a
  smallish amount. If the limit is set, the functions `format/3` and `fwrite/3`
  try to distribute the number of characters evenly over the control sequences
  `pPswW`. Furthermore, the control sequences `pPwP` try to distribute the
  number of characters evenly over substructures.

  A modification of the control sequences `pPwW` is that even if there is no
  limit on the number of returned characters, all associations of a map are
  printed to the same depth. The aim is to give a more consistent output as the
  order of map keys is not defined. As before, if the depth is less than the
  number of associations of a map, the selection of associations to print is
  arbitrary.

### Improvements and New Features

- Improved unicode support for strings. Added normalization functions in the
  `unicode` module. Extended the `string` module API with new functions with
  improved unicode handling and that works on grapheme clusters. The new
  functions operates on the [`unicode:chardata()`](`t:unicode:chardata/0`) type,
  thus they also accept `UTF-8 binaries` as input.

  The old string API have been marked as obsolete. The return values have been
  changed for some error cases.

- `sets:add_element/2` is faster when adding an element that is already present,

  with many overlapping elements, up to two orders of magnitude faster.

- The shell functions `c/1` and `c/2` have been extended so that if the argument
  is a module name instead of a file name, it automatically locates the .beam
  file and the corresponding source file, and then recompiles the module using
  the same compiler options (plus any options passed to c/2). If compilation
  fails, the old beam file is preserved. Also adds `c(Mod, Opts, Filter)`, where
  the Filter argument allows you to remove old compiler options before the new

- `erl_tar` in previous versions of OTP only supports the USTAR format. That
  limited path names to at most 255 bytes, and did not support Unicode
  characters in names in a portable way.

  `erl_tar` now has support for reading tar archives in the formats currently in
  common use, such as v7, STAR, USTAR, PAX, and GNU tar's extensions to the
  STAR/USTAR format. When writing tar archives, `erl_tar` can now write them in
  the `PAX` format if necessary (for example, to support very long filenames or
  filenames with Unicode characters). If possible, `erl_tar` will still write
  tar archives in the USTAR for maximum portability.

- Upgraded the OTP internal PCRE library from version 8.33 to version 8.40. This
  library is used for implementation of the `m:re` regular expressions module.

  Besides various bug fixes, the new version allows for better stack protection.
  In order to utilize this feature, the stack size of normal scheduler threads
  is now by default set to 128 kilo words on all platforms. The stack size of
  normal scheduler threads can be set upon system start by passing the
  [`+sss`](`e:erts:erl_cmd.md#sched_thread_stack_size`) command line argument to
  the [`erl`](`e:erts:erl_cmd.md`) command.

  states crash.

  The crash report generated by `proc_lib` includes the new tag
  `message_queue_len`. The neighbour report also includes the new tag
  `current_stacktrace`. Finally, the neighbour report no longer includes the
  tags `messages` and `dictionary`.

  The new function `error_logger:get_format_depth/0` can be used to retrieve the

### Improvements and New Features

- Bug fixes, new features and improvements to gen_statem:

  A new type init_result/1 has replaced the old init_result/0, so if you used
  that old type (that was never documented) you have to change your code, which
  may be regarded as a potential incompatibility.

  Changing callback modes after code change did not work since the new callback
  mode was not recorded. This bug has been fixed.

  The event types state_timeout and \{call,From\} could not be generated with a
  \{next_event,EventType,EventContent\} action since they did not pass the
  runtime type check. This bug has now been corrected.

  State entry calls can now be repeated using (new) state callback returns
  \{repeat*state,...\}, \{repeat_state_and_data,*\} and repeat_state_and_data.

  There have been lots of code cleanup in particular regarding timer handling.
  For example is async cancel_timer now used. Error handling has also been
  cleaned up.

  To align with probable future changes to the rest of gen\_\*, terminate/3 has
  now got a fallback and code_change/4 is not mandatory.

  Own Id: OTP-12502 Aux Id: OTP-12501

- Background: In record fields with a type declaration but without an
  initializer, the Erlang parser inserted automatically the singleton type
  `'undefined'` to the list of declared types, if that value was not present
  there. That is, the record declaration:

  \-record(rec, \{f1 :: float(), f2 = 42 :: integer(), f3 ::
  some_mod:some_typ()\}).

  was translated by the parser to:

  \-record(rec, \{f1 :: float() | 'undefined', f2 = 42 :: integer(), f3 ::
  some_mod:some_typ() | 'undefined'\}).

  The rationale for this was that creation of a "dummy" `#rec{}` record should
  not result in a warning from dialyzer that, for example, the implicit
  initialization of the `#rec.f1` field violates its type declaration.

  Problems: This seemingly innocent action has some unforeseen consequences.

  For starters, there is no way for programmers to declare that e.g. only floats
  make sense for the `f1` field of `#rec{}` records when there is no "obvious"
  default initializer for this field. (This also affects tools like PropEr that
  use these declarations produced by the Erlang parser to generate random
  instances of records for testing purposes.)

  It also means that dialyzer does not warn if e.g. an
  [`is_atom/1`](`is_atom/1`) test or something more exotic like an
  [`atom_to_list/1`](`atom_to_list/1`) call is performed on the value of the
  `f1` field.

  Similarly, there is no way to extend dialyzer to warn if it finds record
  constructions where `f1` is not initialized to some float.

  Last but not least, it is semantically problematic when the type of the field
  is an opaque type: creating a union of an opaque and a structured type is very
  problematic for analysis because it fundamentally breaks the opacity of the
  term at that point.

  Change: To solve these problems the parser will not automatically insert the
  `'undefined'` value anymore; instead the user has the option to choose the
  places where this value makes sense (for the field) and where it does not and
  insert the `| 'undefined'` there manually.

  Consequences of this change: This change means that dialyzer will issue a
  warning for all places where records with uninitialized fields are created and
  those fields have a declared type that is incompatible with `'undefined'`
  (e.g. `t:float/0`). This warning can be suppressed easily by adding
  `| 'undefined'` to the type of this field. This also adds documentation that
  the user really intends to create records where this field is uninitialized.

- A new behaviour `gen_statem` has been implemented. It has been thoroughly
  reviewed, is stable enough to be used by at least two heavy OTP applications,
  and is here to stay. But depending on user feedback, we do not expect but
  might find it necessary to make minor not backwards compatible changes into
  OTP-20.0, so its state can be designated as "not quite experimental"...

  The `gen_statem` behaviour is intended to replace `gen_fsm` for new code. It
  has the same features and add some really useful:

  - State code is gathered
  - The state can be any term
  - Events can be postponed
  - Events can be self generated
  - A reply can be sent from a later state
  - There can be multiple sys traceable replies

  The callback model(s) for `gen_statem` differs from the one for `gen_fsm`, but
  it is still fairly easy to rewrite from `gen_fsm` to `gen_statem`.

- Optimize binary:split/2 and binary:split/3 with native BIF implementation.

  Own Id: OTP-13082

- Background: The types of record fields have since R12B been put in a separate
  form by `epp:parse_file()`, leaving the record declaration form untyped. The
  separate form, however, does not follow the syntax of type declarations, and
  parse transforms inspecting `-type()` attributes need to know about the
  special syntax. Since the compiler stores the return value of
  `epp:parse_file()` as debug information in the abstract code chunk (`"Abst"`
  or `abstract_code`), tools too need to know about the special syntax, if they
  inspect `-type()` attributes in abstract code.

  Change: No separate type form is created by `epp:parse_file()`, but the type
  information is kept in the record fields. This means that all parse transforms
  and all tools inspecting `-record()` declarations need to recognize
  `{typed_record_field, Field, Type}`.

  Own Id: OTP-12990

### Improvements and New Features

- A mechanism for limiting the amount of text that the built-in error logger
  events will produce has been introduced. It is useful for limiting both the
  size of log files and the CPU time used to produce them.

  This mechanism is experimental in the sense that it may be changed if it turns
  out that it does not solve the problem it is supposed to solve. In that case,
  there may be backward incompatible improvements to this mechanism.

  See the documentation for the config parameter `error_logger_format_depth` in
  the Kernel application for information about how to turn on this feature.

## STDLIB 2.5

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fix handling of single dot in filename:join/2

  The reference manual says that filename:join(A,B) is equivalent to
  filename:join(\[A,B]). In some rare cases this turns out not to be true. For
  example:

  `filename:join("/a/.","b") -> "/a/./b"` vs
  `filename:join(["/a/.","b"]) -> "/a/b"`.

  This has been corrected. A single dot is now only kept if it occurs at the
  very beginning or the very end of the resulting path.

- Cache nowarn_bif_clash functions in erl_lint.

  This patch stores nowarn_bif_clash in the lint record. By using erlc

  Own Id: OTP-12814

- There are many cases where user code needs to be able to distinguish between a
  socket that was closed normally and one that was aborted. Setting the option
  \{show_econnreset, true\} enables the user to receive ECONNRESET errors on
  both active and passive sockets.

  Own Id: OTP-12841

### Improvements and New Features

- Allow maps for supervisor flags and child specs

  Earlier, supervisor flags and child specs were given as tuples. While this is
  kept for backwards compatibility, it is now also allowed to give these
  parameters as maps, see [sup_flags](`m:supervisor#sup_flags`) and
  [child_spec](`m:supervisor#child_spec`).

  Own Id: OTP-11043

- A new system message, `terminate`, is added. This can be sent with
  `sys:terminate/2,3`. If the receiving process handles system messages properly
  it will terminate shortly after receiving this message.

  The new function `proc_lib:stop/1,3` utilizes this new system message and
  monitors the receiving process in order to facilitate a synchronous stop
  mechanism for 'special processes'.

  `proc_lib:stop/1,3` is used by the following functions:

  - `gen_server:stop/1,3` (new)
  - `gen_fsm:stop/1,3` (new)
  - `gen_event:stop/1,3` (modified to be synchronous)
  - `wx_object:stop/1,3` (new)

- Add three new functions to `io_lib`\-- `scan_format/2`, `unscan_format/1`, and
  `build_text/1`\-- which expose the parsed form of the format control sequences
  to make it possible to easily modify or filter the input to `io_lib:format/2`.
  This can e.g. be used in order to replace unbounded-size control sequences
  like `~w` or `~p` with corresponding depth-limited `~W` and `~P` before doing
  the actual formatting.

  Own Id: OTP-12167

- Introduce the `erl_anno` module, an abstraction of the second element of
  tokens and tuples in the abstract format.

  only contains one separator character.

  Own Id: OTP-12422 Aux Id: seq12774

- The documentation of the Abstract Format (in the ERTS User's Guide) has been
  updated with types and specification. (Thanks to Anthony Ramine.)

  The explicit representation of parentheses used in types of the abstract
  format has been removed. Instead the new functions
  `erl_parse:type_inop_prec()` and `erl_parse:type_preop_prec()` can be used for
  inserting parentheses where needed.

  reverse of the original killed text.

  Own Id: OTP-12224

- If a callback function was terminated with exit/1, there would be no stack
  trace in the ERROR REPORT produced by gen_server. This has been corrected.

  To keep the backwards compatibility, the actual exit reason for the process is
  not changed.

  Own Id: OTP-12263 Aux Id: seq12733

- Warnings produced by `ms_transform` could point out the wrong line number.

  Own Id: OTP-12264

### Improvements and New Features

- Supports tar file creation on other media than file systems mounted on the
  local machine.

  The `erl_tar` api is extended with `erl_tar:init/3` that enables usage of user
  provided media storage routines. A ssh-specific set of such routines is hidden
  in the new function `ssh_sftp:open_tar/3` to simplify creating a tar archive
  on a remote ssh server.

  A chunked file reading option is added to `erl_tar:add/3,4` to save memory on
  e.g small embedded systems. The size of the slices read from a file in that
  case can be specified.

## STDLIB 2.1.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- OTP-11850 fixed filelib:wildcard/1 to work with broken symlinks. This
  correction, however, introduced problems since symlinks were no longer
  followed for functions like filelib:ensure_dir/1, filelib:is_dir/1,
  filelib:file_size/1, etc. This is now corrected.

  Own Id: OTP-12054 Aux Id: seq12660

- `erl_tar` can now handle files names that contain Unicode characters. See
  "UNICODE SUPPORT" in the documentation for `erl_tar`.

  When creating a tar file, `erl_tar` would sometime write a too short end of

- Fix evaluation of map updates in the debugger and erl_eval

  Reported-by: José Valim

  Own Id: OTP-11922

### Improvements and New Features

- The following native functions now bump an appropriate amount of reductions
  and yield when out of reductions:

  - `erlang:binary_to_list/1`
  - `erlang:binary_to_list/3`
  - `erlang:bitstring_to_list/1`
  - `erlang:list_to_binary/1`
  - `erlang:iolist_to_binary/1`
  - `erlang:list_to_bitstring/1`
  - `binary:list_to_bin/1`

  Characteristics impact:

  - **Performance** - The functions converting from lists got a performance loss
    for very small lists, and a performance gain for very large lists.

  - **Priority** - Previously a process executing one of these functions
    effectively got an unfair priority boost. This priority boost depended on
    the input size. The larger the input was, the larger the priority boost got.
    This unfair priority boost is now lost.

## STDLIB 2.0

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- The option dupnames did not work as intended in re. When looking for names
  with \{capture, \[Name, ...]\}, re:run returned a random instance of the match
  for that name, instead of the leftmost matching instance, which was what the
  documentation stated. This is now corrected to adhere to the documentation.
  The option \{capture,all_names\} along with a re:inspect/2 function is also
  added to further help in using named subpatterns.

  Own Id: OTP-11205

- If option 'binary' was set for standard_input, then c:i() would hang if the
  output was more than one page long - i.e. then input after "(c)ontinue (q)uit

  Own Id: OTP-11677

- Allow all auto imports to be suppressed at once. Introducing the
  no_auto_import attribute: -compile(no_auto_import). Useful for code generation
  tools that always use the qualified function names and want to avoid the auto
  imported functions clashing with local ones. (Thanks to José Valim.)

  Own Id: OTP-11682

- supervisor_bridge does no longer report normal termination of children. The
  reason is that in some cases, for instance when the restart strategy is
  simple_one_for_one, the log could be completely overloaded with reports about
  normally terminating processes. (Thanks to Artem Ocheredko)

  Own Id: OTP-11685

- The type annotations for alternative registries using the \{via, Module,
  Name\} syntax for sup_name() and sup_ref() in the supervisor module are now

  valid supervisor:start_link() and supervisor:start_child() calls. (Thanks to
  Caleb Helbling.)

  Own Id: OTP-11707

- Two Dets bugs have been fixed. When trying to open a short file that is not a
  Dets file, the file was deleted even with just read access. Calling

  Own Id: OTP-11772

- The functions `sys:get_state/1,2` and `sys:replace_state/2,3` are fixed so
  they can now be run while the process is sys suspended. To accomplish this,
  the new callbacks `Mod:system_get_state/1` and `Mod:system_replace_state/2`
  are added, which are also implemented by the generic behaviours `gen_server`,
  `gen_event` and `gen_fsm`.

  The potential incompatibility refers to:

  - The previous behaviour of intercepting the system message and passing a
    tuple of size 2 as the last argument to `sys:handle_system_msg/6` is no
    longer supported.
  - The error handling when `StateFun` in `sys:replace_state/2,3` fails is
    changed from being totally silent to possibly (if the callback module does
    not catch) throw an exception in the client process.

  (Thanks to James Fish and Steve Vinoski)

- The pre-defined types `array/0`, `dict/0`, `digraph/0`, `gb_set/0`,
  `gb_tree/0`, `queue/0`, `set/0`, and `tid/0` have been deprecated. They will
  be removed in Erlang/OTP 18.0.

  Instead the types [`array:array/0`](`t:array:array/0`),
  [`dict:dict/0`](`t:dict:dict/0`), [`digraph:graph/0`](`t:digraph:graph/0`),
  `gb_set:set/0`, `gb_tree:tree/0`, [`queue:queue/0`](`t:queue:queue/0`),
  [`sets:set/0`](`t:sets:set/0`), and [`ets:tid/0`](`t:ets:tid/0`) can be used.
  (Note: it has always been necessary to use [`ets:tid/0`](`t:ets:tid/0`).)

  It is allowed in Erlang/OTP 17.0 to locally re-define the types `array/0`,
  `dict/0`, and so on.

  New types [`array:array/1`](`t:array:array/1`),
  [`dict:dict/2`](`t:dict:dict/2`), [`gb_sets:set/1`](`t:gb_sets:set/1`),
  [`gb_trees:tree/2`](`t:gb_trees:tree/2`),
  [`queue:queue/1`](`t:queue:queue/1`), and [`sets:set/1`](`t:sets:set/1`) have
  been added.

  A compiler option, `nowarn_deprecated_type`, has been introduced. By including
  the attribute

  `-compile(nowarn_deprecated_type).`

  in an Erlang source file, warnings about deprecated types can be avoided in
  Erlang/OTP 17.0.

  The option can also be given as a compiler flag:

  `erlc +nowarn_deprecated_type file.erl`

- The version of the PCRE library Used by Erlang's re module is raised to 8.33
  from 7.6. This means, among other things, better Unicode and Unicode Character
  Properties support. New options connected to PCRE 8.33 are also added to the
  re module (ucd, notempty_atstart, no_start_optimize). PCRE has extended the
  regular expression syntax between 7.6 and 8.33, why this imposes a potential
  incompatibility. Only very complicated regular expressions may be affected,
  but if you know you are using obscure features, please test run your regular
  expressions and verify that their behavior has not changed.

  Own Id: OTP-11204

- Added dict:is_empty/1 and orddict:is_empty/1. (Thanks to Magnus Henoch.)

  Own Id: OTP-11353

- A call to either the [`garbage_collect/1`](`garbage_collect/1`) BIF or the
  [`check_process_code/2`](`check_process_code/2`) BIF may trigger garbage
  collection of another processes than the process calling the BIF. The previous
  implementations performed these kinds of garbage collections without
  considering the internal state of the process being garbage collected. In
  order to be able to more easily and more efficiently implement yielding native
  code, these types of garbage collections have been rewritten. A garbage
  collection like this is now triggered by an asynchronous request signal, the
  actual garbage collection is performed by the process being garbage collected
  itself, and finalized by a reply signal to the process issuing the request.
  Using this approach processes can disable garbage collection and yield without
  having to set up the heap in a state that can be garbage collected.

  The [`garbage_collect/2`](`erlang:garbage_collect/2`), and
  [`check_process_code/3`](`erlang:check_process_code/3`) BIFs have been
  introduced. Both taking an option list as last argument. Using these, one can
  issue asynchronous requests.

  `code:purge/1` and `code:soft_purge/1` have been rewritten to utilize
  asynchronous `check_process_code` requests in order to parallelize work.

  Characteristics impact: A call to the
  [`garbage_collect/1`](`garbage_collect/1`) BIF or the
  [`check_process_code/2`](`check_process_code/2`) BIF will normally take longer
  time to complete while the system as a whole wont be as much negatively
  effected by the operation as before. A call to `code:purge/1` and
  `code:soft_purge/1` may complete faster or slower depending on the state of
  the system while the system as a whole wont be as much negatively effected by
  the operation as before.

  to several orders of magnitude faster than the old `from_list/1`.

- EEP43: New data type - Maps

  With Maps you may for instance:

  - \_\_\_\_ - `M0 = #{ a => 1, b => 2}, % create associations`

  - \_\_\_\_ - `M1 = M0#{ a := 10 }, % update values`

  - \_\_\_\_ - `M2 = M1#{ "hi" => "hello"}, % add new associations`

  - \_\_\_\_ - `#{ "hi" := V1, a := V2, b := V3} = M2. % match keys with values`

  For information on how to use Maps please see Map Expressions in the
  [Reference Manual](`e:system:expressions.md#map-expressions`).

  The current implementation is without the following features:

  - \_\_\_\_ - No variable keys

  - \_\_\_\_ - No single value access

  - \_\_\_\_ - No map comprehensions

  Note that Maps is _experimental_ during OTP 17.0.

- Integrate elliptic curve contribution from Andreas Schultz

  In order to be able to support elliptic curve cipher suites in SSL/TLS,
  additions to handle elliptic curve infrastructure has been added to public_key
  and crypto.

  This also has resulted in a rewrite of the crypto API to gain consistency and
  remove unnecessary overhead. All OTP applications using crypto has been
  updated to use the new API.

  Impact: Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) offers equivalent security with
  smaller key sizes than other public key algorithms. Smaller key sizes result
  in savings for power, memory, bandwidth, and computational cost that make ECC
  especially attractive for constrained environments.

  footprint for tables using write_concurrency. The memory consumption per
  inserted record is not affected. The increased footprint can be particularly

- Leave control back to gen_server during supervisor's restart loop

  When an attempt to restart a child failed, supervisor would earlier keep the
  execution flow and try to restart the child over and over again until it
  either succeeded or the restart frequency limit was reached. If none of these
  happened, supervisor would hang forever in this loop.

  This commit adds a timer of 0 ms where the control is left back to the
  gen_server which implements the supervisor. This way any incoming request to
  the supervisor will be handled - which could help breaking the infinite loop -
  e.g. shutdown request for the supervisor or for the problematic child.

  This introduces some incompatibilities in stdlib due to new return values from
  supervisor:

  - restart_child/2 can now return \{error,restarting\}
  - delete_child/2 can now return \{error,restarting\}
  - which_children/1 returns a list of \{Id,Child,Type,Mods\}, where Child, in
    addition to the old pid() or 'undefined', now also can be 'restarting'.

  Own Id: OTP-9953

- When an escript ends now all printout to standard output and standard error
  gets out on the terminal. This bug has been corrected by changing the
  behaviour of erlang:halt/0,1, which should fix the same problem for other
  escript-like applications, i.e that data stored in the output port driver
  buffers got lost when printing on a TTY and exiting through erlang:halt/0,1.

  The BIF:s erlang:halt/0,1 has gotten improved semantics and there is a new BIF
  erlang:halt/2 to accomplish something like the old semantics. See the
  documentation.

  Now erlang:halt/0 and erlang:halt/1 with an integer argument will close all
  ports and allow all pending async threads operations to finish before exiting
  the emulator. Previously erlang:halt/0 and erlang:halt(0) would just wait for
  pending async threads operations but not close ports. And erlang:halt/1 with a
  non-zero integer argument would not even wait for pending async threads
  operations.

  To roughly the old behaviour, to not wait for ports and async threads
  operations when you exit the emulator, you use erlang:halt/2 with an integer
  first argument and an option list containing \{flush,false\} as the second
  argument. Note that now is flushing not dependant of the exit code, and you
  cannot only flush async threads operations which we deemed as a strange
  behaviour anyway.

  Also, erlang:halt/1,2 has gotten a new feature: If the first argument is the
  atom 'abort' the emulator is aborted producing a core dump, if the operating
  system so allows.

  reproducing a specific series for a given seed will fail. The pseudo random
  output is still deterministic but different compared to earlier versions.

- Calls to `global:whereis_name/1` have been substituted for calls to
  `global:safe_whereis_name/1` since the latter is not safe at all.

  The reason for not doing this earlier is that setting a global lock masked out
  a bug concerning the restart of supervised children. The bug has now been
  fixed by a modification of `global:whereis_name/1`. (Thanks to Ulf Wiger for
  code contribution.)

  A minor race conditions in `gen_fsm:start*` has been fixed: if one of these
  functions returned `{error, Reason}` or ignore, the name could still be
  registered (either locally or in `global`. (This is the same modification as

  information on the callback attribute Automatically generate 'behaviour_info'
  function from '-callback' attributes

  'behaviour_info(callbacks)' is a special function that is defined in a module
  which describes a behaviour and returns a list of its callbacks.

  This function is now automatically generated using the '-callback' specs. An
  error is returned by lint if user defines both '-callback' attributes and the
  behaviour_info/1 function. If no type info is needed for a callback use a
  generic spec for it. Add '-callback' attribute to language syntax

  Behaviours may define specs for their callbacks using the familiar spec
  syntax, replacing the '-spec' keyword with '-callback'. Simple lint checks are
  performed to ensure that no callbacks are defined twice and all types referred
  are declared.

  These attributes can be then used by tools to provide documentation to the
  behaviour or find discrepancies in the callback definitions in the callback
  module.

- Explicitly kill dynamic children in supervisors

  According to the supervisor's documentation: "Important note on
  simple-one-for-one supervisors: The dynamically created child processes of a
  simple-one-for-one supervisor are not explicitly killed, regardless of
  shutdown strategy, but are expected to terminate when the supervisor does
  (that is, when an exit signal from the parent process is received)."

  All is fine as long as we stop simple_one_for_one supervisor manually. Dynamic
  children catch the exit signal from the supervisor and leave. But, if this
  happens when we stop an application, after the top supervisor has stopped, the
  application master kills all remaining processes associated to this
  application. So, dynamic children that trap exit signals can be killed during
  their cleanup (here we mean inside terminate/2). This is unpredictable and
  highly time-dependent.

  In this commit, supervisor module is patched to explicitly terminate dynamic
  children accordingly to the shutdown strategy.

  NOTE: Order in which dynamic children are stopped is not defined. In fact,
  this is "almost" done at the same time.

  Stack errors when dynamic children are stopped

  Because a simple_one_for_one supervisor can have many workers, we stack errors
  during its shutdown to report only one message for each encountered error
  type. Instead of reporting the child's pid, we use the number of concerned
  children. (Thanks to Christopher Faulet)

  Own Id: OTP-9647

- Allow an infinite timeout to shutdown worker processes

  Now, in child specification, the shutdown value can also be set to infinity

  (Thanks to Christopher Faulet)

- Variables are now now allowed in '`fun M:F/A`' as suggested by Richard O'Keefe

  The representation of '`fun M:F/A`' in the abstract format has been changed in
  an incompatible way. Tools that directly read or manipulate the abstract
  format (such as parse transforms) may need to be updated. The compiler can
  handle both the new and the old format (i.e. extracting the abstract format
  from a pre-R15 BEAM file and compiling it using compile:forms/1,2 will work).

- fix supervisors restarting temporary children

  In the current implementation of supervisors, temporary children should never
  be restarted. However, when a temporary child is restarted as part of a
  one_for_all or rest_for_one strategy where the failing process is not the
  temporary child, the supervisor still tries to restart it.

  Because the supervisor doesn't keep some of the MFA information of temporary
  children, this causes the supervisor to hit its restart limit and crash.

  This patch fixes the behaviour by inserting a clause in terminate_children/2-3
  (private function) that will omit temporary children when building a list of
  killed processes, to avoid having the supervisor trying to restart them again.

  Only supervisors in need of restarting children used the list, so the change
  should be of no impact for the functions that called terminate_children/2-3
  only to kill all children.

  The documentation has been modified to make this behaviour more explicit.

- Update index file atomically

  Since the log_mf_h index file might be read by other processes than the error
  handler (e.g. by the rb tool), this file should be updated atomically. This
  will avoid hitting the time gap between opening the file in write mode (and
  thus emptying the file) and the actual update with the new contents. To do
  this, a temporary file is written, and the file:rename/1 used to replace the
  real index file.

- Supervisors should not save child-specs for temporary processes when they
  terminate as they should not be restarted. Saving the temporary child spec
  will result in that you cannot start a new temporary process with the same
  child spec as an already terminated temporary process. Since R14B02 you cannot
  restart a temporary temporary process as arguments are no longer saved, it has
  however always been semantically incorrect to restart a temporary process.

  The pool module prints out an error message and takes no further action for

  attach to the node is still made. This makes sense because the node has been
  specified by the user in the .hosts.erlang file indicating a wish for the node
  to be part of the pool and a manual attach can be successfully made after the
  pool is started.(Thanks to Kelly McLaughlin)

  Own Id: OTP-7863

- Large parts of the `ethread` library have been rewritten. The `ethread`
  library is an Erlang runtime system internal, portable thread library used by
  the runtime system itself.

  Most notable improvement is a reader optimized rwlock implementation which
  dramatically improve the performance of read-lock/read-unlock operations on
  multi processor systems by avoiding ping-ponging of the rwlock cache lines.
  The reader optimized rwlock implementation is used by miscellaneous rwlocks in
  the runtime system that are known to be read-locked frequently, and can be
  enabled on ETS tables by passing the
  [\{read_concurrency, true\}](`m:ets#new_2_read_concurrency`) option upon table
  creation. See the documentation of `ets:new/2` for more information. The
  reader optimized rwlock implementation can be fine tuned when starting the
  runtime system. For more information, see the documentation of the
  [\+rg](`e:erts:erl_cmd.md#%2Brg`) command line argument of `erl`.

  There is also a new implementation of rwlocks that is not optimized for
  readers. Both implementations interleaves readers and writers during
  contention as opposed to, e.g., the NPTL (Linux) pthread rwlock implementation
  which use either a reader or writer preferred strategy. The reader/writer
  preferred strategy is problematic since it starves threads doing the
  non-preferred operation.

  The new rwlock implementations in general performs better in ERTS than common
  pthread implementations. However, in some extremely heavily contended cases
  this is not the case. Such heavy contention can more or less only appear on
  ETS tables. This when multiple processes do very large amounts of write locked
  operations simultaneously on the same table. Such use of ETS is bad regardless
  of rwlock implementation, will never scale, and is something we strongly
  advise against.

  The new rwlock implementations depend on atomic operations. If no native
  atomic implementation is found, a fallback solution will be used. Using the
  fallback implies a performance degradation. That is, it is more important now
  than before to build OTP with a native atomic implementation.

  The `ethread` library contains native atomic implementations for, x86 (32 and
  64 bit), powerpc (32 bit), sparc V9 (32 and 64 bit), and tilera (32 bit). On
  other hardware gcc's builtin support for atomic memory access will be used if
  such exists. If no such support is found, `configure` will warn about no
  atomic implementation available.

  The `ethread` library can now also use the `libatomic_ops` library for atomic
  memory accesses. This makes it possible for the Erlang runtime system to
  utilize optimized native atomic operations on more platforms than before. If
  `configure` warns about no atomic implementation available, try using the
  `libatomic_ops` library. Use the
  [\--with-libatomic_ops=PATH](`e:system:install.md#advanced-configuration-and-build-of-erlang-otp`)
  `configure` command line argument when specifying where the `libatomic_ops`
  installation is located. The `libatomic_ops` library can be downloaded from:
  [http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/atomic_ops/](http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/atomic_ops/)

  The changed API of the `ethread` library has also caused modifications in the
  Erlang runtime system. Preparations for the to come "delayed deallocation"
  feature has also been done since it depends on the `ethread` library.

  _Note_: When building for x86, the `ethread` library will now use instructions
  that first appeared on the pentium 4 processor. If you want the runtime system
  to be compatible with older processors (back to 486) you need to pass the
  [\--enable-ethread-pre-pentium4-compatibility](`e:system:install.md#advanced-configuration-and-build-of-erlang-otp`)
  `configure` command line argument when configuring the system.

  Added functions to create and extract escripts. See `escript:create/2` and

- Local and imported functions now override the auto-imported BIFs when the
  names clash. The pre R14 behaviour was that auto-imported BIFs would override
  local functions. To avoid that old programs change behaviour, the following
  will generate an error:

  - Doing a call without explicit module name to a local function having a name
    clashing with the name of an auto-imported BIF that was present (and
    auto-imported) before OTP R14A
  - Explicitly importing a function having a name clashing with the name of an
    autoimported BIF that was present (and autoimported) before OTP R14A
  - Using any form of the old compiler directive `nowarn_bif_clash`

  If the BIF was added or auto-imported in OTP R14A or later, overriding it with
  an import or a local function will only result in a warning,

  To resolve clashes, you can either use the explicit module name `erlang` to
  call the BIF, or you can remove the auto-import of that specific BIF by using
  the new compiler directive `-compile({no_auto_import,[F/A]}).`, which makes
  all calls to the local or imported function without explicit module name pass
  without warnings or errors.

  The change makes it possible to add auto-imported BIFs without breaking or
  silently changing old code in the future. However some current code
  ingeniously utilizing the old behaviour or the `nowarn_bif_clash` compiler
  directive, might need changing to be accepted by the compiler.

## STDLIB 1.16.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- The text of tokens returned by the Erlang scanner (`erl_scan`) was sometimes
  empty when the `text` option was given and `StartLocation` was a line. This
  bug has been fixed.

  Own Id: OTP-7965

- The documentation for `base64:decode/1` has been updated to point out that it
  strips whitespace.

  `base64:decode/1` and `base64:mime_decode/1` would sometimes fail instead of
  stripping away non-base64 characters.

  Own Id: OTP-7895

### Improvements and New Features

- The Erlang scanner no longer returns the text of tokens when the start
  location is a pair of a line and column unless the new option `text` is

## STDLIB 1.16

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixed a minor race conditions in `gen_server:start*`: if one of these
  functions returned `{error,Reason}` or `ignore`, the name could still be
  registered (either locally or in `global`).

  A process started by `proc_lib` in some cases depended on its process
  dictionary not to be erased, and would crash when terminating abnormally and
  not generate a proper crash report. This has been corrected (but the initial
  call will not be shown in the error report if the process dictionary has been
  erased). NOTE: There is no longer any need to erase the process dictionary for
  memory conservation reasons, since the actual call arguments are no longer
  saved in the process dictionary.

  Own Id: OTP-7714

### Improvements and New Features

- A new option, `key_equality`, has been added to `qlc:table/2`. This option
  makes it possible for `qlc` to better handle tables that use `==/2` when
  comparing keys for equality (examples of such tables are ordered ETS tables
  and gb_table in qlc(3)).

- Support for Unicode is implemented as described in EEP10. Formatting and
  reading of unicode data both from terminals and files is supported by the io
  and io_lib modules. Files can be opened in modes with automatic translation to
  and from different unicode formats. The module 'unicode' contains functions
  for conversion between external and internal unicode formats and the re module
  has support for unicode data. There is also language syntax for specifying
  string and character data beyond the ISO-latin-1 range.

  The interactive shell will support input and output of unicode characters when
  the terminal and operating system supports it.

  Please see the EEP and the io/io_lib manual pages as well as the stdlib users
  guide for details.

  _I/O-protocol incompatibilities:_

  The io_protocol between io_Server and client is updated to handle protocol
  data in unicode formats. The updated protocol is now documented. The
  specification resides in the stdlib _users manual_, which is a new part of the
  manual.

  _io module incompatibilities:_

  The io:put_chars, io:get_chars and io:get_line all handle and return unicode
  data. In the case where binaries can be provided (as to io:put_chars), they
  shall be encoded in UTF-8. When binaries are returned (as by
  io:get_line/get_chars when the io_server is set in _binary mode_) the returned
  data is also _always_ encoded as UTF-8. The file module however still returns
  byte-oriented data, why file:read can be used instead of io:get_chars to read
  binary data in ISO-latin-1.

  _io_lib module incompatibilities:_

  io_lib:format can, given new format directives (i.e "~ts" and "~tc"), return
  lists containing integers larger than 255.

- When a process started with `proc_lib`, `gen_server`, or `gen_fsm` exits with
  reason `{shutdown,Term}`, a crash report will no longer be generated (to allow

  function.)

  Own Id: OTP-7752

- `lists:suffix(Suffix, List)` used to have a a complexity of
  `length(Suffix)*length(List)` (which could become quite slow for some inputs).
  It has now been re-implemented so that its complexity is
  `length(Suffix)+length(List)`. (Thanks to Richard O'Keefe for the new
  implementation.)

  Own Id: OTP-7797

- The Erlang scanner has been augmented as to return white spaces, comments, and
  exact location of tokens. The functions `string/3`, `tokens/4`, and
  `token_info/1,2` are new. See erl_scan(3) for details.

  `tokens/3,4` have been modified as to return a list of tokens instead of an
  error when `eof` is encountered before the dot.

  Own Id: OTP-7810

- `filelib:fold_files/5` now uses the `re` module instead of the `regexp` module
  for regular expression matching. In practice, this change will not be a
  problem for most regular expressions used for `filelib:fold_files/5`. (The
  major difference in regular expression is that parenthesis and curly brackets
  is treated as literal characters by `regexp` but as special characters by
  `re`; fortunately, those characters are rarely used in filenames.)

  something was wrong.)

  Own Id: OTP-7514 Aux Id: OTP-7494

- Processes spawned using `proc_lib` (including `gen_server` and other library
  modules that use `proc_lib`) no longer keep the entire argument list for the
  initial call, but only the arity.

  Also, if `proc_lib:spawn/1` is used to spawn a fun, the actual fun is not
  kept, but only module, function name, and arity of the function that
  implements the fun.

  The reason for the change is that keeping the initial fun (or a fun in an
  argument list), would prevent upgrading the code for the module. A secondary
  reason is that keeping the fun and function arguments could waste a
  significant amount of memory.

  The drawback with the change is that the crash reports will provide less
  precise information about the initial call (only `Module:Function/Arity`
  instead of `Module:Function(Arguments)`). The function
  `proc_lib:initial_call/1` still returns a list, but each argument has been
  replaced with a dummy atom.

- There is now experimental support for loading of code from archive files. See
  the documentation of `code`, `init`, `erl_prim_loader `and `escript` for more

  The error handling of `escripts` has been improved.

  An `escript` may now set explicit arguments to the emulator, such as
  `-smp enabled`.

  An `escript` may now contain a precompiled beam file.

  An `escript` may now contain an archive file containing one or more

- A bug in the calendar module could cause
  calendar:local_time_to_universal_time_dst/1 to return duplicate identical
  values for local times in timezones without DST. Multiple values should only
  be returned when a local time is within the hour occurring twice due to shift
  from DST to non-DST, and certainly only in timezones with DST. The correct

### Improvements and New Features

- The `queue` module has been rewritten to make it easier to use. Suggestions
  and discussion from and with among others Lev Walkin, Anders Ramsell and Rober
  Virding in december 2007 on erlang-questions@erlang.org. It was also discussed
  to change the internal representation to contain length information which
  would speed up `len/1` but that change has been postponed. Anyone interested
  may write an EEP and try to reach an acceptable compromise for queue overhead
  and thereby the speed of all other operations than `len/1`. The `queue` module
  is now optimized for fast and minimal garbage `in/2` and `out/1` and such. See
  the documentation.

  New functions: `is_queue/1`, [`get/1`](`get/1`), `get_r/1`, `peek/1`,
  `peek_r/1`, `drop/1`, `drop_r/1` and `liat/1`. `is_queue/1` is a new
  predicate, `liat/1` is a correction of an old misspelling, and the others
  (`get`\*, `peek`\* and `drop`\*) are new interface functions.

## STDLIB 1.15

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Bugs have been fixed in `qlc`:

  - Setting the `lookup_fun` option of `qlc:table/2` to `undefined` could cause
    a crash.
  - If a QLC restricted some column of a table in such a way that a traversal
    using a match specification was possible and the QLC also compared the key
    column or some indexed column of the the table with a column of some other
    table, `qlc` always chose to traverse the table first, never considering
    lookup join. This has been changed so that lookup join is always preferred;
    if an initial traversal using the match specification is desired, the query
    needs to be rewritten introducing an extra QLC with the filter(s)
    restricting the column.
  - When trying to find candidates for match specifications and lookup, filters
    using variables from one generator only are ignored unless they are placed
    immediately after the generator and possibly other filters using variables
    from the same generator. In particular, filters joining two tables should
    not be placed between the generator and the filters using the generator
    only.
  - The call-back function `TraverseFun` used for implementing QLC tables is
    allowed to return a term other than a list since STDLIB 1.14 (OTP-5195).
    However, when the returned term was a fun `qlc` often tried to call the fun
    instead of returning it.

  A few minor optimizations have been implemented as well.

  Own Id: OTP-6870

- file:write_file/3, file:write/2 and file:read/2 could crash (contrary to
  documentation) for odd enough file system problems, e.g write to full file
  system. This bug has now been corrected.

  In this process the file module has been rewritten to produce better error
  codes. Posix error codes now originate from the OS file system calls or are
  generated only for very similar causes (for example 'enomem' is generated if a
  memory allocation fails, and 'einval' is generated if the file handle in
  Erlang is a file handle but currently invalid).

  More Erlang-ish error codes are now generated. For example `{error,badarg}` is
  now returned from `file:close/1` if the argument is not of a file handle type.
  See file(3).

  The possibility to write a single byte using `file:write/2` instead of a list
  or binary of one byte, contradictory to the documentation, has been removed.

  Own Id: OTP-6977

### Improvements and New Features

- The behaviour of the internal functions gen:call/3,4 has been changed slightly
  in the rare case that when the caller was linked to the called server, and the
  server crashed during the call; its exit signal was consumed by the
  gen:call/3,4 code and converted to an exit exception. This exit signal is no
  longer consumed.

  To even notice this change, 1) the calling process has to be linked to the
  called server.

  2. the call must not be remote by name that is it must be local or remote by
     pid, local by name or global by name.

  3. the calling process has to have set
     [`process_flag(trap_exit, true)`](`process_flag/2`).

  4. the server has to crash during the call.

  5. the calling process has to be sensitive to getting previously consumed
     `{'EXIT',Pid,Reason}` messages in its message queue.

  The old behaviour was once the only way for a client to notice if the server
  died, but has since `erlang:monitor(process, {Name,Node})` was introduced and
  used in gen:call been regarded as an undesired behaviour if not a bug.

  The affected user APIs are: `gen_server:call/2,3`,
  `gen_fsm:sync_send_event/2,3`, `gen_fsm:sync_send_all_state_event/2,3`,
  `gen_event:_`, `sys:_` and maybe a few others that hardly will be noticed.

  These changes affect the Erlang shell when running in restricted mode: the
  callback function `non_local_allowed/3` is now called for operators such as
  `'!'/2`. This means that `non_local_allowed/3` may need to
  be changed as to let operators through. Note that `erlang:'!'/2` as well as
  `erlang:send/2,3` have to be restricted in order to stop message passing in
  the shell.

  This limitation has now been properly documented and the behavior of the

  Own Id: OTP-6345

### Improvements and New Features

- The control sequence `P` of the `Format` argument of the functions
  `io:fwrite/2,3` and `io_lib:fwrite/2` now replaces the tail of binary strings
  with `...` when the maximum depth has been reached. For instance,
  `io:fwrite("~P", [<<"a binary string">>, 3]).` prints `<<"a binary"...>>`.

  The indentation takes more care not to exceed the right margin, if possible.

  If the maximum depth is reached while printing a tuple, `,...` is printed
  instead of `|...` (this change applies to the control sequence `W` as well).

  Own Id: OTP-6277

### Improvements and New Features

- Support for faster join of two tables has been added to the `qlc` module.
  There are two kinds of fast joins: lookup join that uses existing indices, and
  merge join that takes two sorted inputs. There is a new `join` option that can
  be used to force QLC to use a particular kind of join in some QLC expression.

  Several other changes have also been included:

  - The new `tmpdir` option of `cursor/2`, `eval/2`, `fold/4`, and `info/2` can
    be used to set the directory that join uses for temporary files. The option
    also overrides the `tmpdir` option of `keysort/3` and `sort/2`.
  - The new `lookup` option can be used to assert that constants are looked up
    when evaluating some QLC expression.
  - The `cache` and `cache_all` options accept new tags: `ets`, `list`, and
    `no`. The tag `list` caches answers in a list using a temporary file if the
    answers cannot be held in RAM. Combining `{cache,list}` and `{unique, true}`
    is equivalent to calling `sort/2` with the option `unique` set to `true`.
    The old tags `true` (equivalent to `ets`) and `false` (equivalent to `no`)
    are recognized for backward compatibility.
  - The new option `max_list_size` can be used to set the limit where merge join
    starts to use temporary files for large equivalence classes and when answers
    cached in lists are put on temporary files.
  - There is a new callback `is_sorted_key` to be supplied as an option to
    `table/2`.
  - QLC analyzes each and every QLC expression when trying to find constants for
    the lookup function. Hitherto only QLC expressions with exactly one
    generator were analyzed.

    Note that only filters with guard syntax placed immediately after the
    generator are analyzed. The restriction to guard filters is an incompatible
    change. See `m:qlc` for further details.

  - In a similar way several match specifications for traversal of QLC tables
    can be utilized for different generators of one single QLC expression.
  - A bug has been fixed: when caching answers to a sufficiently complex query
    it could happen that some answers were not returned.

- The Erlang shell now tries to garbage collect large binaries. Under certain
  circumstances such binaries could otherwise linger on for an indefinite amount
  of time.

  Own Id: OTP-6239

- To help Dialyzer find more bugs, many functions in the Kernel and STDLIB
  applications now only accept arguments of the type that is documented.

  For instance, the functions `lists:prefix/2` and `lists:suffix/2` are
  documented to only accept lists as their arguments, but they actually accepted
  anything and returned `false`. That has been changed so that the functions
  cause an exception if one or both arguments are not lists.

  Also, the `string:strip/3` function is documented to take a character argument
  that is a character to strip from one or both ends of the string. Given a list
  instead of a character, it used to do nothing, but will now cause an
  exception.

  Dialyzer will find most cases where those functions are passed arguments of
  the wrong type.

## STDLIB 1.14

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- A bugfix in QLC: two of the call-back functions used for implementing QLC
  tables, `TraverseFun` and `LookupFun`, are now allowed to return a term other
  than a list. Such a term is immediately returned as the results of the current
  query, and is useful mostly for returning error tuples.

  Several other minor bugs have been also been fixed.

  such a way that two tuples are considered equal if their keys match.

  For the sake of consistency, `lists:usort/2` and `lists:umerge/3` have been
  modified too: two elements are considered equal if they compare equal.

  The `file_sorter` module has been modified in a similar way: the `unique`
  option now applies to the key (`keysort()` and `keymerge()`) and the ordering
  function (the option `{order, Order} `).

### Improvements and New Features

- Improvements of the linter:

  - The `compile` attribute is recognized after function definitions.
  - The new compiler option `nowarn_deprecated_function` can be used for turning
    off warnings for calls to deprecated functions.
  - The new compiler option `{nowarn_unused_function,[{Name,Arity}]}` turns off
    warnings for unused local functions for the mentioned functions. The new
    options `{nowarn_deprecated_function,[{Module,Name,Arity}]}` and
    `{nowarn_bif_clash,[{Name,Arity}]}` work similarly.

  The Erlang code preprocessor `epp` now recognizes the `file` attribute. This
  attribute is meant to be used by tools such as Yecc that generate source code
  files.

- When given the new option '`strict_record_tests`', the compiler will generate
  code that verifies the record type for '`R#record.field`' operations in

- Replaced some tuple funs with the new `fun M:F/A` construct.

  The high-order functions in the lists module no longer accept bad funs under
  any circumstances. '`lists:map(bad_fun, [])`' used to return '`[]`' but now
  causes an exception.

  Unused, broken compatibility code in the `ets` module was removed. (Thanks to
  Dialyzer.)

  Eliminated 5 discrepancies found by Dialyzer in the Appmon application.

- The `c:i/0` function will now run in a paged mode if there are more than 100
  processes in the system. (Thanks to Ulf Wiger.)

  `erlang:system_info(process_count)` has been optimized and does now return
  exactly the same value as [`length(processes())`](`length/1`). Previously
  `erlang:system_info(process_count)` did not include exiting processes which
  are included in [`length(processes())`](`length/1`).

  The `+P` flag for `erl`, which sets the maximum number of processes allowed to
  exist at the same, no longer accepts values higher than 134217727. (You will
  still probably run out of memory before you'll be able to reach that limit.)

## STDLIB 1.13.8

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Very minor corrections in `beam_lib` and its documentation.

  Own Id: OTP-5589

### Improvements and New Features

- The `erlang:port_info/1` BIF is now documented. Minor corrections of the
  documentation for `erlang:port_info/2`.

  Added a note to the documentation of the `math` module that all functions are
  not available on all platforms.

  Added more information about the '`+c`' option in the `erl` man page in the
  ERTS documentation.

- The new `fun M:F/A` construct creates a fun that refers to the latest version
  of `M:F/A`. This syntax is meant to replace tuple funs `{M,F}` which have many
  problems.

  The new type test [`is_function(Fun,A)`](`is_function/2`) (which may be used
  in guards) test whether `Fun` is a fun that can be applied with `A` arguments.
  (Currently, `Fun` can also be a tuple fun.)

## STDLIB 1.13.7

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- `filelib:wildcard/2` was broken (it ignored its second argument).

  Also, `filelib:wildcard("Filename")` (where the argument does not contain any
  meta-characters) would always return `["Filename"]`. Corrected so that an
  empty list will be returned if `"Filename"` does not actually exist. (Same
  correction in `filelib:wildcard/2`.) (This change is a slight
  incompatibility.)

  `filelib:wildcard/1,2` will generate a different exception when given bad
  patterns such as `"{a,"`. The exception used to be caused by
  '[`exit(missing_delimiter)`](`exit/1`)' but is now
  '`erlang:error({badpattern,missing_delimiter})`'.

### Improvements and New Features

- Further improvements of encrypted debug info: New option `encrypt_debug_info`
  for compiler.

  Own Id: OTP-5541 Aux Id: seq9837

## STDLIB 1.13.6

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- When opening a Dets table read only an attempt was sometimes made to re-hash
  the table resulting in an error message. This problem has been fixed.

  Own Id: OTP-5487 Aux Id: OTP-4989

### Improvements and New Features

- It is now possible to encrypt the debug information in Beam files, to help
  keep the source code secret. See the documentation for `compile` on how to
  provide the key for encrypting, and the documentation for `beam_lib` on how to
  provide the key for decryption so that tools such as the Debugger, Xref, or
  Cover can be used.

  The `beam_lib:chunks/2` functions now accepts an additional chunk type
  `compile_info` to retrieve the compilation information directly as a term.
  (Thanks to Tobias Lindahl.)

## STDLIB 1.13.5

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Closing a Dets table kept in RAM would cause a crash if the file could not be
  written. This problem has been fixed by returning an error tuple.

  Own Id: OTP-5402

- `erl_pp` now correctly pretty-prints `fun F/A`.

  Own Id: OTP-5412

- The Erlang shell failed if the compiler was not in the code path. This problem
  has been fixed, but in order to evaluate records the compiler is still needed.

  Own Id: OTP-5435

- Corrected the example in the documentation for `ets:match/2`. Also clarified
  that `ets:update_counter/3` updates the counter atomically. (Thanks to Anders
  Svensson.)

  Own Id: OTP-5452 Aux Id: seq9770, seq9789

### Improvements and New Features

- The possibility to start the Erlang shell in parallel with the rest of the
  system was reintroduced for backwards compatibility in STDLIB 1.13.1. The flag
  to be used for this is now called `async_shell_start` and has been documented.
  New shells started from the JCL menu are not synchronized with `init` anymore.
  This makes it possible to start a new shell (e.g. for debugging purposes) even
  if the initial shell has not come up.

  Own Id: OTP-5406 Aux Id: OTP-5218

- The compiler will now produce warnings when using the deprecated functions in
  the `snmp` module.

  Own Id: OTP-5425

- The function `c:zi/0` has been removed. Use `c:i/0` instead.

  Own Id: OTP-5432

- Corrected two minor bugs found by the Dialyzer: Calling a parameterized module
  from a restricted shell (i.e. if `shell:start_restricted/1` has been used)
  would crash the shell evaluator. A debug printout in `gen_fsm` had a clause
  that would never match; causing less information to be printed.

  And a somewhat more serious one also found by Dialyzer: `rpc:yield/1` would
  crash unless the call started by `rpc:async_call/4` had already finished;
  `rpc:nb_yield(Key,infinity)` would also crash.

  Cleaned up and removed redundant code found by Dialyzer in
  `erlang:dmonitor_p/2`.

## STDLIB 1.13.4

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Bugs in the Erlang shell have been fixed.

  Own Id: OTP-5327

- Some dead code reported by Dialyzer was eliminated.

  A bug in `dbg` when tracing to wrap trace files has been corrected. It failed
  to delete any already existing wrap trace files with the same names when
  starting a new wrap trace.

  Own Id: OTP-5329

- The linter could output invalid warnings about bit patterns in record
  initializations. This problem has been fixed.

  Own Id: OTP-5338

- `ordsets:is_set(NoList)`, where `NoList` is any term except a list, would
  crash. For consistency with `sets:is_set/1` and `gb_sets:is_set/1`, it now
  returns `false`.

  Own Id: OTP-5341

- A BIF `erlang:raise/3` has been added. See the manual for details. It is
  intended for internal system programming only, advanced error handling.

  Own Id: OTP-5376 Aux Id: OTP-5257

### Improvements and New Features

- The `deprecated` attribute is now checked by the linter. See `m:xref` for a
  description of the `deprecated` attribute.

  Own Id: OTP-5276

- The restricted shell will now indicate if the return value from a user
  predicate is on an incorrect form.

  Own Id: OTP-5335

## STDLIB 1.13.3

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Bugs concerning unused and shadowed variables have been fixed in the linter.

  Own Id: OTP-5091

- A bug in the evaluator that caused the shell to choke on bit syntax
  expressions has been fixed.

  Own Id: OTP-5237

- `io:format/2` et.al no longer crashes for some combinations of precision and
  value for format character "g". Previously it crashed if the precision P was 4
  or lower and the absolute value of the float to print was lower than 10^4 but
  10^(P-1) or higher. Now it will not crash depending on the value of the float.

  Own Id: OTP-5263

- Bugs in the handling of the bit syntax have been fixed in the Erlang shell.

  Own Id: OTP-5269

- `gb_sets:del_element/2` was changed to do the same as `gb_sets:delete_any/2`
  which was the original intention, not as `gb_sets:delete/2`. Code that relies
  on `gb_sets:del_element/2` causing an error if the element does not exist must
  be changed to call `gb_sets:delete/2` instead.

  The documentation was also updated to explicitly document functions that were
  only referred to as 'aliases' of a documented function. Also, a list of all
  functions common to the `gb_sets`, `sets`, and `ordsets` was added.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-5277

- Debug messages have been removed from the QLC module.

  Own Id: OTP-5283

### Improvements and New Features

- The size of continuations returned from `dets:match/1,3`,
  `dets:match_object/1,3`, and `dets:select/1,3` has been reduced. This affects
  the amount of data Mnesia sends between nodes while evaluating QLC queries.

  Own Id: OTP-5232

## STDLIB 1.13.2

### Improvements and New Features

- The `-rsh` switch for starting a remote shell (introduced with OTP-5210)
  clashed with an already existing switch used by `slave`. Therefore the switch
  for the remote shell is now instead named `-remsh`.

  Own Id: OTP-5248 Aux Id: OTP-5210

## STDLIB 1.13.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- The Pman 'trace shell' functionality was broken as has now been fixed.
  Furthermore, Pman could not correctly find the pid of the active shell if more
  than one shell process was running on the node. This has also been corrected.

  Own Id: OTP-5191

- When the undocumented feature "parameterized modules" was used, the ?MODULE
  macro did not work correctly.

  Own Id: OTP-5224

### Improvements and New Features

- You can now start Erlang with the `-rsh` flag which gives you a remote initial
  shell instead of a local one. Example:

  ```text
              erl -sname this_node -rsh other_node@other_host
  ```

  Own Id: OTP-5210

- The man page for the `lists` module has been updated with description of the
  new `zip`, `unzip`, and `partition/2` functions.

  Own Id: OTP-5213

- The top level group leader used to be listed as job #1 in the job list in JCL
  mode. Since there is no shell associated with this process that can be
  connected to, it will no longer be listed.

  Own Id: OTP-5214

- The possibility to start the Erlang shell in parallel with the rest of the
  system has been reintroduced for backwards compatibility. Note that this old
  behaviour is error prone and should not be used unless for some reason
  necessary.

  Own Id: OTP-5218 Aux Id: seq9534

- The `shell` commands `rr/1,2,3` now accepts wildcards when reading record
  definitions from BEAM files.
