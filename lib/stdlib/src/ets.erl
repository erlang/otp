Built-in term storage.

This module is an interface to the Erlang built-in term storage BIFs. These
provide the ability to store very large quantities of data in an Erlang runtime
system, and to have constant access time to the data. (In the case of
`ordered_set`, see below, access time is proportional to the logarithm of the
number of stored objects.)

Data is organized as a set of dynamic tables, which can store tuples. Each table
is created by a process. When the process terminates, the table is automatically
destroyed. Every table has access rights set at creation.

Tables are divided into four different types, `set`, `ordered_set`, `bag`, and
`duplicate_bag`. A `set` or `ordered_set` table can only have one object
associated with each key. A `bag` or `duplicate_bag` table can have many objects
associated with each key.

Insert and lookup times in tables of type `set` are constant, regardless of the
table size. For table types `bag` and `duplicate_bag` time is proportional to
the number of objects with the same key. Even seemingly unrelated keys may
inflict linear search to be skipped past while looking for the key of interest
(due to hash collision).

> #### Warning {: .warning }
>
> For tables of type `bag` and `duplicate_bag`, avoid inserting an extensive
> amount of objects with the same key. It will hurt insert and lookup
> performance as well as real time characteristics of the runtime environment
> (hash bucket linear search do not yield).

The `ordered_set` table type uses a binary search tree. Insert and lookup times
are proportional to the logarithm of the number of objects in the table.

[](){: #max_ets_tables }

> #### Note {: .info }
>
> The number of tables stored at one Erlang node _used_ to be limited. This is
> no longer the case (except by memory usage). The previous default limit was
> about 1400 tables and could be increased by setting the environment variable
> `ERL_MAX_ETS_TABLES` or the command line option
> [`+e`](`e:erts:erl_cmd.md#%2Be`) before starting the Erlang runtime system.
> This hard limit has been removed, but it is currently useful to set the
> `ERL_MAX_ETS_TABLES` anyway. It should be set to an approximate of the maximum
> amount of tables used since an internal table for named tables is sized using
> this value. If large amounts of named tables are used and `ERL_MAX_ETS_TABLES`
> hasn't been increased, the performance of named table lookup will degrade.

Notice that there is no automatic garbage collection for tables. Even if there
are no references to a table from any process, it is not automatically destroyed
unless the owner process terminates. To destroy a table explicitly, use function
`delete/1`. The default owner is the process that created the table. To transfer
table ownership at process termination, use option [`heir`](`m:ets#heir`) or
call `give_away/3`.

Some implementation details:

- In the current implementation, every object insert and look-up operation
  results in a copy of the object.
- `'$end_of_table'` is not to be used as a key, as this atom is used to mark the
  end of the table when using functions `first/1` and `next/2`.

Notice the subtle difference between _matching_ and _comparing equal_, which is
demonstrated by table types `set` and `ordered_set`:

- Two Erlang terms `match` if they are of the same type and have the same value,
  so that `1` matches `1`, but not `1.0` (as `1.0` is a `t:float/0` and not an
  `t:integer/0`).
- Two Erlang terms _compare equal_ if they either are of the same type and
  value, or if both are numeric types and extend to the same value, so that `1`
  compares equal to both `1` and `1.0`.
- The `ordered_set` works on the _Erlang term order_ and no defined order exists
  between an `t:integer/0` and a `t:float/0` that extends to the same value.
  Hence the key `1` and the key `1.0` are regarded as equal in an `ordered_set`
  table.

[](){: #ets_failures }

## Failures

Functions in this module fail by raising an error exception with error reason:

- **`badarg`** - If any argument has the wrong format.

- **`badarg`** - If the table identifier is invalid.

- **`badarg`** - If the operation is denied because of table access rights
  ([protected](`m:ets#protected`) or [private](`m:ets#private`)).

- **`system_limit`** - Modification of a value causes it to not be representable
  internally in the VM. For example, incrementation of a counter past the
  largest integer representable.

- **`system_limit`** - If a match specification passed as argument has excessive
  nesting which causes scheduler stack exhaustion for the scheduler that the
  calling process is executing on.
  [Scheduler stack size](`e:erts:erl_cmd.md#sched_thread_stack_size`) can be
  configured when starting the runtime system.

[](){: #concurrency }

## Concurrency

This module provides some limited support for concurrent access. All updates to
single objects are guaranteed to be both _atomic_ and _isolated_. This means
that an updating operation to a single object either succeeds or fails
completely without any effect (atomicity) and that no intermediate results of
the update can be seen by other processes (isolation). Some functions that
update many objects state that they even guarantee atomicity and isolation for
the entire operation. In database terms the isolation level can be seen as
"serializable", as if all isolated operations are carried out serially, one
after the other in a strict order.

[](){: #traversal }

## Table traversal

There are different ways to traverse through the objects of a table.

- _Single-step_ traversal one key at at time, using `first/1`, `next/2`,
  `last/1` and `prev/2`.
- _Single-step_ traversal one key at at time, but using `first_lookup/1`,
  `next_lookup/2`, `last_lookup/1` and `prev_lookup/2`. This is more efficient
  when you also need to lookup the objects for the keys.
- Search with simple _match patterns_, using [`match/1/2/3`](`match/1`),
  `match_delete/2` and [`match_object/1/2/3`](`match_object/1`).
- Search with more powerful _match specifications_, using
  [`select/1/2/3`](`select/1`), `select_count/2`, `select_delete/2`,
  `select_replace/2` and [`select_reverse/1/2/3`](`select_reverse/1`).
- _Table conversions_, using [`tab2file/2/3`](`tab2file/2`) and `tab2list/1`.

No table traversal will guarantee a consistent snapshot of the entire table if
the table is also updated by concurrent processes during the traversal. The
result of each concurrently updated object may be seen (or not) depending on if
it has happened when the traversal visits that part of the table. The only way
to guarantee a full consistent table snapshot (if you really need that) is to
disallow concurrent updates during the entire traversal.

Moreover, traversals not done in a _safe_ way, on tables where keys are inserted
or deleted during the traversal, may yield the following undesired effects:

- Any key may be missed.
- Any key may be found more than once.
- The traversal may fail with `badarg` exception if keys are deleted.

A table traversal is _safe_ if either

- the table is of type `ordered_set`.
- the entire table traversal is done within one ETS function call.
- function `safe_fixtable/2` is used to keep the table fixated during the entire
  traversal.

> #### Note {: .info }
>
> Even though the access of a single object is always guaranteed to be
> [atomic and isolated](`m:ets#module-concurrency`), each traversal through a table to
> find the next key is not done with such guarantees. This is often not a
> problem, but may cause rare subtle "unexpected" effects if a concurrent
> process inserts objects during a traversal. For example, consider one process
> doing
>
> ```erlang
> ets:new(t, [ordered_set, named_table]),
> ets:insert(t, {1}),
> ets:insert(t, {2}),
> ets:insert(t, {3}),
> ```
>
> A concurrent call to `ets:first(t)`, done by another process, may then in rare
> cases return `2` even though `2` has never existed in the table ordered as the
> first key. In the same way, a concurrent call to `ets:next(t, 1)` may return
> `3` even though `3` never existed in the table ordered directly after `1`.
>
> Effects like this are improbable but possible. The probability will further be
> reduced (if not vanish) if table option
> [`write_concurrency`](`m:ets#new_2_write_concurrency`) is not enabled. This
> can also only be a potential concern for `ordered_set` where the traversal
> order is defined.

Traversals using `match` and `select` functions may not need to scan the entire
table depending on how the key is specified. A match pattern with a _fully bound
key_ (without any match variables) will optimize the operation to a single key
lookup without any table traversal at all. For `ordered_set` a _partially bound
key_ will limit the traversal to only scan a subset of the table based on term
order. A partially bound key is either a list or a tuple with a prefix that is
fully bound. Example:

```erlang
1> T = ets:new(t,[ordered_set]), ets:insert(T, {"555-1234", "John Smith"}).
true
2> %% Efficient search of all with area code 555
2> ets:match(T,{[$5,$5,$5,$- |'$1'],'$2'}).
[["1234","John Smith"]]
```

[](){: #match_spec }

## Match Specifications

Some of the functions use a _match specification_, `match_spec`. For a brief
explanation, see `select/2`. For a detailed description, see section
[Match Specifications in Erlang](`e:erts:match_spec.md`) in ERTS User's Guide.

A match specifications with excessive nesting will cause a
[`system_limit`](`m:ets#ets_failures`) error exception to be raised.

exception is raised.

In addition to the `{Item,Value}` pairs defined for `info/1`, the following
items are allowed:

- `Item=binary, Value=BinInfo`

  `BinInfo` is a list containing miscellaneous information about binaries kept
  by the table. This `Item` can be changed or removed without prior notice. In
  the current implementation `BinInfo` is a list of tuples
  `{BinaryId,BinarySize,BinaryRefcCount}`.

  Indicates if the table is fixed by any process.

  If the table is fixed using `safe_fixtable/2`, the call returns a tuple where
  `FixationTime` is the last time when the table changed from unfixed to fixed.

  The format and value of `FixationTime` depends on `Item`:

  - **`safe_fixed`** - `FixationTime` corresponds to the result returned by
    `erlang:timestamp/0` at the time of fixation. Notice that when the system
    uses single or multi
    [time warp modes](`e:erts:time_correction.md#time-warp-modes`) this can
    produce strange results, as the use of `safe_fixed` is not
    [time warp safe](`e:erts:time_correction.md#time-warp-safe-code`). Time warp
    safe code must use `safe_fixed_monotonic_time` instead.

  - **`safe_fixed_monotonic_time`** - `FixationTime` corresponds to the result
    returned by `erlang:monotonic_time/0` at the time of fixation. The use of
    `safe_fixed_monotonic_time` is
    [time warp safe](`e:erts:time_correction.md#time-warp-safe-code`).

  `Info` is a possibly empty lists of tuples `{Pid,RefCount}`, one tuple for
  every process the table is fixed by now. `RefCount` is the value of the
  reference counter and it keeps track of how many times the table has been
  fixed by the process.

  Table fixations are not limited to `safe_fixtable/2`. Temporary fixations may
  also be done by for example [traversing functions](`m:ets#traversal`) like
  `select` and `match`. Such table fixations are automatically released before
  the corresponding functions returns, but they may be seen by a concurrent call
  to `ets:info(T,safe_fixed|safe_fixed_monotonic_time)`.

  If the table is not fixed at all, the call returns `false`.

  Returns internal statistics about tables on an internal format used by OTP
  test suites. Not for production use.

Creates a new table and returns a table identifier that can be used in
subsequent operations. The table identifier can be sent to other processes so
that a table can be shared between different processes within a node.

Parameter `Options` is a list of options that specifies table type, access
rights, key position, and whether the table is named. Default values are used
for omitted options. This means that not specifying any options (`[]`) is the
same as specifying
`[set, protected, {keypos,1}, {heir,none}, {write_concurrency,false}, {read_concurrency,false}, {decentralized_counters,false}]`.

- **`set`** - The table is a `set` table: one key, one object, no order among
  objects. This is the default table type.

- **`ordered_set`** - The table is a `ordered_set` table: one key, one object,
  ordered in Erlang term order, which is the order implied by the < and >
  operators. Tables of this type have a somewhat different behavior in some
  situations than tables of other types. Most notably, the `ordered_set` tables
  regard keys as equal when they _compare equal_, not only when they match. This
  means that to an `ordered_set` table, `t:integer/0` `1` and `t:float/0` `1.0`
  are regarded as equal. This also means that the key used to lookup an element
  does not necessarily _match_ the key in the returned elements, if
  `t:float/0`'s and `t:integer/0`'s are mixed in keys of a table.

- **`bag`** - The table is a `bag` table, which can have many objects, but only
  one instance of each object, per key.

- **`duplicate_bag`** - The table is a `duplicate_bag` table, which can have
  many objects, including multiple copies of the same object, per key.

- **`public`** - Any process can read or write to the table.

  [](){: #protected }

- **`protected`** - The owner process can read and write to the table. Other
  processes can only read the table. This is the default setting for the access
  rights.

  [](){: #private }

- **`private`** - Only the owner process can read or write to the table.

- **`named_table`** - If this option is present, the table is registered under
  its `Name` which can then be used instead of the table identifier in
  subsequent operations.

  The function will also return the `Name` instead of the table identifier. To
  get the table identifier of a named table, use `whereis/1`.

- **`{keypos,Pos}`** - Specifies which element in the stored tuples to use as
  key. By default, it is the first element, that is, `Pos=1`. However, this is
  not always appropriate. In particular, we do not want the first element to be
  the key if we want to store Erlang records in a table.

  Notice that any tuple stored in the table must have at least `Pos` number of
  elements.

  [](){: #heir }

- **`{heir,Pid,HeirData} | {heir,none}`** - Set a process as heir. The heir
  inherits the table if the owner terminates. Message
  `{'ETS-TRANSFER',tid(),FromPid,HeirData}` is sent to the heir when that
  occurs. The heir must be a local process. Default heir is `none`, which
  destroys the table when the owner terminates.

  [](){: #new_2_write_concurrency }

- **`{write_concurrency,WriteConcurrencyAlternative}`** - Performance tuning.
  Defaults to `false`, in which case an operation that mutates (writes to) the
  table obtains exclusive access, blocking any concurrent access of the same
  table until finished. If set to `true`, the table is optimized for concurrent
  write access. Different objects of the same table can be mutated (and read) by
  concurrent processes. This is achieved to some degree at the expense of memory
  consumption and the performance of sequential access and concurrent reading.

  The `auto` alternative for the `write_concurrency` option is similar to the
  `true` option but automatically adjusts the synchronization granularity during
  runtime depending on how the table is used. This is the recommended
  `write_concurrency` option when using Erlang/OTP 25 and above as it performs
  well in most scenarios.

  The `write_concurrency` option can be combined with the options
  [`read_concurrency`](`m:ets#new_2_read_concurrency`) and
  [`decentralized_counters`](`m:ets#new_2_decentralized_counters`). You
  typically want to combine `write_concurrency` with `read_concurrency` when
  large concurrent read bursts and large concurrent write bursts are common; for
  more information, see option
  [`read_concurrency`](`m:ets#new_2_read_concurrency`). It is almost always a
  good idea to combine the `write_concurrency` option with the
  [`decentralized_counters`](`m:ets#new_2_decentralized_counters`) option.

  Notice that this option does not change any guarantees about
  [atomicity and isolation](`m:ets#module-concurrency`). Functions that makes such
  promises over many objects (like `insert/2`) gain less (or nothing) from this
  option.

  The memory consumption inflicted by both `write_concurrency` and
  `read_concurrency` is a constant overhead per table for `set`, `bag` and
  `duplicate_bag` when the `true` alternative for the `write_concurrency` option
  is not used. For all tables with the `auto` alternative and `ordered_set`
  tables with `true` alternative the memory overhead depends on the amount of
  actual detected concurrency during runtime. The memory overhead can be
  especially large when both `write_concurrency` and `read_concurrency` are
  combined.

  > #### Note {: .info }
  >
  > Prior to stdlib-3.7 (OTP-22.0) `write_concurrency` had no effect on
  > `ordered_set`.

  > #### Note {: .info }
  >
  > The `auto` alternative for the `write_concurrency` option is only available
  > in OTP-25.0 and above.

  [](){: #new_2_read_concurrency }

- **`{read_concurrency,boolean()}`**(Since OTP R14B)  
  Performance tuning. Defaults to `false`. When set to `true`, the table is
  optimized for concurrent read operations. When this option is enabled read
  operations become much cheaper; especially on systems with multiple physical
  processors. However, switching between read and write operations becomes more
  expensive.

  You typically want to enable this option when concurrent read operations are
  much more frequent than write operations, or when concurrent reads and writes
  comes in large read and write bursts (that is, many reads not interrupted by
  writes, and many writes not interrupted by reads).

  You typically do _not_ want to enable this option when the common access
  pattern is a few read operations interleaved with a few write operations
  repeatedly. In this case, you would get a performance degradation by enabling
  this option.

  Option `read_concurrency` can be combined with option
  [`write_concurrency`](`m:ets#new_2_write_concurrency`). You typically want to
  combine these when large concurrent read bursts and large concurrent write
  bursts are common.

  [](){: #new_2_decentralized_counters }

- **`{decentralized_counters,boolean()}`**(Since OTP 23.0)  
  Performance tuning. Defaults to `true` for all tables with the
  `write_concurrency` option set to `auto`. For tables of type `ordered_set` the
  option also defaults to true when the `write_concurrency` option is set to
  `true`. The option defaults to `false` for all other configurations. This
  option has no effect if the `write_concurrency` option is set to `false`.

  When this option is set to `true`, the table is optimized for frequent
  concurrent calls to operations that modify the tables size and/or its memory
  consumption (e.g., `insert/2` and `delete/2`). The drawback is that calls to
  `info/1` and `info/2` with `size` or `memory` as the second argument can get
  much slower when the `decentralized_counters` option is turned on.

  When this option is enabled the counters for the table size and memory
  consumption are distributed over several cache lines and the scheduling
  threads are mapped to one of those cache lines. The `erl` option
  [`+dcg`](`e:erts:erl_cmd.md#%2Bdcg`) can be used to control the number of
  cache lines that the counters are distributed over.

  [](){: #new_2_compressed }

- **`compressed`**(Since OTP R14B01)  
  If this option is present, the table data is stored in a more compact format
  to consume less memory. However, it will make table operations slower.
  Especially operations that need to inspect entire objects, such as `match` and
  `select`, get much slower. The key element is not compressed.

Fixes a table of type `set`, `bag`, or `duplicate_bag` for
[safe traversal](`m:ets#traversal`) using `first/1` & `next/2`, `match/3` &
`match/1`, `match_object/3` & `match_object/1`, or `select/3` & `select/1`.

A process fixes a table by calling
[`safe_fixtable(Table, true)`](`safe_fixtable/2`). The table remains fixed until
the process releases it by calling
[`safe_fixtable(Table, false)`](`safe_fixtable/2`), or until the process
terminates.

If many processes fix a table, the table remains fixed until all processes have
released it (or terminated). A reference counter is kept on a per process basis,
and N consecutive fixes requires N releases to release the table.

When a table is fixed, a sequence of `first/1` and `next/2` calls are guaranteed
to succeed even if keys are removed during the traversal. The keys for objects
inserted or deleted during a traversal may or may not be returned by
[`next/2`](`next/2`) depending on the ordering of keys within the table and if
the key exists at the time [`next/2`](`next/2`) is called.

_Example:_

```erlang
clean_all_with_value(Table,X) ->
    safe_fixtable(Table,true),
    clean_all_with_value(Table,X,ets:first(Table)),
    safe_fixtable(Table,false).

    end,
    clean_all_with_value(Table,X,ets:next(Table,Key)).
```

Notice that deleted objects are not freed from a fixed table until it has been
released. If a process fixes a table but never releases it, the memory used by
the deleted objects is never freed. The performance of operations on the table
also degrades significantly.

To retrieve information about which processes have fixed which tables, use
[`info(Table, safe_fixed_monotonic_time)`](`m:ets#info_2_safe_fixed_monotonic_time`).
A system with many processes fixing tables can need a monitor that sends alarms
when tables have been fixed for too long.

[match specification](`m:ets#match_spec`). This is a more general call than
`match/2` and `match_object/2` calls. In its simplest form, the match
specification is as follows:

```text
MatchSpec = [MatchFunction]
MatchFunction = {MatchHead, [Guard], [Result]}
MatchHead = "Pattern as in ets:match"
Guard = {"Guardtest name", ...}
Result = "Term construct"
```

This means that the match specification is always a list of one or more tuples
(of arity 3). The first element of the tuple is to be a pattern as described in
`match/2`. The second element of the tuple is to be a list of 0 or more guard
tests (described below). The third element of the tuple is to be a list
containing a description of the value to return. In almost all normal cases, the
list contains exactly one term that fully describes the value to return for each
object.

The return value is constructed using the "match variables" bound in `MatchHead`
or using the special match variables `'$_'` (the whole matching object) and
`'$$'` (all match variables in a list), so that the following
[`match/2`](`match/2`) expression:

```text
ets:match(Table,{'$1','$2','$3'})
```

is exactly equivalent to:

```text
ets:select(Table,[{{'$1','$2','$3'},[],['$$']}])
```

And that the following [`match_object/2`](`match_object/2`) call:

```text
ets:match_object(Table,{'$1','$2','$1'})
```

is exactly equivalent to

```text
ets:select(Table,[{{'$1','$2','$1'},[],['$_']}])
```

Composite terms can be constructed in the `Result` part either by simply writing
a list, so that the following code:

```text
ets:select(Table,[{{'$1','$2','$3'},[],['$$']}])
```

gives the same output as:

```text
ets:select(Table,[{{'$1','$2','$3'},[],[['$1','$2','$3']]}])
```

That is, all the bound variables in the match head as a list. If tuples are to
be constructed, one has to write a tuple of arity 1 where the single element in
the tuple is the tuple one wants to construct (as an ordinary tuple can be
mistaken for a `Guard`).

Therefore the following call:

```text
ets:select(Table,[{{'$1','$2','$1'},[],['$_']}])
```

gives the same output as:

```erlang
ets:select(Table,[{{'$1','$2','$1'},[],[{{'$1','$2','$3'}}]}])
```

This syntax is equivalent to the syntax used in the trace patterns (see the
`m:dbg`) module in Runtime_Tools.

The `Guard`s are constructed as tuples, where the first element is the test name
and the remaining elements are the test parameters. To check for a specific type
(say a list) of the element bound to the match variable `'$1'`, one would write
the test as `{is_list, '$1'}`. If the test fails, the object in the table does
not match and the next `MatchFunction` (if any) is tried. Most guard tests
present in Erlang can be used, but only the new versions prefixed `is_` are
allowed (`is_float`, `is_atom`, and so on).

The `Guard` section can also contain logic and arithmetic operations, which are
written with the same syntax as the guard tests (prefix notation), so that the
following guard test written in Erlang:

```text
is_integer(X), is_integer(Y), X + Y < 4711
```

is expressed as follows (`X` replaced with `'$1'` and `Y` with `'$2'`):

```text
[{is_integer, '$1'}, {is_integer, '$2'}, {'<', {'+', '$1', '$2'}, 4711}]
```

For tables of type `ordered_set`, objects are visited in the same order as in a
`first`/`next` traversal. This means that the match specification is executed
against objects with keys in the `first`/`next` order and the corresponding
result list is in the order of that execution.

Pseudo function that by a `parse_transform` translates `LiteralFun` typed as
parameter in the function call to a [match specification](`m:ets#match_spec`).
With "literal" is meant that the fun must textually be written as the parameter
of the function, it cannot be held in a variable that in turn is passed to the
function.

The parse transform is provided in the `ms_transform` module and the source
_must_ include file `ms_transform.hrl` in STDLIB for this pseudo function to
work. Failing to include the hrl file in the source results in a runtime error,
not a compile time error. The include file is easiest included by adding line
`-include_lib("stdlib/include/ms_transform.hrl").` to the source file.

The fun is very restricted, it can take only a single parameter (the object to
match): a sole variable or a tuple. It must use the `is_` guard tests. Language
constructs that have no representation in a match specification (`if`, `case`,
`receive`, and so on) are not allowed.

The return value is the resulting match specification.

_Example:_

```erlang
1> ets:fun2ms(fun({M,N}) when N > 3 -> M end).
[{{'$1','$2'},[{'>','$2',3}],['$1']}]
```

Variables from the environment can be imported, so that the following works:

```erlang
2> X=3.
3
3> ets:fun2ms(fun({M,N}) when N > X -> M end).
[{{'$1','$2'},[{'>','$2',{const,3}}],['$1']}]
```

The imported variables are replaced by match specification `const` expressions,
which is consistent with the static scoping for Erlang funs. However, local or
global function calls cannot be in the guard or body of the fun. Calls to

Dumps table `Table` to file `Filename`.

When dumping the table, some information about the table is dumped to a header
at the beginning of the dump. This information contains data about the table
type, name, protection, size, version, and if it is a named table. It also
contains notes about what extended information is added to the file, which can
be a count of the objects in the file or a MD5 sum of the header and records in
the file.

The size field in the header might not correspond to the number of records in
the file if the table is public and records are added or removed from the table
during dumping. Public tables updated during dump, and that one wants to verify
when reading, needs at least one field of extended information for the read
verification process to be reliable later.

Option `extended_info` specifies what extra information is written to the table
dump:

- **`object_count`** - The number of objects written to the file is noted in the
  file footer, so file truncation can be verified even if the file was updated
  during dump.

- **`md5sum`** - The header and objects in the file are checksummed using the
  built-in MD5 functions. The MD5 sum of all objects is written in the file
  footer, so that verification while reading detects the slightest bitflip in
  the file data. Using this costs a fair amount of CPU time.

Whenever option `extended_info` is used, it results in a file not readable by
versions of ETS before that in STDLIB 1.15.1

If option `sync` is set to `true`, it ensures that the content of the file is
written to the disk before `tab2file` returns. Defaults to `{sync, false}`.

%% tabfile_info/1 reads the head information in an ets table dumped to
%% disk by means of file2tab and returns a list of the relevant table
%% information
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

-doc """
Returns information about the table dumped to file by `tab2file/2` or
`tab2file/3`.

The following items are returned:

- **`name`** - The name of the dumped table. If the table was a named table, a
  table with the same name cannot exist when the table is loaded from file with
  `file2tab/2`. If the table is not saved as a named table, this field has no
  significance when loading the table from file.

- **`type`** - The ETS type of the dumped table (that is, `set`, `bag`,
  `duplicate_bag`, or `ordered_set`). This type is used when loading the table
  again.

- **`protection`** - The protection of the dumped table (that is, `private`,
  `protected`, or `public`). A table loaded from the file gets the same
  protection.

- **`named_table`** - `true` if the table was a named table when dumped to file,
  otherwise `false`. Notice that when a named table is loaded from a file, there
  cannot exist a table in the system with the same name.

- **`keypos`** - The `keypos` of the table dumped to file, which is used when
  loading the table again.

- **`size`** - The number of objects in the table when the table dump to file
  started. For a `public` table, this number does not need to correspond to the
  number of objects saved to the file, as objects can have been added or deleted
  by another process during table dump.

- **`extended_info`** - The extended information written in the file footer to
  allow stronger verification during table loading from file, as specified to
  `tab2file/3`. Notice that this function only tells _which_ information is
  present, not the values in the file footer. The value is a list containing one
  or more of the atoms `object_count` and `md5sum`.

- **`version`** - A tuple `{Major,Minor}` containing the major and minor version
  of the file format for ETS table dumps. This version field was added beginning
  with STDLIB 1.5.1. Files dumped with older versions return `{0,0}` in this
  field.

An error is returned if the file is inaccessible, badly damaged, or not produced
with `tab2file/2` or `tab2file/3`.

table(Table) ->
    table(Table, []).

-doc """
Returns a Query List Comprehension (QLC) query handle. The `m:qlc` module
provides a query language aimed mainly at Mnesia, but ETS tables, Dets tables,
and lists are also recognized by QLC as sources of data. Calling `table/1,2` is
the means to make the ETS table `Table` usable to QLC.

When there are only simple restrictions on the key position, QLC uses `lookup/2`
to look up the keys. When that is not possible, the whole table is traversed.
Option `traverse` determines how this is done:

- **`first_next`** - The table is traversed one key at a time by calling
  `first/1` and `next/2`.

- **`last_prev`** - The table is traversed one key at a time by calling `last/1`
  and `prev/2`.

- **`select`** - The table is traversed by calling `select/3` and `select/1`.
  Option `n_objects` determines the number of objects returned (the third
  argument of [`select/3`](`select/3`)); the default is to return `100` objects
  at a time. The [match specification](`m:ets#match_spec`) (the second argument
  of [`select/3`](`select/3`)) is assembled by QLC: simple filters are
  translated into equivalent match specifications while more complicated filters
  must be applied to all objects returned by [`select/3`](`select/3`) given a
  match specification that matches all objects.

- **`{select, MatchSpec}`** - As for `select`, the table is traversed by calling
  `select/3` and `select/1`. The difference is that the match specification is
  explicitly specified. This is how to state match specifications that cannot
  easily be expressed within the syntax provided by QLC.

_Examples:_

An explicit match specification is here used to traverse the table:

```erlang
9> true = ets:insert(Table = ets:new(t, []), [{1,a},{2,b},{3,c},{4,d}]),
MS = ets:fun2ms(fun({X,Y}) when (X > 1) or (X < 5) -> {Y} end),
QH1 = ets:table(Table, [{traverse, {select, MS}}]).
```

An example with an implicit match specification:

```erlang
10> QH2 = qlc:q([{Y} || {X,Y} <- ets:table(Table), (X > 1) or (X < 5)]).
```

The latter example is equivalent to the former, which can be verified using
function `qlc:info/1`:

```erlang
11> qlc:info(QH1) =:= qlc:info(QH2).
true
```

`qlc:info/1` returns information about a query handle, and in this case
identical information is returned for the two query handles.
