  Works like [;;4mread_file_info/1,2[0m except that if [;;4mName[0m is a
  symbolic link, information about the link is returned in the [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mfile_info[0m record and the [;;4mtype[0m field of the record is set to [;;4m[0m
  [;;4msymlink[0m.

  If the option [;;4mraw[0m is set, the file server is not called and only
  information about local files is returned. Note that this will
  break this module's atomicity guarantees as it can race with a
  concurrent call to [;;4mwrite_file_info/1,2[0m

  If [;;4mName[0m is not a symbolic link, this function returns the same
  result as [;;4mread_file_info/1[0m. On platforms that do not support
  symbolic links, this function is always equivalent to [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mread_file_info/1[0m.
