  As [;;4mbinary_to_list/1[0m, but returns a list of integers
  corresponding to the bytes from position [;;4mStart[0m to position [;;4mStop[0m
  in [;;4mBinary[0m. The positions in the binary are numbered starting
  from 1.

  Note:
    The one-based indexing for binaries used by this function is
    deprecated. New code is to use [;;4mbinary:bin_to_list/3[0m in
    STDLIB instead. All functions in module [;;4mbinary[0m consistently
    use zero-based indexing.
