  [;1m                 when Dir :: filename(), Reason :: posix().[0m

  Returns [;;4m{ok, Dir}[0m, where [;;4mDir[0m is the current working directory
  of the file server.

  Note:
    In rare circumstances, this function can fail on Unix. It can
    occur if read permission does not exist for the parent
    directories of the current directory.

  A typical error reason:

  [;;4m[;;4meacces[0m[0m:
    Missing read permission for one of the parents of the current
    directory.
