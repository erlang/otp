[;;4mSince[0m:
  OTP 19.0

  Tests a match specification used in calls to [;;4mets:select/2[0m and [;;4m[0m
  [;;4merlang:trace_pattern/3[0m. The function tests both a match
  specification for "syntactic" correctness and runs the match
  specification against the object. If the match specification
  contains errors, the tuple [;;4m{error, Errors}[0m is returned, where [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mErrors[0m is a list of natural language descriptions of what was
  wrong with the match specification.

  If [;;4mType[0m is [;;4mtable[0m, the object to match against is to be a
  tuple. The function then returns [;;4m{ok,Result,[],Warnings}[0m, where [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mResult[0m is what would have been the result in a real [;;4mets:select/2[0m
  call, or [;;4mfalse[0m if the match specification does not match the
  object tuple.

  If [;;4mType[0m is [;;4mtrace[0m, the object to match against is to be a list.
  The function returns [;;4m{ok, Result, Flags, Warnings}[0m, where [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mResult[0m is one of the following:

   â€¢ [;;4mtrue[0m if a trace message is to be emitted

   â€¢ [;;4mfalse[0m if a trace message is not to be emitted

   â€¢ The message term to be appended to the trace message

  [;;4mFlags[0m is a list containing all the trace flags to be enabled,
  currently this is only [;;4mreturn_trace[0m.

  This is a useful debugging and test tool, especially when writing
  complicated match specifications.
