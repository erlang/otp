  Returns [;;4m{ok, Filename}[0m if [;;4mName[0m refers to a symbolic link that
  is not a raw filename, or [;;4m{error, Reason}[0m otherwise. On
  platforms that do not support symbolic links, the return value is [;;4m[0m
  [;;4m{error,enotsup}[0m.

  Typical error reasons:

  [;;4m[;;4meinval[0m[0m:
    [;;4mName[0m does not refer to a symbolic link or the name of the
    file that it refers to does not conform to the expected
    encoding.

  [;;4m[;;4menoent[0m[0m:
    The file does not exist.

  [;;4m[;;4menotsup[0m[0m:
    Symbolic links are not supported on this platform.
