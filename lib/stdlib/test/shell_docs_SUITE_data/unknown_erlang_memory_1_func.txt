  Types:
    -type memory_type() ::
          total | processes | processes_used | system | atom |
          atom_used | binary | code | ets.

  Returns the memory size in bytes allocated for memory of type [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mType[0m. The argument can also be specified as a list of [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mmemory_type()[0m atoms, in which case a corresponding list of [;;4m[0m
  [;;4m{memory_type(), Size :: integer >= 0}[0m tuples is returned.

  Change:
    As from ERTS 5.6.4, [;;4merlang:memory/1[0m requires that all [;;4m[0m
    [;;4merts_alloc(3)[0m allocators are enabled (default behavior).

  Failures:

  [;;4m[;;4mbadarg[0m[0m:
    If [;;4mType[0m is not one of the memory types listed in the
    description of [;;4merlang:memory/0[0m.

  [;;4m[;;4mbadarg[0m[0m:
    If [;;4mmaximum[0m is passed as [;;4mType[0m and the emulator is not run
    in instrumented mode.

  [;;4m[;;4mnotsup[0m[0m:
    If an [;;4merts_alloc(3)[0m allocator has been disabled.
