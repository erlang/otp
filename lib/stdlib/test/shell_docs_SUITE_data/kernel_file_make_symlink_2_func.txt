  Creates a symbolic link [;;4mNew[0m to the file or directory [;;4mExisting[0m
  on platforms supporting symbolic links (most Unix systems and
  Windows, beginning with Vista). [;;4mExisting[0m does not need to exist.
  Returns [;;4mok[0m if the link is successfully created, otherwise [;;4m[0m
  [;;4m{error, Reason}[0m. On platforms not supporting symbolic links, [;;4m[0m
  [;;4m{error, enotsup}[0m is returned.

  Typical error reasons:

   • [;;4meacces[0m - Missing read or write permissions for the parent
     directories of [;;4mExisting[0m or [;;4mNew[0m.

   • [;;4meexist[0m - [;;4mNew[0m already exists.

   • [;;4menotsup[0m - Symbolic links are not supported on this
     platform.

   • [;;4meperm[0m - User does not have privileges to create symbolic
     links ([;;4mSeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege[0m on Windows).
