  Creates a symbolic link [;;4mNew[0m to the file or directory [;;4mExisting[0m
  on platforms supporting symbolic links (most Unix systems and
  Windows, beginning with Vista). [;;4mExisting[0m does not need to exist.
  Returns [;;4mok[0m if the link is successfully created, otherwise [;;4m[0m
  [;;4m{error, Reason}[0m. On platforms not supporting symbolic links, [;;4m[0m
  [;;4m{error, enotsup}[0m is returned.

  Typical error reasons:

  [;;4m[;;4meacces[0m[0m:
    Missing read or write permissions for the parent directories
    of [;;4mExisting[0m or [;;4mNew[0m.

  [;;4m[;;4meexist[0m[0m:
    [;;4mNew[0m already exists.

  [;;4m[;;4menotsup[0m[0m:
    Symbolic links are not supported on this platform.

  [;;4m[;;4meperm[0m[0m:
    User does not have privileges to create symbolic links ([;;4m[0m
    [;;4mSeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege[0m on Windows).
