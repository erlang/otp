  Returns [;;4m{ok, Filename}[0m if [;;4mName[0m refers to a symbolic link or [;;4m[0m
  [;;4m{error, Reason}[0m otherwise. On platforms that do not support
  symbolic links, the return value is [;;4m{error,enotsup}[0m.

  Notice that [;;4mFilename[0m can be either a list or a binary.

  Typical error reasons:

  [;;4m[;;4meinval[0m[0m:
    [;;4mName[0m does not refer to a symbolic link.

  [;;4m[;;4menoent[0m[0m:
    The file does not exist.

  [;;4m[;;4menotsup[0m[0m:
    Symbolic links are not supported on this platform.
