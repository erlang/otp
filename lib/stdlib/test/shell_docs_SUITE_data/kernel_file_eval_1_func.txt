[;1m  eval(Filename)[0m

  Reads and evaluates Erlang expressions, separated by [;;4m.[0m (or [;;4m,[0m,
  a sequence of expressions is also an expression) from [;;4mFilename[0m.
  The result of the evaluation is not returned; any expression
  sequence in the file must be there for its side effect.

  Returns one of the following:

   • [;;4mok[0m - The file was read and evaluated.

   • [;;4m{error, atom()}[0m - An error occurred when opening the file
     or reading it. For a list of typical error codes, see [;;4m[0m
     [;;4mopen/2[0m.

   • [;;4m{error, {Line, Mod, Term}}[0m - An error occurred when
     interpreting the Erlang expressions in the file. To convert
     the three-element tuple to an English description of the
     error, use [;;4mformat_error/1[0m.

  The encoding of [;;4mFilename[0m can be set by a comment, as described
  in [;;4mepp[0m.
