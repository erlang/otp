[;1m  binary_to_term(Binary)[0m

  Returns an Erlang term that is the result of decoding binary
  object [;;4mBinary[0m, which must be encoded according to the Erlang
  external term format.

    > Bin = term_to_binary(hello).
    <<131,100,0,5,104,101,108,108,111>>
    > hello = binary_to_term(Bin).
    hello

  [;;4mWarning[0m

    When decoding binaries from untrusted sources, the untrusted
    source may submit data in a way to create resources, such as
    atoms and remote references, that cannot be garbage collected
    and lead to Denial of Service attack. In such cases, consider
    using [;;4mbinary_to_term/2[0m with the [;;4msafe[0m option.

  See also [;;4mterm_to_binary/1[0m and [;;4mbinary_to_term/2[0m.

[;1m  binary_to_term(Binary, Opts)[0m

[;;4mSince[0m:
  OTP R13B04

  Equivalent to [;;4mbinary_to_term(Binary)[0m, but can be configured to
  fit special purposes.

  The allowed options are:

   • [;;4msafe[0m - Use this option when receiving binaries from an
     untrusted source.

     When enabled, it prevents decoding data that can be used to
     attack the Erlang runtime. In the event of receiving unsafe
     data, decoding fails with a [;;4mbadarg[0m error.

     This prevents creation of new atoms directly, creation of
     new atoms indirectly (as they are embedded in certain
     structures, such as process identifiers, refs, and funs),
     and creation of new external function references. None of
     those resources are garbage collected, so unchecked creation
     of them can exhaust available memory.

       > binary_to_term(<<131,100,0,5,"hello">>, [safe]).
       ** exception error: bad argument
       > hello.
       hello
       > binary_to_term(<<131,100,0,5,"hello">>, [safe]).
       hello

  [;;4mWarning[0m

       The [;;4msafe[0m option ensures the data is safely processed
       by the Erlang runtime but it does not guarantee the data
       is safe to your application. You must always validate
       data from untrusted sources. If the binary is stored or
       transits through untrusted sources, you should also
       consider cryptographically signing it.

   • [;;4mused[0m - Changes the return value to [;;4m{Term, Used}[0m where [;;4m[0m
     [;;4mUsed[0m is the number of bytes actually read from [;;4mBinary[0m.

       > Input = <<131,100,0,5,"hello","world">>.
       <<131,100,0,5,104,101,108,108,111,119,111,114,108,100>>
       > {Term, Used} = binary_to_term(Input, [used]).
       {hello, 9}
       > split_binary(Input, Used).
       {<<131,100,0,5,104,101,108,108,111>>, <<"world">>}

  Failure: [;;4mbadarg[0m if [;;4msafe[0m is specified and unsafe data is
  decoded.
