  Request notification when more data is available to fetch using [;;4m[0m
  [;;4merlang:dist_ctrl_get_data(DHandle)[0m for the distribution channel
  identified by [;;4mDHandle[0m. When more data is present, the caller
  will be sent the message [;;4mdist_data[0m. Once a [;;4mdist_data[0m messages
  has been sent, no more [;;4mdist_data[0m messages will be sent until the [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mdist_ctrl_get_data_notification/1[0m function has been called again.

  Note:
    Only the process registered as distribution controller for the
    distribution channel identified by [;;4mDHandle[0m is allowed to
    call this function.

  This function is used when implementing an alternative
  distribution carrier using processes as distribution controllers. [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mDHandle[0m is retrieved via the callback [;;4mf_handshake_complete[0m.
  More information can be found in the documentation of ERTS User's
  Guide âžœ How to implement an Alternative Carrier for the Erlang
  Distribution âžœ Distribution Module.
