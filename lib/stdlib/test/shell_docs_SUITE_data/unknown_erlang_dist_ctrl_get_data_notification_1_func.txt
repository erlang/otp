    Only the process registered as distribution controller for the
    distribution channel identified by [;;4mDHandle[0m is allowed to
    call this function.

  This function is used when implementing an alternative

  [;;4mDHandle[0m is retrieved via the callback [;;4mf_handshake_complete[0m.
