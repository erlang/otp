[;1m  now()[0m

[;;4mDeprecated[0m:
  erlang:now/0 is deprecated; see the "Time and Time Correction in
  Erlang" chapter of the ERTS User's Guide for more information

  [;;4mWarning[0m

    This function is deprecated. Do not use it. For more
    information, see section Time and Time Correction in the
    User's Guide. Specifically, section Dos and Dont's describes
    what to use instead of [;;4merlang:now/0[0m.

  Returns the tuple [;;4m{MegaSecs, Secs, MicroSecs}[0m, which is the
  elapsed time since 00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970 (zero hour), if
  provided by the underlying OS. Otherwise some other point in time
  is chosen. It is also guaranteed that the following calls to this
  BIF return continuously increasing values. Hence, the return value
  from [;;4merlang:now/0[0m can be used to generate unique time stamps. If
  it is called in a tight loop on a fast machine, the time of the
  node can become skewed.

  Can only be used to check the local time of day if the time-zone
  information of the underlying OS is properly configured.
