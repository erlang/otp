  [;1m-spec is_record(Term, RecordTag) -> boolean()[0m
  [;1m                   when Term :: term(), RecordTag :: atom().[0m

  Returns [;;4mtrue[0m if [;;4mTerm[0m is a tuple and its first element is [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mRecordTag[0m. Otherwise returns [;;4mfalse[0m.

  Note:
    Normally the compiler treats calls to [;;4mis_record/2[0m
    especially. It emits code to verify that [;;4mTerm[0m is a tuple,
    that its first element is [;;4mRecordTag[0m, and that the size is
    correct. However, if [;;4mRecordTag[0m is not a literal atom, the
    BIF [;;4mis_record/2[0m is called instead and the size of the tuple
    is not verified.

  Allowed in guard tests, if [;;4mRecordTag[0m is a literal atom.
