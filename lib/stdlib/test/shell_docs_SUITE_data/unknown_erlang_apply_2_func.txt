[;1m  apply(Fun, Args)[0m

  Calls a fun, passing the elements in [;;4mArgs[0m as arguments.

  If the number of elements in the arguments are known at compile
  time, the call is better written as [;;4mFun(Arg1, Arg2, ... ArgN)[0m.

  [;;4mWarning[0m

    Earlier, [;;4mFun[0m could also be specified as [;;4m{Module, Function}[0m,
    equivalent to [;;4mapply(Module, Function, Args)[0m. This use is
    deprecated and will stop working in a future release.
