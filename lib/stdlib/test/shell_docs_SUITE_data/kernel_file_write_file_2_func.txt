  Writes the contents of the [;;4miodata[0m term [;;4mBytes[0m to file [;;4mFilename[0m.
  The file is created if it does not exist. If it exists, the
  previous contents are overwritten. Returns [;;4mok[0m if successful,
  otherwise [;;4m{error, Reason}[0m.

  Typical error reasons:

  [;;4m[;;4menoent[0m[0m:
    A component of the filename does not exist.

  [;;4m[;;4menotdir[0m[0m:
    A component of the filename is not a directory. On some
    platforms, [;;4menoent[0m is returned instead.

  [;;4m[;;4menospc[0m[0m:
    No space is left on the device.

  [;;4m[;;4meacces[0m[0m:
    Missing permission for writing the file or searching one of
    the parent directories.

  [;;4m[;;4meisdir[0m[0m:
    The named file is a directory.
