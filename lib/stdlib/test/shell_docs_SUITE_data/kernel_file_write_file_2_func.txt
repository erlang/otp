  Writes the contents of the [;;4miodata[0m term [;;4mBytes[0m to file [;;4mFilename[0m.
  The file is created if it does not exist. If it exists, the
  previous contents are overwritten. Returns [;;4mok[0m if successful,
  otherwise [;;4m{error, Reason}[0m.

  Typical error reasons:

   • [;;4menoent[0m - A component of the filename does not exist.

   • [;;4menotdir[0m - A component of the filename is not a directory.

   • [;;4menospc[0m - No space is left on the device.

   • [;;4meacces[0m - Missing permission for writing the file or
     searching one of the parent directories.
