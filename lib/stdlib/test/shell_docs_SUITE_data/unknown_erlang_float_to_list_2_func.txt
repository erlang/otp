[;;4mSince[0m:
  OTP R16B

  Returns a string corresponding to the text representation of [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mFloat[0m using fixed decimal point formatting.

  Available options:

   • If option [;;4mdecimals[0m is specified, the returned value
     contains at most [;;4mDecimals[0m number of digits past the
     decimal point. If the number does not fit in the internal
     static buffer of 256 bytes, the function throws [;;4mbadarg[0m.

   • If option [;;4mcompact[0m is specified, the trailing zeros at the
     end of the list are truncated. This option is only
     meaningful together with option [;;4mdecimals[0m.

   • If option [;;4mscientific[0m is specified, the float is formatted
     using scientific notation with [;;4mDecimals[0m digits of
     precision.

   • If option [;;4mshort[0m is specified, the float is formatted with
     the smallest number of digits that still guarantees that [;;4mF[0m
     [;;4m=:= list_to_float(float_to_list(F, [short]))[0m. When the
     float is inside the range (-2⁵³, 2⁵³), the notation that
     yields the smallest number of characters is used (scientific
     notation or normal decimal notation). Floats outside the
     range (-2⁵³, 2⁵³) are always formatted using scientific
     notation to avoid confusing results when doing arithmetic
     operations.

   • If [;;4mOptions[0m is [;;4m[][0m, the function behaves as [;;4m[0m
     [;;4mfloat_to_list/1[0m.

  Examples:

    > float_to_list(7.12, [{decimals, 4}]).
    "7.1200"
    > float_to_list(7.12, [{decimals, 4}, compact]).
    "7.12"
    > float_to_list(7.12, [{scientific, 3}]).
    "7.120e+00"
    > float_to_list(7.12, [short]).
    "7.12"
    > float_to_list(0.1+0.2, [short]).
    "0.30000000000000004"
    > float_to_list(0.1+0.2)
    "3.00000000000000044409e-01"

  In the last example, [;;4mfloat_to_list(0.1+0.2)[0m evaluates to [;;4m[0m
  [;;4m"3.00000000000000044409e-01"[0m. The reason for this is explained in 
  Representation of Floating Point Numbers.
