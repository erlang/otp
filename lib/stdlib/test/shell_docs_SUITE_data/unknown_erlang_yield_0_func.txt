[;1m  yield()[0m

  Tries to give other processes with the same or higher priority (if
  any) a chance to execute before returning. There is no guarantee
  that any other process runs between the invocation and return of [;;4m[0m
  [;;4merlang:yield/0[0m.

  See the documentation for [;;4mreceive-after[0m expressions for how to
  make the current process sleep for a specific number of
  milliseconds.

  [;;4mWarning[0m

    There is seldom or never any need to use this BIF. Using this
    BIF without a thorough grasp of how the scheduler works can
    cause performance degradation. The current implementation of
    this function puts the current process last in the current
    scheduler's queue for processes of the same priority as the
    current process.
