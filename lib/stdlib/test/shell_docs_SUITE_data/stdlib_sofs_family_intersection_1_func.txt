  If [;;4mFamily1[0m is a family and [;;4mFamily1[0m[i] is a set of sets for
  every i in the index set of [;;4mFamily1[0m, then [;;4mFamily2[0m is the
  family with the same index set as [;;4mFamily1[0m such that [;;4mFamily2[0m[i]
  is the intersection of [;;4mFamily1[0m[i].

  If [;;4mFamily1[0m[i] is an empty set for some i, the process exits with
  a [;;4mbadarg[0m message.
