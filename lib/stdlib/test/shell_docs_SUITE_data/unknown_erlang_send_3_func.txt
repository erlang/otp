  Either sends a message and returns [;;4mok[0m, or does not send the
  message but returns something else (see below). Otherwise the same
  as [;;4merlang:send/2[0m. For more detailed explanation and warnings,
  see [;;4merlang:send_nosuspend/2,3[0m.

  Options:

  [;;4m[;;4mnosuspend[0m[0m:
    If the sender would have to be suspended to do the send, [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mnosuspend[0m is returned instead.

  [;;4m[;;4mnoconnect[0m[0m:
    If the destination node would have to be auto-connected to do
    the send, [;;4mnoconnect[0m is returned instead.

  Note:
    For some important information about distributed signals, see
    the Blocking Signaling Over Distribution section in the 
    Processes chapter of the Erlang Reference Manual.

  Warning:
    As with [;;4merlang:send_nosuspend/2,3[0m: use with extreme care.
