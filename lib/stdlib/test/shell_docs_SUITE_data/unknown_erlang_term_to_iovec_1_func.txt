  [;1m-spec term_to_iovec(Term) -> ext_iovec() when Term :: term().[0m

[;;4mSince[0m:
  OTP 23.0

  Returns the encoding of [;;4mTerm[0m according to the Erlang external
  term format as [;;4mext_iovec()[0m.

  This function produce the same encoding as [;;4mterm_to_binary/1[0m, but
  with another return type. The call [;;4m[0m
  [;;4miolist_to_binary(term_to_iovec(Term))[0m will produce exactly the
  same result as the call [;;4mterm_to_binary(Term)[0m.

  [;;4mterm_to_iovec()[0m is a pure optimization of the functionality [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mterm_to_binary()[0m provide. [;;4mterm_to_iovec()[0m can for example refer
  directly to off heap binaries instead of copying the binary data
  into the result.

  See also [;;4mterm_to_binary/1[0m.
