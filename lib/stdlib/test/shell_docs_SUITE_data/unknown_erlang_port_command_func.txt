  [;1m                      when Port :: port() | atom(), Data :: iodata().[0m

  Sends data to a port. Same as [;;4mPort ! {PortOwner, {command, Data}}[0m
  except for the error behavior and being synchronous (see below).
  Any process can send data to a port with [;;4mport_command/2[0m, not
  only the port owner (the connected process).

  For comparison: [;;4mPort ! {PortOwner, {command, Data}}[0m only fails
  with [;;4mbadarg[0m if [;;4mPort[0m does not refer to a port or a process. If [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mPort[0m is a closed port, the data message disappears without a
  sound. If [;;4mPort[0m is open and the calling process is not the port
  owner, the port owner fails with [;;4mbadsig[0m. The port owner fails
  with [;;4mbadsig[0m also if [;;4mData[0m is an invalid I/O list.

  Notice that any process can send to a port using [;;4mPort ![0m
  [;;4m{PortOwner, {command, Data}}[0m as if it itself was the port owner.

  If the port is busy, the calling process is suspended until the
  port is not busy any more.

  As from Erlang/OTP R16, [;;4mPort ! {PortOwner, {command, Data}}[0m is
  truly asynchronous. Notice that this operation has always been
  documented as an asynchronous operation, while the underlying
  implementation has been synchronous. [;;4mport_command/2[0m is however
  still fully synchronous because of its error behavior.

  Failures:

  [;;4m[;;4mbadarg[0m[0m:
    If [;;4mPort[0m is not an identifier of an open port, or the
    registered name of an open port. If the calling process was
    previously linked to the closed port, identified by [;;4mPort[0m,
    the exit signal from the port is guaranteed to be delivered
    before this [;;4mbadarg[0m exception occurs.

  [;;4m[;;4mbadarg[0m[0m:
    If [;;4mData[0m is an invalid I/O list.

  Warning:
    Do not send data to an unknown port. Any undefined behavior is
    possible (including node crash) depending on how the port
    driver interprets the data.

  Sends data to a port. [;;4mport_command(Port, Data, [])[0m equals [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mport_command(Port, Data)[0m.

  If the port command is aborted, [;;4mfalse[0m is returned, otherwise [;;4m[0m

  port is not busy anymore.

  [;;4m[;;4mforce[0m[0m:
    The calling process is not suspended if the port is busy,
    instead the port command is forced through. The call fails
    with a [;;4mnotsup[0m exception if the driver of the port does not
    support this. For more information, see driver flag [;;4m[0m

  [;;4m[;;4mnosuspend[0m[0m:
    The calling process is not suspended if the port is busy,
    instead the port command is aborted and [;;4mfalse[0m is returned.

    More options can be added in a future release.
