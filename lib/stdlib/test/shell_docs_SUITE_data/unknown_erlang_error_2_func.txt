  [;1m-spec error(Reason, Args) -> no_return()[0m
  [;1m               when Reason :: term(), Args :: [term()] | none.[0m

  Raises an exception of class [;;4merror[0m with the reason [;;4mReason[0m. [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mArgs[0m is expected to be the list of arguments for the current
  function or the atom [;;4mnone[0m. If it is a list, it is used to
  provide the arguments for the current function in the stack
  back-trace. If it is [;;4mnone[0m, the arity of the calling function is
  used in the stacktrace. As evaluating this function causes an
  exception to be raised, it has no return value.

  The intent of the exception class [;;4merror[0m is to signal that an
  unexpected error has happened (for example, a function is called
  with a parameter that has an incorrect type). See the guide about 
  errors and error handling for additional information. Example:

  [;;4mtest.erl[0m:

    -module(test).
    -export([example_fun/2]).
    
    example_fun(A1, A2) ->
        erlang:error(my_error, [A1, A2]).

  Erlang shell:

    6> c(test).
    {ok,test}
    7> test:example_fun(arg1,"this is the second argument").
    ** exception error: my_error
         in function  test:example_fun/2
             called as test:example_fun(arg1,"this is the second argument")
