  [;1m-spec erlang:monotonic_time() -> integer().[0m

[;;4mSince[0m:
  OTP 18.0

  Returns the current Erlang monotonic time in [;;4mnative[0m time unit.
  This is a monotonically increasing time since some unspecified
  point in time.

  Note:
    This is a monotonically increasing time, but not a 
    strictly monotonically increasing time. That is, consecutive
    calls to [;;4merlang:monotonic_time/0[0m can produce the same
    result.

    Different runtime system instances will use different
    unspecified points in time as base for their Erlang monotonic
    clocks. That is, it is pointless comparing monotonic times
    from different runtime system instances. Different runtime
    system instances can also place this unspecified point in time
    different relative runtime system start. It can be placed in
    the future (time at start is a negative value), the past (time
    at start is a positive value), or the runtime system start
    (time at start is zero). The monotonic time at runtime system
    start can be retrieved by calling [;;4m[0m
    [;;4merlang:system_info(start_time)[0m.
