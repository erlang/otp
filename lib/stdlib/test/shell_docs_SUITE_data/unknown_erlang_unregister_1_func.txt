  [;1m-spec unregister(RegName) -> true when RegName :: atom().[0m

  Removes the [;;4mregistered name[0m [;;4mRegName[0m associated with a process
  identifier or a port identifier from the [;;4mname registry[0m. For
  example:

    > unregister(db).
    true

  Keep in mind that you can still receive signals associated with
  the registered name after it has been unregistered as the sender
  may have looked up the name before sending to it.

  Users are advised not to unregister system processes.
