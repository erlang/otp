  Changes file information. Returns [;;4mok[0m if successful, otherwise [;;4m[0m
  [;;4m{error, Reason}[0m. [;;4mFileInfo[0m is a record [;;4mfile_info[0m, defined in
  the Kernel include file [;;4mfile.hrl[0m. Include the following
  directive in the module from which the function is called:

     -include_lib("kernel/include/file.hrl").

  The time type set in [;;4matime[0m, [;;4mmtime[0m, and [;;4mctime[0m depends on the
  time type set in [;;4mOpts :: {time, Type}[0m as follows:

  [;;4m[;;4mlocal[0m[0m:
    Interprets the time set as local.

  [;;4m[;;4muniversal[0m[0m:
    Interprets it as universal time.

  [;;4m[;;4mposix[0m[0m:
    Must be seconds since or before Unix time epoch, which is
    1970-01-01 00:00 UTC.

  Default is [;;4m{time, local}[0m.

  If the option [;;4mraw[0m is set, the file server is not called and only
  information about local files is returned.

  The following fields are used from the record, if they are
  specified:

  [;;4m[;;4matime = [0m[;;4mdate_time()[0m[;;4m | integer() >= 0[0m[0m:
    The last time the file was read.

  [;;4m[;;4mmtime = [0m[;;4mdate_time()[0m[;;4m | integer() >= 0[0m[0m:
    The last time the file was written.

  [;;4m[;;4mctime = [0m[;;4mdate_time()[0m[;;4m | integer() >= 0[0m[0m:
    On Unix, any value specified for this field is ignored (the
    "ctime" for the file is set to the current time). On Windows,
    this field is the new creation time to set for the file.

  [;;4m[;;4mmode = integer() >= 0[0m[0m:
    The file permissions as the sum of the following bit values:

    On Unix platforms, other bits than those listed above may be
    set.

  [;;4m[;;4muid = integer() >= 0[0m[0m:
    Indicates the file owner. Ignored for non-Unix file systems.

  [;;4m[;;4mgid = integer() >= 0[0m[0m:
    Gives the group that the file owner belongs to. Ignored for
    non-Unix file systems.

  Typical error reasons:

  [;;4m[;;4meacces[0m[0m:
    Missing search permission for one of the parent directories of
    the file.

  [;;4m[;;4menoent[0m[0m:

  [;;4m[;;4menotdir[0m[0m:
    A component of the filename is not a directory. On some
    platforms, [;;4menoent[0m is returned instead.
