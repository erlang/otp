  [])

[;1m  write_file_info(Filename, FileInfo, Opts)[0m

[;;4mSince[0m:
  OTP R15B

  Changes file information. Returns [;;4mok[0m if successful, otherwise [;;4m[0m
  [;;4m{error, Reason}[0m.

  [;;4mFileInfo[0m is a record [;;4mfile_info[0m, defined in the Kernel include
  file [;;4mfile.hrl[0m. Include the following directive in the module
  from which the function is called:

    -include_lib("kernel/include/file.hrl").

  The time type set in [;;4matime[0m, [;;4mmtime[0m, and [;;4mctime[0m depends on the
  time type set in [;;4mOpts :: {time, Type}[0m as follows:

   • [;;4mlocal[0m - Interprets the time set as local.

   • [;;4muniversal[0m - Interprets it as universal time.

   • [;;4mposix[0m - Must be seconds since or before Unix time epoch,
     which is 1970-01-01 00:00 UTC.

  Default is [;;4m{time, local}[0m.

  If the option [;;4mraw[0m is set, the file server is not called and only
  information about local files is returned.

  The following fields are used from the record, if they are
  specified:

   • [;;4matime = [0m[;;4mdate_time/0[0m [;;4m| [0m[;;4mnon_neg_integer/0[0m - The last time
     the file was read.

   • [;;4mmtime = [0m[;;4mdate_time/0[0m [;;4m| [0m[;;4mnon_neg_integer/0[0m - The last time
     the file was written.

   • [;;4mctime = [0m[;;4mdate_time/0[0m [;;4m| [0m[;;4mnon_neg_integer/0[0m - On Unix, any
     value specified for this field is ignored (the "ctime" for
     the file is set to the current time). On Windows, this field
     is the new creation time to set for the file.

   • [;;4mmode = [0m[;;4mnon_neg_integer/0[0m - The file permissions as the sum
     of the following bit values:

      ￮ [;;4m8#00400[0m - Read permission: owner

      ￮ [;;4m8#00200[0m - Write permission: owner

      ￮ [;;4m8#00100[0m - Execute permission: owner

      ￮ [;;4m8#00040[0m - Read permission: group

      ￮ [;;4m8#00020[0m - Write permission: group

      ￮ [;;4m8#00010[0m - Execute permission: group

      ￮ [;;4m8#00004[0m - Read permission: other

      ￮ [;;4m8#00002[0m - Write permission: other

      ￮ [;;4m8#00001[0m - Execute permission: other

      ￮ [;;4m16#800[0m - Set user id on execution

      ￮ [;;4m16#400[0m - Set group id on execution

     On Unix platforms, other bits than those listed above may be
     set.

   • [;;4muid = [0m[;;4mnon_neg_integer/0[0m - Indicates the file owner.
     Ignored for non-Unix file systems.

   • [;;4mgid = [0m[;;4mnon_neg_integer/0[0m - Gives the group that the file
     owner belongs to. Ignored for non-Unix file systems.

  Typical error reasons:

   • [;;4meacces[0m - Missing search permission for one of the parent
     directories of the file.

   • [;;4menoent[0m - The file does not exist.

   • [;;4menotdir[0m - A component of the filename is not a directory.
     On some platforms, [;;4menoent[0m is returned instead.
