  Retrieves information about a file. Returns [;;4m{ok, FileInfo}[0m if
  successful, otherwise [;;4m{error, Reason}[0m. [;;4mFileInfo[0m is a record [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mfile_info[0m, defined in the Kernel include file [;;4mfile.hrl[0m. Include
  the following directive in the module from which the function is
  called:

     -include_lib("kernel/include/file.hrl").

  The time type returned in [;;4matime[0m, [;;4mmtime[0m, and [;;4mctime[0m is
  dependent on the time type set in [;;4mOpts :: {time, Type}[0m as
  follows:

  [;;4m[;;4mlocal[0m[0m:
    Returns local time.

  [;;4m[;;4muniversal[0m[0m:
    Returns universal time.

  [;;4m[;;4mposix[0m[0m:
    Returns seconds since or before Unix time epoch, which is
    1970-01-01 00:00 UTC.

  Default is [;;4m{time, local}[0m.

  If the option [;;4mraw[0m is set, the file server is not called and only
  information about local files is returned. Note that this will
  break this module's atomicity guarantees as it can race with a
  concurrent call to [;;4mwrite_file_info/1,2[0m .

  This option has no effect when the function is given an I/O device
  instead of a file name. Use [;;4mopen/2[0m with the [;;4mraw[0m mode to obtain
  a file descriptor first.

  Note:
    As file times are stored in POSIX time on most OS, it is
    faster to query file information with option [;;4mposix[0m.

  The record [;;4mfile_info[0m contains the following fields:

  [;;4m[;;4msize = integer() >= 0[0m[0m:
    Size of file in bytes.

  [;;4m[;;4mtype = device | directory | other | regular[0m[0m:
    The type of the file. Can also contain [;;4msymlink[0m when returned
    from read_link_info/1,2.

  [;;4m[;;4maccess = read | write | read_write | none[0m[0m:
    The current system access to the file.

  [;;4m[;;4matime = [0m[;;4mdate_time()[0m[;;4m | integer() >= 0[0m[0m:
    The last time the file was read.

  [;;4m[;;4mmtime = [0m[;;4mdate_time()[0m[;;4m | integer() >= 0[0m[0m:
    The last time the file was written.

  [;;4m[;;4mctime = [0m[;;4mdate_time()[0m[;;4m | integer() >=0[0m[0m:
    The interpretation of this time field depends on the operating
    system. On Unix, it is the last time the file or the [;;4minode[0m
    was changed. In Windows, it is the create time.

  [;;4m[;;4mmode = integer() >= 0[0m[0m:
    The file permissions as the sum of the following bit values:

    [;;4m[;;4m8#00400[0m[0m:
      read permission: owner

    [;;4m[;;4m8#00200[0m[0m:
      write permission: owner

    [;;4m[;;4m8#00100[0m[0m:
      execute permission: owner

    [;;4m[;;4m8#00040[0m[0m:
      read permission: group

    [;;4m[;;4m8#00020[0m[0m:
      write permission: group

    [;;4m[;;4m8#00010[0m[0m:
      execute permission: group

    [;;4m[;;4m8#00004[0m[0m:
      read permission: other

    [;;4m[;;4m8#00002[0m[0m:
      write permission: other

    [;;4m[;;4m8#00001[0m[0m:
      execute permission: other

    [;;4m[;;4m16#800[0m[0m:
      set user id on execution

    [;;4m[;;4m16#400[0m[0m:
      set group id on execution

    On Unix platforms, other bits than those listed above may be
    set.

  [;;4m[;;4mlinks = integer() >= 0[0m[0m:
    Number of links to the file (this is always 1 for file systems
    that have no concept of links).

  [;;4m[;;4mmajor_device = integer() >= 0[0m[0m:
    Identifies the file system where the file is located. In
    Windows, the number indicates a drive as follows: 0 means A:,
    1 means B:, and so on.

  [;;4m[;;4mminor_device = integer() >= 0[0m[0m:
    Only valid for character devices on Unix. In all other cases,
    this field is zero.

  [;;4m[;;4minode = integer() >= 0[0m[0m:
    Gives the [;;4minode[0m number. On non-Unix file systems, this field
    is zero.

  [;;4m[;;4muid = integer() >= 0[0m[0m:
    Indicates the owner of the file. On non-Unix file systems,
    this field is zero.

  [;;4m[;;4mgid = integer() >= 0[0m[0m:
    Gives the group that the owner of the file belongs to. On
    non-Unix file systems, this field is zero.

  Typical error reasons:

  [;;4m[;;4meacces[0m[0m:
    Missing search permission for one of the parent directories of
    the file.

  [;;4m[;;4menoent[0m[0m:
    The file does not exist.

  [;;4m[;;4menotdir[0m[0m:
    A component of the filename is not a directory. On some
    platforms, [;;4menoent[0m is returned instead.
