  Returns a list with information about memory dynamically allocated
  by the Erlang emulator. Each list element is a tuple [;;4m{Type, Size}[0m.
  The first element [;;4mType[0m is an atom describing memory type. The
  second element [;;4mSize[0m is the memory size in bytes.

  Memory types:

  [;;4m[;;4mtotal[0m[0m:
    The total amount of memory currently allocated. This is the
    same as the sum of the memory size for [;;4mprocesses[0m and [;;4msystem[0m.

  [;;4m[;;4mprocesses[0m[0m:
    The total amount of memory currently allocated for the Erlang
    processes.

  [;;4m[;;4mprocesses_used[0m[0m:
    The total amount of memory currently used by the Erlang
    processes. This is part of the memory presented as [;;4mprocesses[0m
    memory.

  [;;4m[;;4msystem[0m[0m:
    The total amount of memory currently allocated for the
    emulator that is not directly related to any Erlang process.
    Memory presented as [;;4mprocesses[0m is not included in this
    memory. [;;4minstrument(3)[0m can be used to get a more detailed
    breakdown of what memory is part of this type.

  [;;4m[;;4matom[0m[0m:
    The total amount of memory currently allocated for atoms. This
    memory is part of the memory presented as [;;4msystem[0m memory.

  [;;4m[;;4matom_used[0m[0m:
    The total amount of memory currently used for atoms. This
    memory is part of the memory presented as [;;4matom[0m memory.

  [;;4m[;;4mbinary[0m[0m:
    The total amount of memory currently allocated for binaries.
    This memory is part of the memory presented as [;;4msystem[0m
    memory.

  [;;4m[;;4mcode[0m[0m:
    The total amount of memory currently allocated for Erlang
    code. This memory is part of the memory presented as [;;4msystem[0m
    memory.

  [;;4m[;;4mets[0m[0m:
    The total amount of memory currently allocated for ETS tables.
    This memory is part of the memory presented as [;;4msystem[0m
    memory.

  [;;4m[;;4mmaximum[0m[0m:
    The maximum total amount of memory allocated since the
    emulator was started. This tuple is only present when the
    emulator is run with instrumentation.

    For information on how to run the emulator with
    instrumentation, see [;;4minstrument(3)[0m and/or [;;4merl(1)[0m.

  Note:
    The [;;4msystem[0m value is not complete. Some allocated memory that
    is to be part of this value is not.

    When the emulator is run with instrumentation, the [;;4msystem[0m
    value is more accurate, but memory directly allocated for [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mmalloc[0m (and friends) is still not part of the [;;4msystem[0m value.
    Direct calls to [;;4mmalloc[0m are only done from OS-specific
    runtime libraries and perhaps from user-implemented Erlang
    drivers that do not use the memory allocation functions in the
    driver interface.

    As the [;;4mtotal[0m value is the sum of [;;4mprocesses[0m and [;;4msystem[0m,
    the error in [;;4msystem[0m propagates to the [;;4mtotal[0m value.

    The different amounts of memory that are summed are not
    gathered atomically, which introduces an error in the result.

  The different values have the following relation to each other.
  Values beginning with an uppercase letter is not part of the
  result.

    total      = processes + system
    processes  = processes_used + ProcessesNotUsed
    system     = atom + binary + code + ets + OtherSystem
    atom       = atom_used + AtomNotUsed
    RealTotal  = processes + RealSystem
    RealSystem = system + MissedSystem

  More tuples in the returned list can be added in a future release.

  Note:
    The [;;4mtotal[0m value is supposed to be the total amount of memory
    dynamically allocated by the emulator. Shared libraries, the
    code of the emulator itself, and the emulator stacks are not
    supposed to be included. That is, the [;;4mtotal[0m value is not
    supposed to be equal to the total size of all pages mapped to
    the emulator.

    Also, because of fragmentation and prereservation of memory
    areas, the size of the memory segments containing the
    dynamically allocated memory blocks can be much larger than
    the total size of the dynamically allocated memory blocks.

  Change:
    As from ERTS 5.6.4, [;;4merlang:memory/0[0m requires that all [;;4m[0m
    [;;4merts_alloc(3)[0m allocators are enabled (default behavior).

  Failure: [;;4mnotsup[0m if an [;;4merts_alloc(3)[0m allocator has been
  disabled.

  [;;4mType[0m. The argument can also be specified as a list of [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mmemory_type()[0m atoms, in which case a corresponding list of [;;4m[0m
  [;;4m{memory_type(), Size :: integer >= 0}[0m tuples is returned.
