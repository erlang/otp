  Sends data to a port. [;;4mport_command(Port, Data, [])[0m equals [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mport_command(Port, Data)[0m.

  If the port command is aborted, [;;4mfalse[0m is returned, otherwise [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mtrue[0m.

  If the port is busy, the calling process is suspended until the
  port is not busy anymore.

  [;;4mOption[0ms:

  [;;4m[;;4mforce[0m[0m:
    The calling process is not suspended if the port is busy,
    instead the port command is forced through. The call fails
    with a [;;4mnotsup[0m exception if the driver of the port does not
    support this. For more information, see driver flag [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mERL_DRV_FLAG_SOFT_BUSY[0m.

  [;;4m[;;4mnosuspend[0m[0m:
    The calling process is not suspended if the port is busy,
    instead the port command is aborted and [;;4mfalse[0m is returned.

  Change:
    More options can be added in a future release.

  Failures:

  [;;4m[;;4mbadarg[0m[0m:
    If [;;4mPort[0m is not an identifier of an open port, or the
    registered name of an open port. If the calling process was
    previously linked to the closed port, identified by [;;4mPort[0m,
    the exit signal from the port is guaranteed to be delivered
    before this [;;4mbadarg[0m exception occurs.

  [;;4m[;;4mbadarg[0m[0m:
    If [;;4mData[0m is an invalid I/O list.

  [;;4m[;;4mbadarg[0m[0m:
    If [;;4mOptionList[0m is an invalid option list.

  [;;4m[;;4mnotsup[0m[0m:
    If option [;;4mforce[0m has been passed, but the driver of the port
    does not allow forcing through a busy port.

  Warning:
    Do not send data to an unknown port. Any undefined behavior is
    possible (including node crash) depending on how the port
    driver interprets the data.
