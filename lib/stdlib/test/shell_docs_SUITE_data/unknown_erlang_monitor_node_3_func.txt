  Behaves as [;;4mmonitor_node/2[0m except that it allows an extra option
  to be specified, namely [;;4mallow_passive_connect[0m. This option
  allows the BIF to wait the normal network connection time-out for
  the monitored node to connect itself, even if it cannot be
  actively connected from this node (that is, it is blocked). The
  state where this can be useful can only be achieved by using the
  Kernel option [;;4mdist_auto_connect once[0m. If that option is not
  used, option [;;4mallow_passive_connect[0m has no effect.

  Note:
    Option [;;4mallow_passive_connect[0m is used internally and is
    seldom needed in applications where the network topology and
    the Kernel options in effect are known in advance.

  Failure: [;;4mbadarg[0m if the local node is not alive or the option
  list is malformed.
