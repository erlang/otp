[;1m  monitor_node(Node, Flag, Options)[0m

  Behaves as [;;4mmonitor_node/2[0m except that it allows an extra option
  to be specified, namely [;;4mallow_passive_connect[0m.

  This option allows the BIF to wait the normal network connection
  time-out for the monitored node to connect itself, even if it
  cannot be actively connected from this node (that is, it is
  blocked). The state where this can be useful can only be achieved
  by using the Kernel option [;;4mdist_auto_connect once[0m. If that
  option is not used, option [;;4mallow_passive_connect[0m has no effect.

  [;;4mNote[0m

    Option [;;4mallow_passive_connect[0m is used internally and is
    seldom needed in applications where the network topology and
    the Kernel options in effect are known in advance.

  Failure: [;;4mbadarg[0m if the local node is not alive or the option
  list is malformed.
