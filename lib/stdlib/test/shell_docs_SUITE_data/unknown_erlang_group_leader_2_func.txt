  [;1m-spec group_leader(GroupLeader, Pid) -> true[0m
  [;1m                      when GroupLeader :: pid(), Pid :: pid().[0m

  Sets the group leader of [;;4mPid[0m to [;;4mGroupLeader[0m. Typically, this
  is used when a process started from a certain shell is to have
  another group leader than [;;4minit[0m.

  The group leader should be rarely changed in applications with a
  supervision tree, because OTP assumes the group leader of their
  processes is their application master.

  Setting the group leader follows the signal ordering guarantees
  described in the Processes Chapter in the Erlang Reference
  Manual.

  starting and stopping applications.
