  [;1m-spec group_leader(GroupLeader, Pid) -> true[0m
  [;1m                      when GroupLeader :: pid(), Pid :: pid().[0m

  Sets the group leader of [;;4mPid[0m to [;;4mGroupLeader[0m. Typically, this
  is used when a process started from a certain shell is to have
  another group leader than [;;4minit[0m.

  The group leader should be rarely changed in applications with a
  supervision tree, because OTP assumes the group leader of their
  processes is their application master.

  Setting the group leader follows the signal ordering guarantees
  described in the Processes Chapter in the Erlang Reference
  Manual.

  See also [;;4mgroup_leader/0[0m and OTP design principles related to
  starting and stopping applications.

  Note:
    For some important information about distributed signals, see
    the Blocking Signaling Over Distribution section in the 
    Processes chapter of the Erlang Reference Manual.
