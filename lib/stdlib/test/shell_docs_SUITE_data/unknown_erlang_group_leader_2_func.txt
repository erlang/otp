  [;1m-spec group_leader(GroupLeader, Pid) -> true[0m
  [;1m                      when GroupLeader :: pid(), Pid :: pid().[0m

  Sets the group leader of [;;4mPid[0m to [;;4mGroupLeader[0m. Typically, this
  is used when a process started from a certain shell is to have
  another group leader than [;;4minit[0m.

  The group leader should be rarely changed in applications with a
  supervision tree, because OTP assumes the group leader of their
  processes is their application master.

  See also [;;4mgroup_leader/0[0m and OTP design principles related to
  starting and stopping applications.
