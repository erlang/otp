[;;4mSince[0m:
  OTP R16B

  Returns the float whose text representation is [;;4mBinary[0m, for
  example:

    > binary_to_float(<<"2.2017764e+0">>).
    2.2017764

  The float string format is the same as the format for Erlang
  float literals except for that underscores are not permitted.

  Failure: [;;4mbadarg[0m if [;;4mBinary[0m contains a bad representation of a
  float.
