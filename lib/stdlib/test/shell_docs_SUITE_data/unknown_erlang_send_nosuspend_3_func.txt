  The same as [;;4merlang:send(Dest, Msg, [nosuspend | Options])[0m, but
  with a Boolean return value.

  This function behaves like [;;4merlang:send_nosuspend/2[0m, but takes a
  third parameter, a list of options. The only option is [;;4mnoconnect[0m,
  which makes the function return [;;4mfalse[0m if the remote node is not
  currently reachable by the local node. The normal behavior is to
  try to connect to the node, which can stall the process during a
  short period. The use of option [;;4mnoconnect[0m makes it possible to
  be sure not to get the slightest delay when sending to a remote
  process. This is especially useful when communicating with nodes
  that expect to always be the connecting part (that is, nodes
  written in C or Java).

  Whenever the function returns [;;4mfalse[0m (either when a suspend would
  occur or when [;;4mnoconnect[0m was specified and the node was not
  already connected), the message is guaranteed not to have been
  sent.

  Warning:
    Use with extreme care.
