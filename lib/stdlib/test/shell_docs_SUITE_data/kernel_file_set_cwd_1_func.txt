  Sets the current working directory of the file server to [;;4mDir[0m.
  Returns [;;4mok[0m if successful.

  The functions in the module [;;4mfile[0m usually treat binaries as raw
  filenames, that is, they are passed "as is" even when the encoding
  of the binary does not agree with [;;4mnative_name_encoding()[0m.
  However, this function expects binaries to be encoded according to
  the value returned by [;;4mnative_name_encoding()[0m.

  Typical error reasons are:

  [;;4m[;;4menoent[0m[0m:
    The directory does not exist.

  [;;4m[;;4menotdir[0m[0m:
    A component of [;;4mDir[0m is not a directory. On some platforms, [;;4m[0m
    [;;4menoent[0m is returned.

  [;;4m[;;4meacces[0m[0m:
    Missing permission for the directory or one of its parents.

  [;;4m[;;4mbadarg[0m[0m:
    [;;4mDir[0m has an improper type, such as tuple.

  [;;4m[;;4mno_translation[0m[0m:
    [;;4mDir[0m is a [;;4mbinary()[0m with characters coded in ISO-latin-1 and
    the VM is operating with unicode filename encoding.

  Warning:
    In a future release, a bad type for argument [;;4mDir[0m will
    probably generate an exception.
