[;1m  cpu_topology()[0m

  The current cpu topology.

  [;;4mnode[0m refers to Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) nodes. [;;4mthread[0m
  refers to hardware threads (for example, Intel hyper-threads).

  A level in term [;;4mCpuTopology[0m can be omitted if only one entry
  exists and [;;4mInfoList[0m is empty.

  [;;4mthread[0m can only be a sublevel to [;;4mcore[0m. [;;4mcore[0m can be a sublevel
  to [;;4mprocessor[0m or [;;4mnode[0m. [;;4mprocessor[0m can be on the top level or a
  sublevel to [;;4mnode[0m. [;;4mnode[0m can be on the top level or a sublevel
  to [;;4mprocessor[0m. That is, NUMA nodes can be processor internal or
  processor external. A CPU topology can consist of a mix of
  processor internal and external NUMA nodes, as long as each
  logical CPU belongs to one NUMA node. Cache hierarchy is not
  part of the [;;4mCpuTopology[0m type, but will be in a future release.
  Other things can also make it into the CPU topology in a future
  release. So, expect the [;;4mCpuTopology[0m type to change.
