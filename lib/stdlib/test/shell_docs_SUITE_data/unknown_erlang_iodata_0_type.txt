  A binary or list containing bytes and/or iodata. This datatype is
  used to represent data that is meant to be output using any I/O
  module. For example: file:write/2 or gen_tcp:send/2.

  To convert an iodata() term to binary() you can use 
  iolist_to_binary/2. To transcode a string() or 
  unicode:chardata() to iodata() you can use 
  unicode:characters_to_binary/1.
