  [;1m-spec erlang:send(Dest, Msg) -> Msg[0m
  [;1m                     when Dest :: send_destination(), Msg :: term().[0m

  Sends a message and returns [;;4mMsg[0m. This is the same as using the 
  send operator: [;;4mDest ! Msg[0m.

  [;;4mDest[0m can be a remote or local process identifier, an alias, a
  (local) port, a locally registered name, or a tuple [;;4m{RegName,[0m
  [;;4mNode}[0m for a registered name at another node.

  The function fails with a [;;4mbadarg[0m run-time error if [;;4mDest[0m is an
  atom name, but this name is not registered. This is the only case
  when [;;4msend[0m fails for an unreachable destination [;;4mDest[0m (of
  correct type).
