  [;1m                   when[0m
  [;1m                       Term :: term(),[0m

  [;1m                       Size :: non_neg_integer().[0m

  [;;4mRecordTag[0m must be an atom.

  Returns [;;4mtrue[0m if [;;4mTerm[0m is a tuple, its first element is [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mRecordTag[0m, and its size is [;;4mSize[0m. Otherwise returns [;;4mfalse[0m.

  Allowed in guard tests if [;;4mRecordTag[0m is a literal atom and [;;4mSize[0m
  is a literal integer.

  Note:
    This BIF is documented for completeness. Usually [;;4mis_record/2[0m
    is to be used.
