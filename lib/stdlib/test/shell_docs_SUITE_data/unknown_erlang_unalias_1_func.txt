  OTP 24.0

  Deactivate the alias [;;4mAlias[0m previously created by the calling
  process. An alias can for example be created via [;;4malias/0[0m, or [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mmonitor/3[0m. [;;4munalias/1[0m will always deactivate the alias
  regardless of options used when creating the alias.

  Returns true if [;;4mAlias[0m was a currently active alias for current
  processes; otherwise, false.

  For more information on process aliases see the Process Aliases
  section of the Erlang Reference Manual.
