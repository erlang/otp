  Returns information about the process identified by [;;4mPid[0m, as
  specified by [;;4mItem[0m or [;;4mItemList[0m. Returns [;;4mundefined[0m if the
  process is not alive.

  If the process is alive and a single [;;4mItem[0m is specified, the
  returned value is the corresponding [;;4mInfoTuple[0m, unless [;;4mItem =:=[0m
  [;;4mregistered_name[0m and the process has no registered name. In this
  case, [;;4m[][0m is returned. This strange behavior is because of
  historical reasons, and is kept for backward compatibility.

  If [;;4mItemList[0m is specified, the result is [;;4mInfoTupleList[0m. The [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mInfoTuple[0ms in [;;4mInfoTupleList[0m are included with the corresponding [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mItem[0ms in the same order as the [;;4mItem[0ms were included in [;;4mItemList[0m.
  Valid [;;4mItem[0ms can be included multiple times in [;;4mItemList[0m.

  Getting process information follows the signal ordering guarantees
  described in the Processes Chapter in the Erlang Reference
  Manual.

  Note:
    If [;;4mregistered_name[0m is part of [;;4mItemList[0m and the process has
    no name registered, a [;;4m{registered_name, []}[0m, [;;4mInfoTuple[0m 
    will be included in the resulting [;;4mInfoTupleList[0m. This
    behavior is different when a single [;;4mItem =:= registered_name[0m
    is specified, and when [;;4mprocess_info/1[0m is used.

  Valid [;;4mInfoTuple[0ms with corresponding [;;4mItem[0ms:

  [;;4m[;;4m{async_dist, Enabled}[0m[0m:

  [;;4m[;;4m{current_stacktrace, Stack}[0m[0m:
    Returns the current call stack back-trace (stacktrace) of
    the process. The stack has the same format as in the [;;4mcatch[0m
    part of a [;;4mtry[0m. See The call-stack back trace (stacktrace).
    The depth of the stacktrace is truncated according to the [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mbacktrace_depth[0m system flag setting.

  [;;4m[;;4m{dictionary, Dictionary}[0m[0m:

    information about garbage collection for this process. The
    content of [;;4mGCInfo[0m can be changed without prior notice. For
    details about the meaning of each item, see [;;4mgc_minor_start[0m
    in [;;4merlang:trace/3[0m.

  [;;4m[;;4m{group_leader, GroupLeader}[0m[0m:
    [;;4mGroupLeader[0m is the group leader for the I/O of the process.

  [;;4m[;;4m{heap_size, Size}[0m[0m:
    [;;4mSize[0m is the size in words of the youngest heap generation of
    the process. This generation includes the process stack. This
    information is highly implementation-dependent, and can change
    if the implementation changes.

  [;;4m[;;4m{initial_call, {Module, Function, Arity}}[0m[0m:
    [;;4mModule[0m, [;;4mFunction[0m, [;;4mArity[0m is the initial function call with
    which the process was spawned.

    The value is [;;4mfalse[0m if call saving is not active for the
    process (see [;;4mprocess_flag/3[0m). If call saving is active, a
    list is returned, in which the last element is the most recent
    called.

  [;;4m[;;4m{memory, Size}[0m[0m:
    [;;4mSize[0m is the size in bytes of the process. This includes call

    [;;4m[;;4m{port, {RegName, Node}}[0m[0m:
      Local port is monitored by name. Please note, that remote
      port monitors are not supported, so [;;4mNode[0m will always be
      the local node name.

  [;;4m[;;4m{message_queue_data, MQD}[0m[0m:
    [;;4mMQD[0m is the current value of the [;;4mmessage_queue_data[0m process
    flag, which can be either [;;4moff_heap[0m or [;;4mon_heap[0m. For more
    information, see the documentation of [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mprocess_flag(message_queue_data, MQD)[0m.

  [;;4m[;;4m{parent, Pid}[0m[0m:
    [;;4mPid[0m is the identifier of the parent process, the one that
    spawned current process. When the process does not have a
    parent [;;4mundefined[0m is returned. Only the initial process ([;;4m[0m
    [;;4minit[0m) on a node lacks a parent, though.

  [;;4m[;;4m{priority, Level}[0m[0m:
    [;;4mLevel[0m is the current priority level for the process. For more
    information on priorities, see [;;4mprocess_flag(priority, Level)[0m.

  [;;4m[;;4m{reductions, Number}[0m[0m:
    [;;4mNumber[0m is the number of reductions executed by the process.

  [;;4m[;;4m{registered_name, Atom}[0m[0m:
    [;;4mAtom[0m is the registered process name. If the process has no
    registered name, this tuple is not present in the list.

  [;;4m[;;4m{sequential_trace_token, [] | SequentialTraceToken}[0m[0m:
    [;;4mSequentialTraceToken[0m is the sequential trace token for the
    process. This [;;4mInfoTuple[0m can be changed or removed without
    prior notice.

  [;;4m[;;4m{stack_size, Size}[0m[0m:
    [;;4mSize[0m is the stack size, in words, of the process.

  [;;4m[;;4m{status, Status}[0m[0m:
    [;;4mStatus[0m is the status of the process and is one of the
    following:

     • [;;4mexiting[0m

     • [;;4mgarbage_collecting[0m

     • [;;4mwaiting[0m (for a message)

     • [;;4mrunning[0m

     • [;;4mrunnable[0m (ready to run, but another process is running)

     • [;;4msuspended[0m (suspended on a "busy" port or by the BIF [;;4m[0m
       [;;4merlang:suspend_process/1,2[0m)

  [;;4m[;;4m{suspending, SuspendeeList}[0m[0m:
    [;;4mSuspendeeList[0m is a list of [;;4m{Suspendee, ActiveSuspendCount,[0m
    [;;4mOutstandingSuspendCount}[0m tuples. [;;4mSuspendee[0m is the process
    identifier of a process that has been, or is to be, suspended
    by the process identified by [;;4mPid[0m through the BIF [;;4m[0m
    [;;4merlang:suspend_process/2[0m or [;;4merlang:suspend_process/1[0m.

    [;;4mActiveSuspendCount[0m is the number of times [;;4mSuspendee[0m has
    been suspended by [;;4mPid[0m. [;;4mOutstandingSuspendCount[0m is the
    number of not yet completed suspend requests sent by [;;4mPid[0m,
    that is:

     • If [;;4mActiveSuspendCount =/= 0[0m, [;;4mSuspendee[0m is currently
       in the suspended state.

     • If [;;4mOutstandingSuspendCount =/= 0[0m, option [;;4masynchronous[0m
       of [;;4merlang:suspend_process/2[0m has been used and the
       suspendee has not yet been suspended by [;;4mPid[0m.

    Notice that [;;4mActiveSuspendCount[0m and [;;4mOutstandingSuspendCount[0m
    are not the total suspend count on [;;4mSuspendee[0m, only the parts
    contributed by [;;4mPid[0m.

  [;;4m[;;4m{total_heap_size, Size}[0m[0m:
    [;;4mSize[0m is the total size, in words, of all heap fragments of
    the process. This includes the process stack and any
    unreceived messages that are considered to be part of the
    heap.

  [;;4m[;;4m{trace, InternalTraceFlags}[0m[0m:
    [;;4mInternalTraceFlags[0m is an integer representing the internal
    trace flag for this process. This [;;4mInfoTuple[0m can be changed
    or removed without prior notice.

  [;;4m[;;4m{trap_exit, Boolean}[0m[0m:
    [;;4mBoolean[0m is [;;4mtrue[0m if the process is trapping exits, otherwise [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mfalse[0m.

  Notice that not all implementations support all these [;;4mItem[0ms.

  Failures:

  [;;4m[;;4mbadarg[0m[0m:
    If [;;4mPid[0m is not a local process.

  [;;4m[;;4mbadarg[0m[0m:
    If [;;4mItem[0m is an invalid item.
