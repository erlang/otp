[;1m  list_to_atom(String)[0m

  Returns the atom whose text representation is [;;4mString[0m.

  As from Erlang/OTP 20, [;;4mString[0m may contain any Unicode character.
  Earlier versions allowed only ISO-latin-1 characters as the
  implementation did not allow Unicode characters above 255.

  [;;4mNote[0m

    The number of characters that are permitted in an atom name is
    limited. The default limits can be found in the efficiency
    guide (section System Limits).

  [;;4mNote[0m

    There is a configurable limit on how many atoms that can exist
    and atoms are not garbage collected. Therefore, it is
    recommended to consider if [;;4mlist_to_existing_atom/1[0m is a
    better option than [;;4mlist_to_atom/1[0m. The default limits can be
    found in the Efficiency Guide (section System Limits).

  Example:

    > list_to_atom("Erlang").
    'Erlang'
