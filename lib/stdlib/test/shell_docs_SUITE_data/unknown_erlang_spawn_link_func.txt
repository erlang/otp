[;1m  spawn_link(Fun)[0m

  Returns the process identifier of a new process started by the
  application of [;;4mFun[0m to the empty list [;;4m[][0m. A link is created
  between the calling process and the new process, atomically.
  Otherwise works like [;;4mspawn/3[0m.

[;1m  spawn_link(Node, Fun)[0m

  Returns the process identifier (pid) of a new process started by
  the application of [;;4mFun[0m to the empty list [;;4m[][0m on [;;4mNode[0m. A link
  is created between the calling process and the new process,
  atomically. If [;;4mNode[0m does not exist, a useless pid is returned
  and an exit signal with reason [;;4mnoconnection[0m is sent to the
  calling process. Otherwise works like [;;4mspawn/3[0m.

[;1m  spawn_link(Module, Function, Args)[0m

  Returns the process identifier of a new process started by the
  application of [;;4mModule:Function[0m to [;;4mArgs[0m. A link is created
  between the calling process and the new process, atomically.
  Otherwise works like [;;4mspawn/3[0m.
