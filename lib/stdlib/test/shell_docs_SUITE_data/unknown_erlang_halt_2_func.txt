[;1m  halt/2[0m

[;;4mSince[0m:
  OTP R15B01

  Halt the runtime system.

   •   halt(Status :: non_neg_integer(), Options :: halt_options())

     Halt the runtime system with status code [;;4mStatus[0m.

  [;;4mNote[0m

       On many platforms, the OS supports only status codes
       0-255. A too large status code is truncated by clearing
       the high bits.

     Currently the following options are valid:

      ￮ [;;4m{flush, EnableFlushing}[0m - If [;;4mEnableFlushing[0m equals [;;4m[0m
        [;;4mtrue[0m, which also is the default behavior, the runtime
        system will perform the following operations before
        terminating:

         ◼ Flush all outstanding output.

         ◼ Send all Erlang ports exit signals and wait for
           them to exit.

         ◼ Wait for all async threads to complete all
           outstanding async jobs.

         ◼ Call all installed NIF on halt callbacks.

         ◼ Wait for all ongoing NIF calls with the delay
           halt setting enabled to return.

         ◼ Call all installed [;;4matexit[0m/[;;4mon_exit[0m callbacks.

        If [;;4mEnableFlushing[0m equals [;;4mfalse[0m, the runtime system
        will terminate immediately without performing any of
        the above listed operations.

  [;;4mChange[0m

          Runtime systems prior to OTP 26.0 called all
          installed [;;4matexit[0m/[;;4mon_exit[0m callbacks also when [;;4m[0m
          [;;4mflush[0m was disabled, but as of OTP 26.0 this is no
          longer the case.

      ￮ [;;4m{flush_timeout, Timeout :: 0..2147483647 | infinity}[0m -
        Sets a limit on the time allowed for flushing prior to
        termination of the runtime system. [;;4mTimeout[0m is in
        milliseconds. The default value is determined by the
        the [;;4merl[0m [;;4m+zhft <Timeout>[0m command line flag.

        If flushing has been ongoing for [;;4mTimeout[0m
        milliseconds, flushing operations will be interrupted
        and the runtime system will immediately be terminated
        with the exit code [;;4m255[0m. If flushing is not enabled,
        the timeout will have no effect on the system.

        See also the [;;4merl[0m [;;4m+zhft <Timeout>[0m command line
        flag. Note that the shortest timeout set by the
        command line flag and the [;;4mflush_timeout[0m option will
        be the actual timeout value in effect.

        Since: OTP 27.0

   •   halt(Abort :: abort, Options :: halt_options())

     Halt the Erlang runtime system by aborting and produce a
     core dump if core dumping has been enabled in the
     environment that the runtime system is executing in.

  [;;4mNote[0m

       The [;;4m{flush, boolean()}[0m option will be ignored, and
       flushing will be disabled.

   •   halt(CrashDumpSlogan :: string(), Options :: halt_options())

     Halt the Erlang runtime system and generate an Erlang crash
     dump. The string [;;4mCrashDumpSlogan[0m will be used as slogan in
     the Erlang crash dump created. The slogan will be trunkated
     if [;;4mCrashDumpSlogan[0m is longer than 1023 characters.

  [;;4mNote[0m

       The [;;4m{flush, boolean()}[0m option will be ignored, and
       flushing will be disabled.

  [;;4mChange[0m

       Behavior changes compared to earlier versions:

        ￮ Before OTP 24.2, the slogan was truncated if [;;4m[0m
          [;;4mCrashDumpSlogan[0m was longer than 200 characters.
          Now it will be truncated if longer than 1023
          characters.

        ￮ Before OTP 20.1, only code points in the range
          0-255 were accepted in the slogan. Now any Unicode
          string is valid.
