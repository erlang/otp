  [;1m              no_return().[0m

[;;4mSince[0m:
  OTP R15B01

  Types:
    -type halt_options() :: [{flush, boolean()}].

  Halt the runtime system with status code [;;4mStatus[0m.

  Note:
    On many platforms, the OS supports only status codes 0-255. A
    too large status code is truncated by clearing the high bits.

  Currently the following options are valid:

  [;;4m[;;4m{flush, EnableFlushing}[0m[0m:
    If [;;4mEnableFlushing[0m equals [;;4mtrue[0m, which also is the default
    behavior, the runtime system will perform the following
    operations before terminating:

     â€¢ Flush all outstanding output.

     â€¢ Send all Erlang ports exit signals and wait for them to
       exit.

     â€¢ Wait for all async threads to complete all outstanding
       async jobs.

     â€¢ Call all installed NIF on halt callbacks.

     â€¢ Wait for all ongoing NIF calls with the delay halt
       setting enabled to return.

     â€¢ Call all installed [;;4matexit[0m/[;;4mon_exit[0m callbacks.

    If [;;4mEnableFlushing[0m equals [;;4mfalse[0m, the runtime system will
    terminate immediately without performing any of the above
    listed operations.

    Change:
      Runtime systems prior to OTP 26.0 called all installed [;;4m[0m
      [;;4matexit[0m/[;;4mon_exit[0m callbacks also when [;;4mflush[0m was
      disabled, but as of OTP 26.0 this is no longer the case.

  [;1m-spec halt(Abort :: abort, Options :: halt_options()) -> no_return().[0m

[;;4mSince[0m:
  OTP R15B01

  Types:
    -type halt_options() :: [{flush, boolean()}].

  Halt the Erlang runtime system by aborting and produce a core dump
  if core dumping has been enabled in the environment that the
  runtime system is executing in.

  Note:
    The [;;4m{flush, boolean()}[0m option will be ignored, and flushing
    will be disabled.

  [;1m-spec halt(CrashDumpSlogan :: string(), Options :: halt_options()) ->[0m
  [;1m              no_return().[0m

[;;4mSince[0m:
  OTP R15B01

  Types:
    -type halt_options() :: [{flush, boolean()}].

  Halt the Erlang runtime system and generate an Erlang crash dump.
  The string [;;4mCrashDumpSlogan[0m will be used as slogan in the Erlang
  crash dump created. The slogan will be trunkated if [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mCrashDumpSlogan[0m is longer than 1023 characters.

  Note:
    The [;;4m{flush, boolean()}[0m option will be ignored, and flushing
    will be disabled.

  Behavior changes compared to earlier versions:

   â€¢ Before OTP 24.2, the slogan was truncated if [;;4m[0m
     [;;4mCrashDumpSlogan[0m was longer than 200 characters. Now it will
     be truncated if longer than 1023 characters.

   â€¢ Before OTP 20.1, only code points in the range 0-255 were
     accepted in the slogan. Now any Unicode string is valid.
