[;1m  del_dir(Dir)[0m

  Tries to delete directory [;;4mDir[0m. The directory must be empty
  before it can be deleted. Returns [;;4mok[0m if successful.

  Typical error reasons:

   • [;;4meacces[0m - Missing search or write permissions for the parent
     directories of [;;4mDir[0m.

   • [;;4meexist[0m - The directory is not empty.

   • [;;4menoent[0m - The directory does not exist.

   • [;;4menotdir[0m - A component of [;;4mDir[0m is not a directory. On some
     platforms, [;;4menoent[0m is returned instead.

   • [;;4meinval[0m - Attempt to delete the current directory. On some
     platforms, [;;4meacces[0m is returned instead.
