  [;1m                when Family :: family(), Tuples :: [tuple()].[0m

  Creates a family of subsets. [;;4mfamily(F,Â T)[0m is equivalent to [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mfrom_term(F,Â T)[0m if the result is a family. If no type is
  explicitly specified, [;;4m[{atom,Â [atom]}][0m is used as the family
