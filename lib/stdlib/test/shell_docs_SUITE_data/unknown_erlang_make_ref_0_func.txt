  [;1m-spec make_ref() -> reference().[0m

  Returns a unique reference. The reference is unique among
  connected nodes.

  Warning:
    Before OTP-23 when a node is restarted multiple times with the
    same node name, references created on a newer node can be
    mistaken for a reference created on an older node with the
    same node name.
