[;1m  size(Item)[0m

  Returns the number of elements in a tuple or the number of bytes
  in a binary or bitstring.

  For example:

    > size({morni, mulle, bwange}).
    3
    > size(<<11, 22, 33>>).
    3

  For bitstrings, the number of whole bytes is returned. That is, if
  the number of bits in the bitstring is not divisible by 8, the
  resulting number of bytes is rounded down.
