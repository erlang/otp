[;1m  trunc(Number)[0m

  Truncates the decimals of [;;4mNumber[0m.

  For example:

    > trunc(5.7).
    5

    > trunc(-5.7).
    -5

    > trunc(5).
    5

    > trunc(36028797018963969.0).
    36028797018963968

  In the last example, [;;4mtrunc(36028797018963969.0)[0m evaluates to [;;4m[0m
  [;;4m36028797018963968[0m. The reason for this is that the number [;;4m[0m
  [;;4m36028797018963969.0[0m cannot be represented exactly as a float
  value. Instead, the float literal is represented as [;;4m[0m
  [;;4m36028797018963968.0[0m, which is the closest number that can be
  represented exactly as a float value. See Representation of
  Floating Point Numbers for additional information.
