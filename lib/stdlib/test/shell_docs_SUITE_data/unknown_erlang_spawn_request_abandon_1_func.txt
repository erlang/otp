  [;1m-spec spawn_request_abandon(ReqId :: reference()) -> boolean().[0m

[;;4mSince[0m:
  OTP 23.0

  Abandon a previously issued spawn request. [;;4mReqId[0m corresponds to
  a request identifier previously returned by [;;4mspawn_request()[0m in a
  call from current process. That is, only the process that has made
  the request can abandon the request.

  A spawn request can only be successfully abandoned until the spawn
  request has completed. When a spawn request has been successfully
  abandoned, the caller will not be effected by future direct
  effects of the spawn request itself. For example, it will not
  receive a spawn reply message. The request is however not
  withdrawn, so a new process may or may not be created due to the
  request. If a new process is created after the spawn request was
  abandoned, no monitors nor links will be set up to the caller of [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mspawn_request_abandon/1[0m due to the spawn request. If the spawn
  request included the [;;4mlink[0m option, the process created due to
  this request will be sent an exit signal from its parent with the
  exit reason [;;4mabandoned[0m when it is detected that the spawn
  operation has succeeded.

  Note:
    A process created due to a spawn request that has been
    abandoned may communicate with its parent as any other
    process. It is only the direct effects on the parent of the
    actual spawn request, that will be canceled by abandoning a
    spawn request.

  Return values:

  [;;4m[;;4mtrue[0m[0m:
    The spawn request was successfully abandoned.

  [;;4m[;;4mfalse[0m[0m:
    No spawn request was abandoned. The [;;4mReqId[0m request identifier
    did not correspond to an outstanding spawn request issued by
    the calling process. The reason for this is either:

     â€¢ [;;4mReqId[0m corresponds to a spawn request previoulsy made by
       the calling process. The spawn operation has completed
       and a spawn reply has already been delivered to the
       calling process unless the spawn reply was disabled in
       the request.

     â€¢ [;;4mReqId[0m does not correspond to a spawn request that has
       been made by the calling process.

  This function fail with a [;;4mbadarg[0m exception if [;;4mReqId[0m is not a
  reference.
