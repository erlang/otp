  [;1m-spec disconnect_node(Node) -> boolean() | ignored when Node :: node().[0m

  Forces the disconnection of a node. This appears to the node [;;4mNode[0m
  as if the local node has crashed. This BIF is mainly used in the
  Erlang network authentication protocols.

  Returns [;;4mtrue[0m if disconnection succeeds, otherwise [;;4mfalse[0m. If
  the local node is not alive, [;;4mignored[0m is returned.

  Note:
    This function may return before [;;4mnodedown[0m messages have been
    delivered.
