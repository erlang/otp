  [;1m                                SetOfSets :: set_of_sets().[0m

  Returns the binary relation containing the elements (E,Â Set) such
  that Set belongs to [;;4mSetOfSets[0m and E belongs to Set. If [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mSetOfSets[0m is a partition of a set X and R is the equivalence
  relation in X induced by [;;4mSetOfSets[0m, then the returned relation
  is the canonical map from X onto the equivalence classes with
  respect to R.
