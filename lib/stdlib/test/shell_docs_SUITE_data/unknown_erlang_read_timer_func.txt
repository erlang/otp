[;;4mSince[0m:
  OTP 18.0

  Reads the state of a timer that has been created by either [;;4m[0m
  [;;4merlang:start_timer[0m or [;;4merlang:send_after[0m. [;;4mTimerRef[0m identifies
  the timer, and was returned by the BIF that created the timer.

  [;;4mOptions[0m:

  [;;4m[;;4m{async, Async}[0m[0m:
    Asynchronous request for state information. [;;4mAsync[0m defaults
    to [;;4mfalse[0m, which causes the operation to be performed
    synchronously. In this case, the [;;4mResult[0m is returned by [;;4m[0m
    [;;4merlang:read_timer[0m. When [;;4mAsync[0m is [;;4mtrue[0m, [;;4merlang:read_timer[0m
    sends an asynchronous request for the state information to the
    timer service that manages the timer, and then returns [;;4mok[0m. A
    message on the format [;;4m{read_timer, TimerRef, Result}[0m is sent
    to the caller of [;;4merlang:read_timer[0m when the operation has
    been processed.

  More [;;4mOption[0ms can be added in the future.

  If [;;4mResult[0m is an integer, it represents the time in milliseconds
  left until the timer expires.

  If [;;4mResult[0m is [;;4mfalse[0m, a timer corresponding to [;;4mTimerRef[0m could
  not be found. This because the timer had expired, or been
  canceled, or because [;;4mTimerRef[0m never has corresponded to a timer.
  Even if the timer has expired, it does not tell you whether or not
  the time-out message has arrived at its destination yet.

  Note:
    The timer service that manages the timer can be co-located
    with another scheduler than the scheduler that the calling
    process is executing on. If so, communication with the timer
    service takes much longer time than if it is located locally.
    If the calling process is in a critical path, and can do other
    things while waiting for the result of this operation, you
    want to use option [;;4m{async, true}[0m. If using option [;;4m{async,[0m
    [;;4mfalse}[0m, the calling process is blocked until the operation
    has been performed.

  See also [;;4merlang:send_after/4[0m, [;;4merlang:start_timer/4[0m, and [;;4m[0m
  [;;4merlang:cancel_timer/2[0m.
