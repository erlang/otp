[;1m  suspend_process(Suspendee, OptList)[0m

  Increases the suspend count on the process identified by [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mSuspendee[0m and puts it in the suspended state if it is not already
  in that state. A suspended process is not scheduled for execution
  until the process has been resumed. If the suspended process
  currently is waiting in a [;;4mreceive ... after[0m expression, the
  timer for the timeout will, as of OTP 28.0, also be suspended
  until the process is resumed.

  A process can be suspended by multiple processes and can be
  suspended multiple times by a single process. A suspended process
  does not leave the suspended state until its suspend count reaches
  zero. The suspend count of [;;4mSuspendee[0m is decreased when [;;4m[0m
  [;;4merlang:resume_process(Suspendee)[0m is called by the same process
  that called [;;4merlang:suspend_process(Suspendee)[0m. All increased
  suspend counts on other processes acquired by a process are
  automatically decreased when the process terminates.

  Options ([;;4mOpt[0ms):

   • [;;4masynchronous[0m - A suspend request is sent to the process
     identified by [;;4mSuspendee[0m. [;;4mSuspendee[0m eventually suspends
     unless it is resumed before it could suspend. The caller of [;;4m[0m
     [;;4merlang:suspend_process/2[0m returns immediately, regardless of
     whether [;;4mSuspendee[0m has suspended yet or not. The point in
     time when [;;4mSuspendee[0m suspends cannot be deduced from other
     events in the system. It is only guaranteed that [;;4mSuspendee[0m 
     eventually suspends (unless it is resumed). If no [;;4m[0m
     [;;4masynchronous[0m options has been passed, the caller of [;;4m[0m
     [;;4merlang:suspend_process/2[0m is blocked until [;;4mSuspendee[0m has
     suspended.

   • [;;4m{asynchronous, ReplyTag}[0m - A suspend request is sent to the
     process identified by [;;4mSuspendee[0m. When the suspend request
     has been processed, a reply message is sent to the caller of
     this function. The reply is on the form [;;4m{ReplyTag, State}[0m
     where [;;4mState[0m is either:

      ￮ [;;4mexited[0m - [;;4mSuspendee[0m has exited.

      ￮ [;;4msuspended[0m - [;;4mSuspendee[0m is now suspended.

      ￮ [;;4mnot_suspended[0m - [;;4mSuspendee[0m is not suspended. This
        can only happen when the process that issued this
        request, have called [;;4mresume_process(Suspendee)[0m
        before getting the reply.

     Apart from the reply message, the [;;4m{asynchronous, ReplyTag}[0m
     option behaves exactly the same as the [;;4masynchronous[0m option
     without reply tag.

   • [;;4munless_suspending[0m - The process identified by [;;4mSuspendee[0m
     is suspended unless the calling process already is
     suspending [;;4mSuspendee[0m. If [;;4munless_suspending[0m is combined
     with option [;;4masynchronous[0m, a suspend request is sent unless
     the calling process already is suspending [;;4mSuspendee[0m or if
     a suspend request already has been sent and is in transit.
     If the calling process already is suspending [;;4mSuspendee[0m, or
     if combined with option [;;4masynchronous[0m and a send request
     already is in transit, [;;4mfalse[0m is returned and the suspend
     count on [;;4mSuspendee[0m remains unchanged.

  If the suspend count on the process identified by [;;4mSuspendee[0m is
  increased, [;;4mtrue[0m is returned, otherwise [;;4mfalse[0m.

  [;;4mWarning[0m

    This BIF is intended for debugging only.

  [;;4mWarning[0m

    You can easily create deadlocks if processes suspends each
    other (directly or in circles). In ERTS versions prior to ERTS
    version 10.0, the runtime system prevented such deadlocks, but
    this prevention has now been removed due to performance
    reasons.

  Failures:

   • [;;4mbadarg[0m - If [;;4mSuspendee[0m is not a process identifier.

   • [;;4mbadarg[0m - If the process identified by [;;4mSuspendee[0m is the
     same process as the process calling [;;4m[0m
     [;;4merlang:suspend_process/2[0m.

   • [;;4mbadarg[0m - If the process identified by [;;4mSuspendee[0m is not
     alive.

   • [;;4mbadarg[0m - If the process identified by [;;4mSuspendee[0m resides
     on another node.

   • [;;4mbadarg[0m - If [;;4mOptList[0m is not a proper list of valid [;;4mOpt[0ms.

   • [;;4msystem_limit[0m - If the process identified by [;;4mSuspendee[0m has
     been suspended more times by the calling process than can be
     represented by the currently used internal data structures.
     The system limit is greater than 2,000,000,000 suspends and
     will never be lower.
