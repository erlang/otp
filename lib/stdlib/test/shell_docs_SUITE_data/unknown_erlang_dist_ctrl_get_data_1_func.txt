  Get distribution channel data from the local node that is to be
  passed to the remote node. The distribution channel is identified
  by [;;4mDHandle[0m. If no data is available, the atom [;;4mnone[0m is
  returned. One can request to be informed by a message when more
  data is available by calling [;;4m[0m
  [;;4merlang:dist_ctrl_get_data_notification(DHandle)[0m.

  The returned value when there are data available depends on the
  value of the [;;4mget_size[0m option configured on the distribution
  channel identified by [;;4mDHandle[0m. For more information see the
  documentation of the [;;4mget_size[0m option for the [;;4m[0m
  [;;4merlang:dist_ctrl_set_opt/3[0m function.

  Note:
    Only the process registered as distribution controller for the
    distribution channel identified by [;;4mDHandle[0m is allowed to
    call this function.

  This function is used when implementing an alternative
  distribution carrier using processes as distribution controllers. [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mDHandle[0m is retrieved via the callback [;;4mf_handshake_complete[0m.
  More information can be found in the documentation of ERTS User's
  Guide âžœ How to implement an Alternative Carrier for the Erlang
  Distribution âžœ Distribution Module.
