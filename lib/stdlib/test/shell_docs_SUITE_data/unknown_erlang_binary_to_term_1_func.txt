  Returns an Erlang term that is the result of decoding binary
  object [;;4mBinary[0m, which must be encoded according to the Erlang
  external term format.

    > Bin = term_to_binary(hello).

    > hello = binary_to_term(Bin).

  Warning:
    When decoding binaries from untrusted sources, the untrusted
    source may submit data in a way to create resources, such as
    atoms and remote references, that cannot be garbage collected
    and lead to Denial of Service attack. In such cases, consider
    using [;;4mbinary_to_term/2[0m with the [;;4msafe[0m option.

  See also [;;4mterm_to_binary/1[0m and [;;4mbinary_to_term/2[0m.
