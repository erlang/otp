  [;1m-spec erlang:send(Dest, Msg) -> Msg[0m
  [;1m                     when Dest :: send_destination(), Msg :: term().[0m

  Sends a message and returns [;;4mMsg[0m. This is the same as using the 
  send operator: [;;4mDest ! Msg[0m.

  [;;4mDest[0m can be a remote or local process identifier, an alias, a
  (local) port, a locally registered name, or a tuple [;;4m{RegName,[0m
  [;;4mNode}[0m for a registered name at another node.

  The function fails with a [;;4mbadarg[0m run-time error if [;;4mDest[0m is an
  atom name, but this name is not registered. This is the only case
  when [;;4msend[0m fails for an unreachable destination [;;4mDest[0m (of
  correct type).

    the Blocking Signaling Over Distribution section in the 
    Processes chapter of the Erlang Reference Manual.

  Either sends a message and returns [;;4mok[0m, or does not send the
  message but returns something else (see below). Otherwise the same
  as [;;4merlang:send/2[0m. For more detailed explanation and warnings,
  see [;;4merlang:send_nosuspend/2,3[0m.

  Options:

  [;;4m[;;4mnosuspend[0m[0m:
    If the sender would have to be suspended to do the send, [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mnosuspend[0m is returned instead.

  [;;4m[;;4mnoconnect[0m[0m:
    If the destination node would have to be auto-connected to do
    the send, [;;4mnoconnect[0m is returned instead.

  Note:
    For some important information about distributed signals, see
    the Blocking Signaling Over Distribution section in the 
    Processes chapter of the Erlang Reference Manual.

  Warning:
    As with [;;4merlang:send_nosuspend/2,3[0m: use with extreme care.
