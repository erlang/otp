  Creates a relation. [;;4mrelation(R,Â T)[0m is equivalent to [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mfrom_term(R,Â T)[0m, if T is a type and the result is a relation.
  If [;;4mType[0m is an integer N, then [;;4m[{atom,Â ...,Â atom}])[0m, where the
  tuple size is N, is used as type of the relation. If no type is
  explicitly specified, the size of the first tuple of [;;4mTuples[0m is
  used if there is such a tuple. [;;4mrelation([])[0m is equivalent to [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mrelation([],Â 2)[0m.
