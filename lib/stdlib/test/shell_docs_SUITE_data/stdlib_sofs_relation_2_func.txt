[;1m  relation(Tuples, Type)[0m

  Creates a relation. [;;4mrelation(R, T)[0m is equivalent to [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mfrom_term(R, T)[0m, if T is a type and the result is a relation.

  If [;;4mType[0m is an integer N, then [;;4m[{atom, ..., atom}])[0m, where the
  tuple size is N, is used as type of the relation.
