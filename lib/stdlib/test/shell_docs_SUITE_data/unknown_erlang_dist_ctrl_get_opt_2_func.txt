  Returns the value of the [;;4mget_size[0m option on the distribution
  channel identified by [;;4mDHandle[0m. For more information see the
  documentation of the [;;4mget_size[0m option for the [;;4m[0m
  [;;4merlang:dist_ctrl_set_opt/3[0m function.

  Note:
    Only the process registered as distribution controller for the
    distribution channel identified by [;;4mDHandle[0m is allowed to
    call this function.

  This function is used when implementing an alternative
  distribution carrier using processes as distribution controllers. [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mDHandle[0m is retrieved via the callback [;;4mf_handshake_complete[0m.

  Guide âžœ How to implement an Alternative Carrier for the Erlang
  Distribution âžœ Distribution Module.
