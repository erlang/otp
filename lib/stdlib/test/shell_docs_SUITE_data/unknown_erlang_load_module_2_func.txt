  If [;;4mBinary[0m contains the object code for module [;;4mModule[0m, this BIF
  loads that object code. If the code for module [;;4mModule[0m already
  exists, all export references are replaced so they point to the
  newly loaded code. The previously loaded code is kept in the
  system as old code, as there can still be processes executing that
  code.

  Returns either [;;4m{module, Module}[0m, or [;;4m{error, Reason}[0m if loading
  fails. [;;4mReason[0m is one of the following:

  [;;4m[;;4mbadfile[0m[0m:
    The object code in [;;4mBinary[0m has an incorrect format or the
    object code contains code for another module than [;;4mModule[0m.

  [;;4m[;;4mnot_purged[0m[0m:
    [;;4mBinary[0m contains a module that cannot be loaded because old
    code for this module already exists.

  [;;4m[;;4mon_load[0m[0m:
    The code in [;;4mBinary[0m contains an [;;4mon_load[0m declaration that
    must be executed before [;;4mBinary[0m can become the current code.
    Any previous current code for [;;4mModule[0m will remain until the [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mon_load[0m call has finished.

  [;;4mnot_allowed[0m:
    The code in [;;4mBinary[0m has been compiled with features that are
    currently not enabled in the runtime system.

  Warning:
    This BIF is intended for the code server (see [;;4mcode(3)[0m) and
    is not to be used elsewhere.
