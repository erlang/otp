  [;1m                   Module :: module(),[0m
  [;1m                   Function :: atom(),[0m
  [;1m                   Args :: [term()].[0m

  Returns the result of applying [;;4mFunction[0m in [;;4mModule[0m to [;;4mArgs[0m.
  The applied function must be exported from [;;4mModule[0m. The arity of
  the function is the length of [;;4mArgs[0m. Example:

    > apply(lists, reverse, [[a, b, c]]).
    [c,b,a]
    > apply(erlang, atom_to_list, ['Erlang']).
    "Erlang"

  If the number of arguments are known at compile time, the call is
  better written as [;;4mModule:Function(Arg1, Arg2, ..., ArgN)[0m.

  Failure: [;;4merror_handler:undefined_function/3[0m is called if the
  applied function is not exported. The error handler can be
  redefined (see [;;4mprocess_flag/2[0m). If [;;4merror_handler[0m is undefined,
  or if the user has redefined the default [;;4merror_handler[0m so the
  replacement module is undefined, an error with reason [;;4mundef[0m is
  generated.
