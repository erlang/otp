  Searches the path [;;4mPath[0m (a list of directory names) until the
  file [;;4mFilename[0m is found. If [;;4mFilename[0m is an absolute filename, [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mPath[0m is ignored. Then reads and evaluates Erlang expressions,
  separated by '.' (or ',', a sequence of expressions is also an
  expression), from the file. The result of evaluation is not
  returned; any expression sequence in the file must be there for
  its side effect.

  Returns one of the following:

  [;;4m[;;4m{ok, FullName}[0m[0m:
    The file is read and evaluated. [;;4mFullName[0m is the full name of
    the file.

  [;;4m[;;4m{error, enoent}[0m[0m:
    The file cannot be found in any of the directories in [;;4mPath[0m.

  [;;4m[;;4m{error, atom()}[0m[0m:
    An error occurred when opening the file or reading it. For a
    list of typical error codes, see [;;4mopen/2[0m.

  [;;4m[;;4m{error, {Line, Mod, Term}}[0m[0m:
    An error occurred when interpreting the Erlang expressions in
    the file. Use [;;4mformat_error/1[0m to convert the three-element
    tuple to an English description of the error.

  The encoding of [;;4mFilename[0m can be set by a comment as described in [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mepp(3)[0m.
