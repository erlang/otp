  Returns the process identifier of a new process started by the
  application of [;;4mFun[0m to the empty list [;;4m[][0m. Otherwise works like [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mspawn/3[0m.

  Returns the process identifier of a new process started by the

  does not exist, a useless pid is returned. Otherwise works like [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mspawn/3[0m.

  [;;4merror_handler:undefined_function(Module, Function, Args)[0m is
  evaluated by the new process if [;;4mModule:Function/Arity[0m does not
  exist (where [;;4mArity[0m is the length of [;;4mArgs[0m). The error handler
  can be redefined (see [;;4mprocess_flag/2[0m). If [;;4merror_handler[0m is
  undefined, or the user has redefined the default [;;4merror_handler[0m
  and its replacement is undefined, a failure with reason [;;4mundef[0m
  occurs.
