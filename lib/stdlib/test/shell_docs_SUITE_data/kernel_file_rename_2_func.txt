[;1m  rename(Source, Destination)[0m

  Tries to rename the file [;;4mSource[0m to [;;4mDestination[0m. It can be used
  to move files (and directories) between directories, but it is not
  sufficient to specify the destination only. The destination
  filename must also be specified. For example, if [;;4mbar[0m is a normal
  file and [;;4mfoo[0m and [;;4mbaz[0m are directories, [;;4mrename("foo/bar",[0m
  [;;4m"baz")[0m returns an error, but [;;4mrename("foo/bar", "baz/bar")[0m
  succeeds. Returns [;;4mok[0m if it is successful.

  [;;4mNote[0m

    Renaming of open files is not allowed on most platforms (see [;;4m[0m
    [;;4meacces[0m below).

  Typical error reasons:

   • [;;4meacces[0m - Missing read or write permissions for the parent
     directories of [;;4mSource[0m or [;;4mDestination[0m. On some platforms,
     this error is given if either [;;4mSource[0m or [;;4mDestination[0m is
     open.

   • [;;4meexist[0m - [;;4mDestination[0m is not an empty directory. On some
     platforms, also given when [;;4mSource[0m and [;;4mDestination[0m are
     not of the same type.

   • [;;4meinval[0m - [;;4mSource[0m is a root directory, or [;;4mDestination[0m is
     a subdirectory of [;;4mSource[0m.

   • [;;4meisdir[0m - [;;4mDestination[0m is a directory, but [;;4mSource[0m is not.

   • [;;4menoent[0m - [;;4mSource[0m does not exist.

   • [;;4menotdir[0m - [;;4mSource[0m is a directory, but [;;4mDestination[0m is
     not.

   • [;;4mexdev[0m - [;;4mSource[0m and [;;4mDestination[0m are on different file
     systems.
