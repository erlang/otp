  Returns a binary data object that is the result of encoding [;;4mTerm[0m
  according to the Erlang external term format.

  If option [;;4mcompressed[0m is provided, the external term format is
  compressed. The compressed format is automatically recognized by [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mbinary_to_term/1[0m as from Erlang/OTP R7B.

  A compression level can be specified by giving option [;;4m[0m
  [;;4m{compressed, Level}[0m. [;;4mLevel[0m is an integer with range 0..9,
  where:

   • [;;4m0[0m - No compression is done (it is the same as giving no [;;4m[0m
     [;;4mcompressed[0m option).

   • [;;4m1[0m - Takes least time but may not compress as well as the
     higher levels.

   • [;;4m6[0m - Default level when option [;;4mcompressed[0m is provided.

   • [;;4m9[0m - Takes most time and tries to produce a smaller result.
     Notice "tries" in the preceding sentence; depending on the
     input term, level 9 compression either does or does not
     produce a smaller result than level 1 compression.

  Option [;;4m{minor_version, Version}[0m can be used to control some
  encoding details. This option was introduced in Erlang/OTP R11B-4.
  The valid values for [;;4mVersion[0m are:

  [;;4m[;;4m0[0m[0m:
    Floats are encoded using a textual representation. This option
    is useful to ensure that releases before Erlang/OTP R11B-4 can
    decode resulting binary.

    This version encode atoms that can be represented by a latin1
    string using latin1 encoding while only atoms that cannot be
    represented by latin1 are encoded using utf8.

  [;;4m[;;4m1[0m[0m:
    This is as of Erlang/OTP 17.0 the default. It forces any
    floats in the term to be encoded in a more space-efficient and
    exact way (namely in the 64-bit IEEE format, rather than
    converted to a textual representation). As from Erlang/OTP
    R11B-4, [;;4mbinary_to_term/1[0m can decode this representation.

    This version encode atoms that can be represented by a latin1
    string using latin1 encoding while only atoms that cannot be
    represented by latin1 are encoded using utf8.

  [;;4m[;;4m2[0m[0m:
    Drops usage of the latin1 atom encoding and unconditionally
    use utf8 encoding for all atoms. This will be changed to the
    default in a future major release of Erlang/OTP. Erlang/OTP
    systems as of R16B can decode this representation.
