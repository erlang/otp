  Decreases the suspend count on the process identified by [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mSuspendee[0m. [;;4mSuspendee[0m is previously to have been suspended
  through [;;4merlang:suspend_process/2[0m or [;;4merlang:suspend_process/1[0m
  by the process calling [;;4merlang:resume_process(Suspendee)[0m. When
  the suspend count on [;;4mSuspendee[0m reaches zero, [;;4mSuspendee[0m is
  resumed, that is, its state is changed from suspended into the
  state it had before it was suspended.

  Warning:
    This BIF is intended for debugging only.

  Failures:

  [;;4m[;;4mbadarg[0m[0m:

  [;;4m[;;4mbadarg[0m[0m:
    If the process calling [;;4merlang:resume_process/1[0m had not
    previously increased the suspend count on the process
    identified by [;;4mSuspendee[0m.

  [;;4m[;;4mbadarg[0m[0m:
    If the process identified by [;;4mSuspendee[0m is not alive.
