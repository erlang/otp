[;1m  resume_process(Suspendee)[0m

  Decreases the suspend count on the process identified by [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mSuspendee[0m.

  [;;4mSuspendee[0m is previously to have been suspended through [;;4m[0m
  [;;4merlang:suspend_process/2[0m or [;;4merlang:suspend_process/1[0m by the
  process calling [;;4merlang:resume_process(Suspendee)[0m. When the
  suspend count on [;;4mSuspendee[0m reaches zero, [;;4mSuspendee[0m is resumed,
  that is, its state is changed from suspended into the state it had
  before it was suspended.

  [;;4mWarning[0m

    This BIF is intended for debugging only.

  Failures:

   • [;;4mbadarg[0m - If [;;4mSuspendee[0m is not a process identifier.

   • [;;4mbadarg[0m - If the process calling [;;4merlang:resume_process/1[0m
     had not previously increased the suspend count on the
     process identified by [;;4mSuspendee[0m.

   • [;;4mbadarg[0m - If the process identified by [;;4mSuspendee[0m is not
     alive.
