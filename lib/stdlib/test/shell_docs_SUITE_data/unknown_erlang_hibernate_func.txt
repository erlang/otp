[;1m  hibernate()[0m

[;;4mSince[0m:
  OTP @OTP-19503@

  Puts the calling process into a wait state where its memory
  allocation has been reduced as much as possible. This is useful if
  the process does not expect to receive any messages soon.

  The process is awakened when a message is sent to it, and control
  resumes normally to the caller. Unlike [;;4merlang:hibernate/3[0m, it
  does not discard the call stack.

[;1m  hibernate(Module, Function, Args)[0m

  Puts the calling process into a wait state where its memory
  allocation has been reduced as much as possible. This is useful if
  the process does not expect to receive any messages soon.

  The process is awakened when a message is sent to it, and control
  resumes in [;;4mModule:Function[0m with the arguments specified by [;;4mArgs[0m
  with the call stack emptied, meaning that the process terminates
  when that function returns. Thus [;;4merlang:hibernate/3[0m never
  returns to its caller. The resume function [;;4mModule:Function/Arity[0m
  must be exported ([;;4mArity[0m =:= [;;4mlength(Args)[0m).

  If the process has any message in its message queue, the process
  is awakened immediately in the same way as described earlier.

  In more technical terms, [;;4merlang:hibernate/3[0m discards the call
  stack for the process, and then garbage collects the process.
  After this, all live data is in one continuous heap. The heap is
  then shrunken to the exact same size as the live data that it
  holds (even if that size is less than the minimum heap size for
  the process).

  If the size of the live data in the process is less than the
  minimum heap size, the first garbage collection occurring after
  the process is awakened ensures that the heap size is changed to a
  size not smaller than the minimum heap size.

  Notice that emptying the call stack means that any surrounding [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mcatch[0m is removed and must be re-inserted after hibernation. One
  effect of this is that processes started using [;;4mproc_lib[0m (also
  indirectly, such as [;;4mgen_server[0m processes), are to use [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mproc_lib:hibernate/3[0m instead, to ensure that the exception
  handler continues to work when the process wakes up.
