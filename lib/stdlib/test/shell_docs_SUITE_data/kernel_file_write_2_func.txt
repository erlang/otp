[;1m  write(IoDevice, Bytes)[0m

  Writes [;;4mBytes[0m to the file referenced by [;;4mIoDevice[0m. This function
  is the only way to write to a file opened in [;;4mraw[0m mode (although
  it works for normally opened files too). Returns [;;4mok[0m if
  successful, and [;;4m{error, Reason}[0m otherwise.

  If the file is opened with [;;4mencoding[0m set to something else than [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mlatin1[0m, each byte written can result in many bytes being written
  to the file, as the byte range 0..255 can represent anything
  between one and four bytes depending on value and UTF encoding
  type. If you want to write [;;4municode:chardata/0[0m to the [;;4mIoDevice[0m
  you should use [;;4mio:put_chars/2[0m instead.

  Typical error reasons:

   • [;;4mebadf[0m - The file is not opened for writing.

   • [;;4menospc[0m - No space is left on the device.
