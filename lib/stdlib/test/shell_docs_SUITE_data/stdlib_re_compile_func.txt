  Compiles a regular expression, with the syntax described below,
  into an internal format to be used later as a parameter to [;;4mrun/2[0m
  and [;;4mrun/3[0m.

  Compiling the regular expression before matching is useful if the
  same expression is to be used in matching against multiple
  subjects during the lifetime of the program. Compiling once and
  executing many times is far more efficient than compiling each
  time one wants to match.

  When option [;;4municode[0m is specified, the regular expression is to
  be specified as a valid Unicode [;;4mcharlist()[0m, otherwise as any
  valid [;;4miodata()[0m.

  Options:

  [;;4m[;;4municode[0m[0m:
    The regular expression is specified as a Unicode [;;4mcharlist()[0m
    and the resulting regular expression code is to be run against
    a valid Unicode [;;4mcharlist()[0m subject. Also consider option [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mucp[0m when using Unicode characters.

  [;;4m[;;4manchored[0m[0m:
    The pattern is forced to be "anchored", that is, it is
    constrained to match only at the first matching point in the
    string that is searched (the "subject string"). This effect
    can also be achieved by appropriate constructs in the pattern
    itself.

  [;;4m[;;4mcaseless[0m[0m:
    Letters in the pattern match both uppercase and lowercase
    letters. It is equivalent to Perl option [;;4m/i[0m and can be
    changed within a pattern by a [;;4m(?i)[0m option setting. Uppercase
    and lowercase letters are defined as in the ISO 8859-1
    character set.

  [;;4m[;;4mdollar_endonly[0m[0m:
    A dollar metacharacter in the pattern matches only at the end
    of the subject string. Without this option, a dollar also
    matches immediately before a newline at the end of the string
    (but not before any other newlines). This option is ignored if
    option [;;4mmultiline[0m is specified. There is no equivalent option
    in Perl, and it cannot be set within a pattern.

  [;;4m[;;4mdotall[0m[0m:
    A dot in the pattern matches all characters, including those
    indicating newline. Without it, a dot does not match when the
    current position is at a newline. This option is equivalent to
    Perl option [;;4m/s[0m and it can be changed within a pattern by a [;;4m[0m
    [;;4m(?s)[0m option setting. A negative class, such as [;;4m[^a][0m, always
    matches newline characters, independent of the setting of this
    option.

  [;;4m[;;4mextended[0m[0m:
    If this option is set, most white space characters in the
    pattern are totally ignored except when escaped or inside a
    character class. However, white space is not allowed within
    sequences such as [;;4m(?>[0m that introduce various parenthesized
    subpatterns, nor within a numerical quantifier such as [;;4m{1,3}[0m.
    However, ignorable white space is permitted between an item
    and a following quantifier and between a quantifier and a
    following + that indicates possessiveness.

    White space did not used to include the VT character (code
    11), because Perl did not treat this character as white space.
    However, Perl changed at release 5.18, so PCRE followed at
    release 8.34, and VT is now treated as white space.

    This also causes characters between an unescaped # outside a
    character class and the next newline, inclusive, to be
    ignored. This is equivalent to Perl's [;;4m/x[0m option, and it can
    be changed within a pattern by a [;;4m(?x)[0m option setting.

    With this option, comments inside complicated patterns can be
    included. However, notice that this applies only to data
    characters. Whitespace characters can never appear within
    special character sequences in a pattern, for example within
    sequence [;;4m(?([0m that introduces a conditional subpattern.

  [;;4m[;;4mfirstline[0m[0m:
    An unanchored pattern is required to match before or at the
    first newline in the subject string, although the matched text
    can continue over the newline.

  [;;4m[;;4mmultiline[0m[0m:
    By default, PCRE treats the subject string as consisting of a
    single line of characters (even if it contains newlines). The
    "start of line" metacharacter ([;;4m^[0m) matches only at the start
    of the string, while the "end of line" metacharacter ([;;4m$[0m)
    matches only at the end of the string, or before a terminating
    newline (unless option [;;4mdollar_endonly[0m is specified). This is
    the same as in Perl.

    When this option is specified, the "start of line" and "end of
    line" constructs match immediately following or immediately
    before internal newlines in the subject string, respectively,
    as well as at the very start and end. This is equivalent to
    Perl option [;;4m/m[0m and can be changed within a pattern by a [;;4m[0m
    [;;4m(?m)[0m option setting. If there are no newlines in a subject
    string, or no occurrences of [;;4m^[0m or [;;4m$[0m in a pattern, setting [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mmultiline[0m has no effect.

  [;;4m[;;4mno_auto_capture[0m[0m:
    Disables the use of numbered capturing parentheses in the
    pattern. Any opening parenthesis that is not followed by [;;4m?[0m
    behaves as if it is followed by [;;4m?:[0m. Named parentheses can
    still be used for capturing (and they acquire numbers in the
    usual way). There is no equivalent option in Perl.

  [;;4m[;;4mdupnames[0m[0m:
    Names used to identify capturing subpatterns need not be
    unique. This can be helpful for certain types of pattern when
    it is known that only one instance of the named subpattern can
    ever be matched. More details of named subpatterns are
    provided below.

  [;;4m[;;4mungreedy[0m[0m:
    Inverts the "greediness" of the quantifiers so that they are
    not greedy by default, but become greedy if followed by "?".
    It is not compatible with Perl. It can also be set by a [;;4m(?U)[0m
    option setting within the pattern.

  [;;4m[;;4m{newline, NLSpec}[0m[0m:
    Overrides the default definition of a newline in the subject
    string, which is LF (ASCII 10) in Erlang.

    [;;4m[;;4mcr[0m[0m:
      Newline is indicated by a single character [;;4mcr[0m (ASCII
      13).

    [;;4m[;;4mlf[0m[0m:
      Newline is indicated by a single character LF (ASCII 10),
      the default.

    [;;4m[;;4mcrlf[0m[0m:
      Newline is indicated by the two-character CRLF (ASCII 13
      followed by ASCII 10) sequence.

    [;;4m[;;4manycrlf[0m[0m:
      Any of the three preceding sequences is to be recognized.

    [;;4m[;;4many[0m[0m:
      Any of the newline sequences above, and the Unicode
      sequences VT (vertical tab, U+000B), FF (formfeed,
      U+000C), NEL (next line, U+0085), LS (line separator,
      U+2028), and PS (paragraph separator, U+2029).

  [;;4m[;;4mbsr_anycrlf[0m[0m:
    Specifies specifically that \R is to match only the CR, LF, or
    CRLF sequences, not the Unicode-specific newline characters.

  [;;4m[;;4mbsr_unicode[0m[0m:
    Specifies specifically that \R is to match all the Unicode
    newline characters (including CRLF, and so on, the default).

  [;;4m[;;4mno_start_optimize[0m[0m:
    Disables optimization that can malfunction if "Special
    start-of-pattern items" are present in the regular expression.
    A typical example would be when matching "DEFABC" against
    "(*COMMIT)ABC", where the start optimization of PCRE would
    skip the subject up to "A" and never realize that the
    (*COMMIT) instruction is to have made the matching fail. This
    option is only relevant if you use "start-of-pattern items",
    as discussed in section PCRE Regular Expression Details.

  [;;4m[;;4mucp[0m[0m:
    Specifies that Unicode character properties are to be used
    when resolving \B, \b, \D, \d, \S, \s, \W and \w. Without this
    flag, only ISO Latin-1 properties are used. Using Unicode
    properties hurts performance, but is semantically correct when
    working with Unicode characters beyond the ISO Latin-1 range.

  [;;4m[;;4mnever_utf[0m[0m:
    Specifies that the (*UTF) and/or (*UTF8) "start-of-pattern
    items" are forbidden. This flag cannot be combined with option [;;4m[0m
    [;;4municode[0m. Useful if ISO Latin-1 patterns from an external
    source are to be compiled.
