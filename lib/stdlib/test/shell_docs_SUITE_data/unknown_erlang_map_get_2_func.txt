  [;1m                 when Map :: map(), Key :: any(), Value :: any().[0m

[;;4mSince[0m:
  OTP 21.0

  Returns value [;;4mValue[0m associated with [;;4mKey[0m if [;;4mMap[0m contains [;;4mKey[0m.

  The call fails with a [;;4m{badmap,Map}[0m exception if [;;4mMap[0m is not a
  map, or with a [;;4m{badkey,Key}[0m exception if no value is associated
  with [;;4mKey[0m.

  Example:

    > Key = 1337,
      Map = #{42 => value_two,1337 => "value one","a" => 1},
      map_get(Key,Map).
    "value one"

  Allowed in guard tests.
