  Makes a hard link from [;;4mExisting[0m to [;;4mNew[0m on platforms supporting
  links (Unix and Windows). This function returns [;;4mok[0m if the link
  was successfully created, otherwise [;;4m{error, Reason}[0m. On
  platforms not supporting links, [;;4m{error,enotsup}[0m is returned.

  Typical error reasons:

  [;;4m[;;4meacces[0m[0m:
    Missing read or write permissions for the parent directories
    of [;;4mExisting[0m or [;;4mNew[0m.

  [;;4m[;;4meexist[0m[0m:
    [;;4mNew[0m already exists.

  [;;4m[;;4menotsup[0m[0m:
    Hard links are not supported on this platform.
