[;1m  script(Filename)[0m

  Reads and evaluates Erlang expressions, separated by [;;4m.[0m (or [;;4m,[0m,
  a sequence of expressions is also an expression), from the file.

  Returns one of the following:

   • [;;4m{ok, Value}[0m - The file is read and evaluated. [;;4mValue[0m is
     the value of the last expression.

   • [;;4m{error, atom()}[0m - An error occurred when opening the file
     or reading it. For a list of typical error codes, see [;;4m[0m
     [;;4mopen/2[0m.

   • [;;4m{error, {Line, Mod, Term}}[0m - An error occurred when
     interpreting the Erlang expressions in the file. Use [;;4m[0m
     [;;4mformat_error/1[0m to convert the three-element tuple to an
     English description of the error.

  The encoding of [;;4mFilename[0m can be set by a comment as described in [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mepp[0m.

[;1m  script(Filename, Bindings)[0m

  used in the evaluation. See [;;4merl_eval[0m about variable bindings.
