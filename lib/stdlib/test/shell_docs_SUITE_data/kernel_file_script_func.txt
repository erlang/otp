  Reads and evaluates Erlang expressions, separated by '.' (or ',',
  a sequence of expressions is also an expression), from the file.

  Returns one of the following:

  [;;4m[;;4m{ok, Value}[0m[0m:
    The file is read and evaluated. [;;4mValue[0m is the value of the
    last expression.

  [;;4m[;;4m{error, atom()}[0m[0m:
    An error occurred when opening the file or reading it. For a
    list of typical error codes, see [;;4mopen/2[0m.

  [;;4m[;;4m{error, {Line, Mod, Term}}[0m[0m:
    An error occurred when interpreting the Erlang expressions in
    the file. Use [;;4mformat_error/1[0m to convert the three-element
    tuple to an English description of the error.

  The encoding of [;;4mFilename[0m can be set by a comment as described in [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mepp(3)[0m.

  The same as [;;4mscript/1[0m but the variable bindings [;;4mBindings[0m are
  used in the evaluation. See [;;4merl_eval(3)[0m about variable bindings.
