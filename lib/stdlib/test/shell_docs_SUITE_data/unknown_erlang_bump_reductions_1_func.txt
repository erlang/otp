  [;1m                                when Reductions :: pos_integer().[0m

  This implementation-dependent function increments the reduction
  counter for the calling process. In the Beam emulator, the
  reduction counter is normally incremented by one for each function
  and BIF call. A context switch is forced when the counter reaches
  the maximum number of reductions for a process (4000 reductions in
  Erlang/OTP 19.2 and later).

  Warning:
    This BIF can be removed in a future version of the Beam
    machine without prior warning. It is unlikely to be
    implemented in other Erlang implementations.
