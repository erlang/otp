  Types:
    -type priority_level() :: low | normal | high | max.

  Sets the process priority. [;;4mLevel[0m is an atom. Four priority
  levels exist: [;;4mlow[0m, [;;4mnormal[0m, [;;4mhigh[0m, and [;;4mmax[0m. Default is [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mnormal[0m.

  Note:
    Priority level [;;4mmax[0m is reserved for internal use in the
    Erlang runtime system, and is not to be used by others.

  Internally in each priority level, processes are scheduled in a
  round robin fashion.

  Execution of processes on priority [;;4mnormal[0m and [;;4mlow[0m are
  interleaved. Processes on priority [;;4mlow[0m are selected for
  execution less frequently than processes on priority [;;4mnormal[0m.

  When runnable processes on priority [;;4mhigh[0m exist, no processes on
  priority [;;4mlow[0m or [;;4mnormal[0m are selected for execution. Notice
  however that this does not mean that no processes on priority [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mlow[0m or [;;4mnormal[0m can run when processes are running on priority [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mhigh[0m. When using multiple schedulers, more processes can be
  running in parallel than processes on priority [;;4mhigh[0m. That is, a [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mlow[0m and a [;;4mhigh[0m priority process can execute at the same time.

  When runnable processes on priority [;;4mmax[0m exist, no processes on
  priority [;;4mlow[0m, [;;4mnormal[0m, or [;;4mhigh[0m are selected for execution. As
  with priority [;;4mhigh[0m, processes on lower priorities can execute in
  parallel with processes on priority [;;4mmax[0m.

  Scheduling is pre-emptive. Regardless of priority, a process is
  pre-empted when it has consumed more than a certain number of
  reductions since the last time it was selected for execution.

  Note:
    Do not depend on the scheduling to remain exactly as it is
    today. Scheduling is likely to be changed in a future release
    to use available processor cores better.

  There is no automatic mechanism for avoiding priority inversion,
  such as priority inheritance or priority ceilings. When using
  priorities, take this into account and handle such scenarios by
  yourself.

  Making calls from a [;;4mhigh[0m priority process into code that you has
  no control over can cause the [;;4mhigh[0m priority process to wait for
  a process with lower priority. That is, effectively decreasing the
  priority of the [;;4mhigh[0m priority process during the call. Even if
  this is not the case with one version of the code that you have no
  control over, it can be the case in a future version of it. This
  can, for example, occur if a [;;4mhigh[0m priority process triggers code
  loading, as the code server runs on priority [;;4mnormal[0m.

  Other priorities than [;;4mnormal[0m are normally not needed. When other
  priorities are used, use them with care, especially priority [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mhigh[0m. A process on priority [;;4mhigh[0m is only to perform work for
  short periods. Busy looping for long periods in a [;;4mhigh[0m priority
  process causes most likely problems, as important OTP servers run
  on priority [;;4mnormal[0m.

  Returns the old value of the flag.
