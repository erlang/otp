  [;1m-spec term_to_binary(Term) -> ext_binary() when Term :: term().[0m

  Returns a binary data object that is the result of encoding [;;4mTerm[0m
  according to the Erlang external term format.

  This can be used for various purposes, for example, writing a term
  to a file in an efficient way, or sending an Erlang term to some
  type of communications channel not supported by distributed
  Erlang.

    > Bin = term_to_binary(hello).
    <<131,100,0,5,104,101,108,108,111>>
    > hello = binary_to_term(Bin).
    hello

    encoded representation for the same term.
