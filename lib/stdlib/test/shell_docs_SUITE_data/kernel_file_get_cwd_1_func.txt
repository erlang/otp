  [;1m                     Reason :: posix() | badarg.[0m

  Returns [;;4m{ok, Dir}[0m or [;;4m{error, Reason}[0m, where [;;4mDir[0m is the
  current working directory of the specified drive.

  [;;4mDrive[0m is to be of the form "[;;4mLetter[0m[;;4m:[0m", for example, "c:".

  Returns [;;4m{error, enotsup}[0m on platforms that have no concept of
  current drive (Unix, for example).

  Typical error reasons:

  [;;4m[;;4menotsup[0m[0m:
    The operating system has no concept of drives.

  [;;4m[;;4meacces[0m[0m:
    The drive does not exist.

  [;;4m[;;4meinval[0m[0m:
    The format of [;;4mDrive[0m is invalid.
