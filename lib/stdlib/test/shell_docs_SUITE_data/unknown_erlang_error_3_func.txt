[;1m  error(Reason, Args, Options)[0m

[;;4mSince[0m:
  OTP 24.0

  Raises an exception of class [;;4merror[0m with the reason [;;4mReason[0m. [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mArgs[0m is expected to be the list of arguments for the current
  function or the atom [;;4mnone[0m.

  If [;;4mArgs[0m is a list, it is used to provide the arguments for the
  current function in the stack back-trace. If it is [;;4mnone[0m, the
  arity of the calling function is used in the stacktrace. As
  evaluating this function causes an exception to be raised, it has
  no return value.

  If the [;;4merror_info[0m option is given, the [;;4mErrorInfoMap[0m will be
  inserted into the stacktrace. The information given in the [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mErrorInfoMap[0m is to be used by error formatters such as [;;4merl_error[0m
  to provide more context around an error.

  The default [;;4mmodule[0m of the [;;4mErrorInfoMap[0m is the module that the
  call to [;;4merror/3[0m is made. The default [;;4mfunction[0m is [;;4mformat_error[0m.
  See [;;4mformat_error/2[0m for more details on how this
  Module:Function/2 is to be used

  The intent of the exception class [;;4merror[0m is to signal that an
  unexpected error has happened (for example, a function is called
  with a parameter that has an incorrect type). See the guide about
  errors and error handling for additional information.
