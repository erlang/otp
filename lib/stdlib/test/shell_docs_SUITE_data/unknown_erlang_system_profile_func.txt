  Sets system profiler options. [;;4mProfilerPid[0m is a local process
  identifier (pid) or port receiving profiling messages. The
  receiver is excluded from all profiling. The second argument is a
  list of profiling options:

  [;;4m[;;4mexclusive[0m[0m:
    If a synchronous call to a port from a process is done, the
    calling process is considered not runnable during the call
    runtime to the port. The calling process is notified as [;;4m[0m
    [;;4minactive[0m, and later [;;4mactive[0m when the port callback returns.

  [;;4m[;;4mmonotonic_timestamp[0m[0m:
    Time stamps in profile messages use Erlang monotonic time.
    The time stamp (Ts) has the same format and value as produced
    by [;;4merlang:monotonic_time(nanosecond)[0m.

  [;;4m[;;4mrunnable_procs[0m[0m:
    If a process is put into or removed from the run queue, a
    message, [;;4m{profile, Pid, State, Mfa, Ts}[0m, is sent to [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mProfilerPid[0m. Running processes that are reinserted into the
    run queue after having been pre-empted do not trigger this
    message.

  [;;4m[;;4mrunnable_ports[0m[0m:
    If a port is put into or removed from the run queue, a
    message, [;;4m{profile, Port, State, 0, Ts}[0m, is sent to [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mProfilerPid[0m.

  [;;4m[;;4mscheduler[0m[0m:
    If a scheduler is put to sleep or awoken, a message, [;;4m[0m
    [;;4m{profile, scheduler, Id, State, NoScheds, Ts}[0m, is sent to [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mProfilerPid[0m.

  [;;4m[;;4mstrict_monotonic_timestamp[0m[0m:
    Time stamps in profile messages consist of Erlang monotonic
    time and a monotonically increasing integer. The time stamp
    (Ts) has the same format and value as produced by [;;4m[0m
    [;;4m{erlang:monotonic_time(nanosecond),[0m
    [;;4merlang:unique_integer([monotonic])}[0m.

  [;;4m[;;4mtimestamp[0m[0m:
    Time stamps in profile messages include a time stamp (Ts) that
    has the same form as returned by [;;4merlang:now()[0m. This is also
    the default if no time stamp flag is specified. If [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mcpu_timestamp[0m has been enabled through [;;4merlang:trace/3[0m, this
    also effects the time stamp produced in profiling messages
    when flag [;;4mtimestamp[0m is enabled.

  Note:
    [;;4merlang:system_profile[0m behavior can change in a future
    release.
