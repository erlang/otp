  Returns a port identifier as the result of opening a new Erlang
  port. A port can be seen as an external Erlang process.

  The name of the executable as well as the arguments specified in [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mcd[0m, [;;4menv[0m, [;;4margs[0m, and [;;4marg0[0m are subject to Unicode filename
  translation if the system is running in Unicode filename mode. To
  avoid translation or to force, for example UTF-8, supply the
  executable and/or arguments as a binary in the correct encoding.
  For details, see the module [;;4mfile(3)[0m, the function [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mfile:native_name_encoding/0[0m in Kernel, and the [;;4mUsing Unicode in[0m
  [;;4mErlang[0m User's Guide.

  Note:
    The characters in the name (if specified as a list) can only
    be > 255 if the Erlang virtual machine is started in Unicode
    filename translation mode. Otherwise the name of the
    executable is limited to the ISO Latin-1 character set.

  [;;4mPortName[0ms:

  [;;4m[;;4m{spawn, Command}[0m[0m:
    Starts an external program. [;;4mCommand[0m is the name of the
    external program to be run. [;;4mCommand[0m runs outside the Erlang
    work space unless an Erlang driver with the name [;;4mCommand[0m is
    found. If found, that driver is started. A driver runs in the
    Erlang work space, which means that it is linked with the
    Erlang runtime system.

    For external programs, [;;4mPATH[0m is searched (or an equivalent
    method is used to find programs, depending on the OS). This is
    done by invoking the shell on certain platforms. The first
    space-separated token of the command is considered as the name
    of the executable (or driver). This (among other things) makes
    this option unsuitable for running programs with spaces in
    filenames or directory names. If spaces in executable
    filenames are desired, use [;;4m{spawn_executable, Command}[0m
    instead.

  [;;4m[;;4m{spawn_driver, Command}[0m[0m:
    Works like [;;4m{spawn, Command}[0m, but demands the first
    (space-separated) token of the command to be the name of a
    loaded driver. If no driver with that name is loaded, a [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mbadarg[0m error is raised.

  [;;4m[;;4m{spawn_executable, FileName}[0m[0m:
    Works like [;;4m{spawn, FileName}[0m, but only runs external
    executables. [;;4mFileName[0m in its whole is used as the name of
    the executable, including any spaces. If arguments are to be
    passed, the [;;4mPortSettings[0m [;;4margs[0m and [;;4marg0[0m can be used.

    The shell is usually not invoked to start the program, it is
    executed directly. [;;4mPATH[0m (or equivalent) is not searched. To
    find a program in [;;4mPATH[0m to execute, use [;;4mos:find_executable/1[0m.

    Only if a shell script or [;;4m.bat[0m file is executed, the
    appropriate command interpreter is invoked implicitly, but
    there is still no command-argument expansion or implicit [;;4mPATH[0m
    search.

    If [;;4mFileName[0m cannot be run, an error exception is raised,
    with the POSIX error code as the reason. The error reason can
    differ between OSs. Typically the error [;;4menoent[0m is raised
    when an attempt is made to run a program that is not found and [;;4m[0m
    [;;4meacces[0m is raised when the specified file is not executable.

  [;;4m[;;4m{fd, In, Out}[0m[0m:
    Allows an Erlang process to access any currently opened file
    descriptors used by Erlang. The file descriptor [;;4mIn[0m can be
    used for standard input, and the file descriptor [;;4mOut[0m for
    standard output. It is only used for various servers in the
    Erlang OS ([;;4mshell[0m and [;;4muser[0m). Hence, its use is limited.

  [;;4mPortSettings[0m is a list of settings for the port. The valid
  settings are as follows:

  [;;4m[;;4m{packet, N}[0m[0m:
    Messages are preceded by their length, sent in [;;4mN[0m bytes, with
    the most significant byte first. The valid values for [;;4mN[0m are
    1, 2, and 4.

  [;;4m[;;4mstream[0m[0m:
    Output messages are sent without packet lengths. A
    user-defined protocol must be used between the Erlang process
    and the external object.

  [;;4m[;;4m{line, L}[0m[0m:
    Messages are delivered on a per line basis. Each line
    (delimited by the OS-dependent newline sequence) is delivered
    in a single message. The message data format is [;;4m{Flag, Line}[0m,
    where [;;4mFlag[0m is [;;4meol[0m or [;;4mnoeol[0m, and [;;4mLine[0m is the data
    delivered (without the newline sequence).

    [;;4mL[0m specifies the maximum line length in bytes. Lines longer
    than this are delivered in more than one message, with [;;4mFlag[0m
    set to [;;4mnoeol[0m for all but the last message. If end of file is
    encountered anywhere else than immediately following a newline
    sequence, the last line is also delivered with [;;4mFlag[0m set to [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mnoeol[0m. Otherwise lines are delivered with [;;4mFlag[0m set to [;;4meol[0m.

    The [;;4m{packet, N}[0m and [;;4m{line, L}[0m settings are mutually
    exclusive.

  [;;4m[;;4m{cd, Dir}[0m[0m:
    Only valid for [;;4m{spawn, Command}[0m and [;;4m{spawn_executable,[0m
    [;;4mFileName}[0m. The external program starts using [;;4mDir[0m as its
    working directory. [;;4mDir[0m must be a string.

  [;;4m[;;4m{env, Env}[0m[0m:
    Types:
      [;;4mName = [0m[;;4mos:env_var_name()[0m
      [;;4mVal = [0m[;;4mos:env_var_value()[0m[;;4m | false[0m
      [;;4mEnv = [{Name, Val}][0m

    Only valid for [;;4m{spawn, Command}[0m, and [;;4m{spawn_executable,[0m
    [;;4mFileName}[0m. The environment of the started process is extended
    using the environment specifications in [;;4mEnv[0m.

    [;;4mEnv[0m is to be a list of tuples [;;4m{Name, Val}[0m, where [;;4mName[0m is
    the name of an environment variable, and [;;4mVal[0m is the value it
    is to have in the spawned port process. Both [;;4mName[0m and [;;4mVal[0m
    must be strings. The one exception is [;;4mVal[0m being the atom [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mfalse[0m (in analogy with [;;4mos:getenv/1[0m), which removes the
    environment variable.

    For information about encoding requirements, see documentation
    of the types for [;;4mName[0m and [;;4mVal[0m.

  [;;4m[;;4m{args, [ string() | binary() ]}[0m[0m:
    Only valid for [;;4m{spawn_executable, FileName}[0m and specifies
    arguments to the executable. Each argument is specified as a
    separate string and (on Unix) eventually ends up as one
    element each in the argument vector. On other platforms, a
    similar behavior is mimicked.

    The arguments are not expanded by the shell before they are
    supplied to the executable. Most notably this means that file
    wildcard expansion does not occur. To expand wildcards for the
    arguments, use [;;4mfilelib:wildcard/1[0m. Notice that even if the
    program is a Unix shell script, meaning that the shell
    ultimately is invoked, wildcard expansion does not occur, and
    the script is provided with the untouched arguments. On
    Windows, wildcard expansion is always up to the program
    itself, therefore this is not an issue.

    The executable name (also known as [;;4margv[0][0m) is not to be
    specified in this list. The proper executable name is
    automatically used as [;;4margv[0][0m, where applicable.

    If you explicitly want to set the program name in the argument
    vector, option [;;4marg0[0m can be used.

  [;;4m[;;4m{arg0, string() | binary()}[0m[0m:
    Only valid for [;;4m{spawn_executable, FileName}[0m and explicitly
    specifies the program name argument when running an
    executable. This can in some circumstances, on some OSs, be
    desirable. How the program responds to this is highly
    system-dependent and no specific effect is guaranteed.

  [;;4m[;;4mexit_status[0m[0m:
    Only valid for [;;4m{spawn, Command}[0m, where [;;4mCommand[0m refers to
    an external program, and for [;;4m{spawn_executable, FileName}[0m.

    When the external process connected to the port exits, a
    message of the form [;;4m{Port,{exit_status,Status}}[0m is sent to
    the connected process, where [;;4mStatus[0m is the exit status of
    the external process. If the program aborts on Unix, the same
    convention is used as the shells do (that is, 128+signal).

    If option [;;4meof[0m is specified also, the messages [;;4meof[0m and [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mexit_status[0m appear in an unspecified order.

    If the port program closes its [;;4mstdout[0m without exiting,
    option [;;4mexit_status[0m does not work.

  [;;4m[;;4muse_stdio[0m[0m:
    Only valid for [;;4m{spawn, Command}[0m and [;;4m{spawn_executable,[0m
    [;;4mFileName}[0m. It allows the standard input and output (file
    descriptors 0 and 1) of the spawned (Unix) process for
    communication with Erlang.

  [;;4m[;;4mnouse_stdio[0m[0m:
    The opposite of [;;4muse_stdio[0m. It uses file descriptors 3 and 4
    for communication with Erlang.

  [;;4m[;;4mstderr_to_stdout[0m[0m:
    Affects ports to external programs. The executed program gets
    its standard error file redirected to its standard output
    file. [;;4mstderr_to_stdout[0m and [;;4mnouse_stdio[0m are mutually
    exclusive.

  [;;4m[;;4moverlapped_io[0m[0m:
    Affects ports to external programs on Windows only. The
    standard input and standard output handles of the port program
    are, if this option is supplied, opened with flag [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mFILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED[0m, so that the port program can (and must)
    do overlapped I/O on its standard handles. This is not
    normally the case for simple port programs, but an option of
    value for the experienced Windows programmer. On all other
    platforms, this option is silently discarded.

  [;;4m[;;4min[0m[0m:
    The port can only be used for input.

  [;;4m[;;4mout[0m[0m:
    The port can only be used for output.

  [;;4m[;;4mbinary[0m[0m:
    All I/O from the port is binary data objects as opposed to
    lists of bytes.

  [;;4m[;;4meof[0m[0m:
    The port is not closed at the end of the file and does not
    produce an exit signal. Instead, it remains open and a [;;4m{Port,[0m
    [;;4meof}[0m message is sent to the process holding the port.

  [;;4m[;;4mhide[0m[0m:
    When running on Windows, suppresses creation of a new console
    window when spawning the port program. (This option has no
    effect on other platforms.)

  [;;4m[;;4m{parallelism, Boolean}[0m[0m:
    Sets scheduler hint for port parallelism. If set to [;;4mtrue[0m,
    the virtual machine schedules port tasks; when doing so, it
    improves parallelism in the system. If set to [;;4mfalse[0m, the
    virtual machine tries to perform port tasks immediately,
    improving latency at the expense of parallelism. The default
    can be set at system startup by passing command-line argument [;;4m[0m
    [;;4m+spp[0m to [;;4merl(1)[0m.

  [;;4m[;;4m{busy_limits_port, {Low, High} | disabled}[0m[0m:
    Sets limits that will be used for controlling the busy state
    of the port.

    When the ports internal output queue size becomes larger than
    or equal to [;;4mHigh[0m bytes, it enters the busy state. When it
    becomes less than [;;4mLow[0m bytes it leaves the busy state. When
    the port is in the busy state, processes sending commands to
    it will be suspended until the port leaves the busy state.
    Commands are in this context either [;;4mPort ! {Owner, {command,[0m
    [;;4mData}}[0m or [;;4mport_command/[2,3][0m.

    The [;;4mLow[0m limit is automatically adjusted to the same as [;;4mHigh[0m
    if it is set larger then [;;4mHigh[0m. Valid range of values for [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mLow[0m and [;;4mHigh[0m is [;;4m[1, (1 bsl[0m
    [;;4m(8*erlang:system_info(wordsize)))-2][0m. If the atom [;;4mdisabled[0m
    is passed, the port will never enter the busy state.

    The defaults are [;;4mLow = 4096[0m and [;;4mHigh = 8192[0m.

    Note that this option is only valid when spawning an
    executable (port program) by opening the spawn driver and when
    opening the [;;4mfd[0m driver. This option will cause a failure with
    a [;;4mbadarg[0m exception when opening other drivers.

  [;;4m[;;4m{busy_limits_msgq, {Low, High} | disabled}[0m[0m:
    Sets limits that will be used for controlling the busy state
    of the port message queue.

    When the ports message queue size becomes larger than or equal
    to [;;4mHigh[0m bytes it enters the busy state. When it becomes less
    than [;;4mLow[0m bytes it leaves the busy state. When the port
    message queue is in the busy state, processes sending commands
    to it will be suspended until the port message queue leaves
    the busy state. Commands are in this context either [;;4mPort ![0m
    [;;4m{Owner, {command, Data}}[0m or [;;4mport_command/[2,3][0m.

    The [;;4mLow[0m limit is automatically adjusted to the same as [;;4mHigh[0m
    if it is set larger then [;;4mHigh[0m. Valid range of values for [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mLow[0m and [;;4mHigh[0m is [;;4m[1, (1 bsl[0m
    [;;4m(8*erlang:system_info(wordsize)))-2][0m. If the atom [;;4mdisabled[0m
    is passed, the port message queue will never enter the busy
    state.

    Note that if the driver statically has disabled the use of
    this feature, a failure with a [;;4mbadarg[0m exception will be
    raised unless this option also is set to [;;4mdisable[0m or not
    passed at all.

    The defaults are [;;4mLow = 4096[0m and [;;4mHigh = 8192[0m unless the
    driver itself does modifications of these values.

    Note that the driver might fail if it also adjust these
    limits by itself and you have disabled this feature.

    The spawn driver (used when spawning an executable) and the [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mfd[0m driver do not disable this feature and do not adjust these
    limits by themselves.

    For more information see the documentation [;;4m[0m
    [;;4merl_drv_busy_msgq_limits()[0m.

  Default is [;;4mstream[0m for all port types and [;;4muse_stdio[0m for spawned
  ports.

  Failure: if the port cannot be opened, the exit reason is [;;4mbadarg[0m, [;;4m[0m
  [;;4msystem_limit[0m, or the POSIX error code that most closely describes
  the error, or [;;4meinval[0m if no POSIX code is appropriate:

  [;;4m[;;4mbadarg[0m[0m:
    Bad input arguments to [;;4mopen_port[0m.

  [;;4m[;;4msystem_limit[0m[0m:
    All available ports in the Erlang emulator are in use.

  [;;4m[;;4menomem[0m[0m:
    Not enough memory to create the port.

  [;;4m[;;4meagain[0m[0m:
    No more available OS processes.

  [;;4m[;;4menametoolong[0m[0m:
    Too long external command.

  [;;4m[;;4memfile[0m[0m:
    No more available file descriptors (for the OS process that
    the Erlang emulator runs in).

  [;;4m[;;4menfile[0m[0m:
    Full file table (for the entire OS).

  [;;4m[;;4meacces[0m[0m:
    [;;4mCommand[0m specified in [;;4m{spawn_executable, Command}[0m does not
    point out an executable file.

  [;;4m[;;4menoent[0m[0m:
    [;;4mFileName[0m specified in [;;4m{spawn_executable, FileName}[0m does not
    point out an existing file.

  During use of a port opened using [;;4m{spawn, Name}[0m, [;;4m{spawn_driver,[0m
  [;;4mName}[0m, or [;;4m{spawn_executable, Name}[0m, errors arising when sending
  messages to it are reported to the owning process using signals of
  the form [;;4m{'EXIT', Port, PosixCode}[0m. For the possible values of [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mPosixCode[0m, see [;;4mfile(3)[0m.

  The maximum number of ports that can be open at the same time can
  be configured by passing command-line flag [;;4m+Q[0m to [;;4merl(1)[0m.
