  [;1m                      when Family1 :: family(), Family2 :: family().[0m

  If [;;4mFamily1[0m is a family and [;;4mFamily1[0m[i] is a binary relation
  for every i in the index set of [;;4mFamily1[0m, then [;;4mFamily2[0m is the
  family with the same index set as [;;4mFamily1[0m such that [;;4mFamily2[0m[i]
  is the field of [;;4mFamily1[0m[i].

  [;;4mfamily_field(Family1)[0m is equivalent to [;;4m[0m
