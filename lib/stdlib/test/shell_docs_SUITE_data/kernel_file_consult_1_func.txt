  Reads Erlang terms, separated by '.', from [;;4mFilename[0m. Returns one
  of the following:

  [;;4m[;;4m{ok, Terms}[0m[0m:
    The file was successfully read.

  [;;4m[;;4m{error, atom()}[0m[0m:
    An error occurred when opening the file or reading it. For a
    list of typical error codes, see [;;4mopen/2[0m.

  [;;4m[;;4m{error, {Line, Mod, Term}}[0m[0m:
    An error occurred when interpreting the Erlang terms in the
    file. To convert the three-element tuple to an English
    description of the error, use [;;4mformat_error/1[0m.

  Example:

    f.txt:  {person, "kalle", 25}.
            {person, "pelle", 30}.

    1> file:consult("f.txt").
    {ok,[{person,"kalle",25},{person,"pelle",30}]}

  The encoding of [;;4mFilename[0m can be set by a comment, as described
  in [;;4mepp(3)[0m.
