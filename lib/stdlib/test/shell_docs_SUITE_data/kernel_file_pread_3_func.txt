[;1m  pread(IoDevice, Location, Number)[0m

  Combines [;;4mposition/2[0m and [;;4mread/2[0m in one operation, which is more
  efficient than calling them one at a time.

  [;;4mLocation[0m is only allowed to be an integer for [;;4mraw[0m and [;;4mram[0m
  modes.

  The current position of the file after the operation is undefined
  for [;;4mraw[0m mode and unchanged for [;;4mram[0m mode.

  As the position is specified as a byte-offset, take special
  caution when working with files where [;;4mencoding[0m is set to
  something else than [;;4mlatin1[0m, as not every byte position is a
  valid character boundary on such a file.
