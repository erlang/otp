  [;1m-spec exit(Reason) -> no_return() when Reason :: term().[0m

  Raises an exception of class [;;4mexit[0m with exit reason [;;4mReason[0m. As
  evaluating this function causes an exception to be raised, it has
  no return value.

  The intent of the exception class [;;4mexit[0m is that the current
  process should be stopped (for example when a message telling a
  process to stop is received).

  This function differ from [;;4merror/1,2,3[0m by causing an exception of
  a different class and by having a reason that does not include the
  list of functions from the call stack.

  See the guide about errors and error handling for additional
  information.

  Example:

    > exit(foobar).
    ** exception exit: foobar
    > catch exit(foobar).
    {'EXIT',foobar}

  Note:
    If a process calls [;;4mexit(kill)[0m and does not catch the
    exception, it will terminate with exit reason [;;4mkill[0m and also
    emit exit signals with exit reason [;;4mkill[0m (not [;;4mkilled[0m) to
    all linked processes. Such exit signals with exit reason [;;4mkill[0m
    can be trapped by the linked processes. Note that this means
    that signals with exit reason [;;4mkill[0m behave differently
    depending on how they are sent because the signal will be
    untrappable if a process sends such a signal to another
    process with [;;4merlang:exit/2[0m.
