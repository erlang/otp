  [;1m                            when Fun :: function().[0m

  Returns [;;4mString[0m that represents the code that created [;;4mFun[0m.

  [;;4mString[0m has the following form, if [;;4mFun[0m was created by a fun
  expression of the form [;;4mfun ModuleName:FuncName/Arity[0m:

  [;;4m"fun ModuleName:FuncName/Arity"[0m

  The form of [;;4mString[0m when [;;4mFun[0m is created from other types of 
  fun expressions differs depending on if the fun expression was
  executed while executing compiled code or if the fun expression
  was executed while executing uncompiled code (uncompiled escripts,
  the Erlang shell, and other code executed by the erl_eval module):

  [;;4mcompiled code[0m:
    [;;4m"#Fun<M.I.U>"[0m, where M, I and U correspond to the values
    named [;;4mmodule[0m, [;;4mindex[0m and [;;4muniq[0m in the result of [;;4m[0m
    [;;4merlang:fun_info(Fun)[0m.

  [;;4muncompiled code[0m:
    All funs created from fun expressions in uncompiled code with
    the same arity are mapped to the same list by [;;4mfun_to_list/1[0m.

  Note:
    Generally, one can not use [;;4mfun_to_list/1[0m to check if two
    funs are equal as [;;4mfun_to_list/1[0m does not take the fun's
    environment into account. See [;;4merlang:fun_info/1[0m for how to
    get the environment of a fun.

  Change:
    The output of [;;4mfun_to_list/1[0m can differ between Erlang
    implementations and may change in future versions.

  Examples:

    -module(test).
    -export([add/1, add2/0, fun_tuple/0]).
    add(A) -> fun(B) -> A + B end.
    add2() -> fun add/1.
    fun_tuple() -> {fun() -> 1 end, fun() -> 1 end}.

    > {fun test:add/1, test:add2()}.
    {fun test:add/1,#Fun<test.1.107738983>}

  Explanation: [;;4mfun test:add/1[0m is upgradable but [;;4mtest:add2()[0m is
  not upgradable.

    > {test:add(1), test:add(42)}.
    {#Fun<test.0.107738983>,#Fun<test.0.107738983>}

  Explanation: [;;4mtest:add(1)[0m and [;;4mtest:add(42)[0m has the same string
  representation as the environment is not taken into account.

    >test:fun_tuple().
    {#Fun<test.2.107738983>,#Fun<test.3.107738983>}

  Explanation: The string representations differ because the funs
  come from different fun expressions.

    > {fun() -> 1 end, fun() -> 1 end}. > 
    {#Fun<erl_eval.45.97283095>,#Fun<erl_eval.45.97283095>}

  Explanation: All funs created from fun expressions of this form in
  uncompiled code with the same arity are mapped to the same list by [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mfun_to_list/1[0m.
