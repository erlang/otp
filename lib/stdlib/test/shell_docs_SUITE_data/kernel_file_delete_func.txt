[;1m  delete(Filename)[0m

  There is no documentation for delete(Filename, [])

[;1m  delete(Filename, Opts)[0m

[;;4mSince[0m:
  OTP 24.0

  Tries to delete file [;;4mFilename[0m. Returns [;;4mok[0m if successful.

  If the option [;;4mraw[0m is set, the file server is not called. This
  can be useful in particular during the early boot stage when the
  file server is not yet registered, to still be able to delete
  local files.

  Typical error reasons:

   • [;;4menoent[0m - The file does not exist.

   • [;;4meacces[0m - Missing permission for the file or one of its
     parents.

   • [;;4meperm[0m - The file is a directory and the user is not
     superuser.

   • [;;4menotdir[0m - A component of the filename is not a directory.
     On some platforms, [;;4menoent[0m is returned instead.

   • [;;4meinval[0m - [;;4mFilename[0m has an improper type, such as tuple.

  [;;4mWarning[0m

    In a future release, a bad type for argument [;;4mFilename[0m will
    probably generate an exception.
