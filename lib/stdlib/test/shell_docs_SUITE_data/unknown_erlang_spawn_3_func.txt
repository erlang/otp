  Returns the process identifier of a new process started by the
  application of [;;4mModule:Function[0m to [;;4mArgs[0m.

  [;;4merror_handler:undefined_function(Module, Function, Args)[0m is
  evaluated by the new process if [;;4mModule:Function/Arity[0m does not
  exist (where [;;4mArity[0m is the length of [;;4mArgs[0m). The error handler
  can be redefined (see [;;4mprocess_flag/2[0m). If [;;4merror_handler[0m is
  undefined, or the user has redefined the default [;;4merror_handler[0m
  and its replacement is undefined, a failure with reason [;;4mundef[0m
  occurs.

  Example:

    > spawn(speed, regulator, [high_speed, thin_cut]).
    <0.13.1>
