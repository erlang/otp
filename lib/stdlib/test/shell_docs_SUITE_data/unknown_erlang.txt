  By convention, most Built-In Functions (BIFs) and all predefined
  types are included in this module. Some of the BIFs and all of the
  predefined types are viewed more or less as part of the Erlang
  programming language and are auto-imported. Thus, it is not
  necessary to specify the module name. For example, the calls [;;4m[0m
  [;;4matom_to_list(erlang)[0m and [;;4merlang:atom_to_list(erlang)[0m are
  identical.

  Auto-imported BIFs are listed without module prefix. BIFs listed
  with module prefix are not auto-imported.

  Predefined types are listed in the Predefined datatypes section
  of this reference manual and in the Types and Function
  Specifications section of the Erlang Reference Manual.

  BIFs can fail for various reasons. All BIFs fail with reason [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mbadarg[0m if they are called with arguments of an incorrect type.
  The other reasons are described in the description of each
  individual BIF.

  Some BIFs can be used in guard tests and are marked with "Allowed
  in guard tests".
