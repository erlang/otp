[;1m  time_offset()[0m

[;;4mSince[0m:
  OTP 18.0

  Returns the current time offset between Erlang monotonic time and
  Erlang system time in [;;4mnative[0m time unit. Current time offset
  added to an Erlang monotonic time gives corresponding Erlang
  system time.

  The time offset may or may not change during operation depending
  on the time warp mode used.

  [;;4mNote[0m

    A change in time offset can be observed at slightly different
    points in time by different processes. If the runtime system
    is in multi-time warp mode, the time offset is changed when
    the runtime system detects that the OS system time has
    changed. The runtime system will, however, not detect this
    immediately when it occurs. A task checking the time offset is
    scheduled to execute at least once a minute; so, under normal
    operation this is to be detected within a minute, but during
    heavy load it can take longer time.
