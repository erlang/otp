[;;4mSince[0m:
  OTP 18.0

  Returns the current time offset between Erlang monotonic time
  and Erlang system time in [;;4mnative[0m time unit. Current time
  offset added to an Erlang monotonic time gives corresponding
  Erlang system time.

  The time offset may or may not change during operation depending
  on the time warp mode used.

  Note:
    A change in time offset can be observed at slightly different
    points in time by different processes.

    If the runtime system is in multi-time warp mode, the time
    offset is changed when the runtime system detects that the OS
    system time has changed. The runtime system will, however,
    not detect this immediately when it occurs. A task checking
    the time offset is scheduled to execute at least once a
    minute; so, under normal operation this is to be detected
    within a minute, but during heavy load it can take longer
    time.
