  [;1m                       when Term :: term(), Hash :: non_neg_integer().[0m

  Portable hash function that gives the same hash for the same
  Erlang term regardless of machine architecture and ERTS version
  (the BIF was introduced in ERTS 5.2). The function returns a hash
  value for [;;4mTerm[0m within the range [;;4m0..Range-1[0m. The maximum value
  for [;;4mRange[0m is 2^32. When without argument [;;4mRange[0m, a value in the
  range 0..2^27-1 is returned.

  This BIF is always to be used for hashing terms. It distributes
  small integers better than [;;4mphash/2[0m, and it is faster for bignums
  and binaries.

  Notice that the range [;;4m0..Range-1[0m is different from the range of [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mphash/2[0m, which is [;;4m1..Range[0m.
