  [;1m-spec min(Term1, Term2) -> Minimum[0m
  [;1m             when Term1 :: term(), Term2 :: term(), Minimum :: term().[0m

  Returns the smallest of [;;4mTerm1[0m and [;;4mTerm2[0m. If the terms compare
  equal with the [;;4m==[0m operator, [;;4mTerm1[0m is returned.

  The Expressions section contains descriptions of the [;;4m==[0m
  operator and how terms are ordered.

  Examples:

    > min(1, 2).
    1

    > min(1.0, 1).
    1.0

    > min(1, 1.0).
    1

    > min("abc", "b").
    "abc"
