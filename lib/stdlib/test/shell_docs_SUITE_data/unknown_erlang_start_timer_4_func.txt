  Starts a timer. When the timer expires, the message [;;4m{timeout,[0m
  [;;4mTimerRef, Msg}[0m is sent to the process identified by [;;4mDest[0m.

  [;;4mOption[0ms:

  [;;4m[;;4m{abs, false}[0m[0m:
    This is the default. It means the [;;4mTime[0m value is interpreted
    as a time in milliseconds relative current Erlang monotonic
    time.

  [;;4m[;;4m{abs, true}[0m[0m:
    Absolute [;;4mTime[0m value. The [;;4mTime[0m value is interpreted as an
    absolute Erlang monotonic time in milliseconds.

  More [;;4mOption[0ms can be added in the future.

  The absolute point in time, the timer is set to expire on, must be
  in the interval [;;4m[ [0merlang:convert_time_unit[;;4m([0merlang:system_info[;;4m[0m
  [;;4m(start_time), native, millisecond), [0merlang:convert_time_unit[;;4m([0m
  erlang:system_info[;;4m(end_time), native, millisecond) ][0m. If a
  relative time is specified, the [;;4mTime[0m value is not allowed to be
  negative.

  If [;;4mDest[0m is a [;;4mpid()[0m, it must be a [;;4mpid()[0m of a process created
  on the current runtime system instance. This process has either
  terminated or not. If [;;4mDest[0m is an [;;4matom()[0m, it is interpreted as
  the name of a locally registered process. The process referred to
  by the name is looked up at the time of timer expiration. No error
  is returned if the name does not refer to a process.

  If [;;4mDest[0m is a [;;4mpid()[0m, the timer is automatically canceled if the
  process referred to by the [;;4mpid()[0m is not alive, or if the process
  exits. This feature was introduced in ERTS 5.4.11. Notice that
  timers are not automatically canceled when [;;4mDest[0m is an [;;4matom()[0m.

  See also [;;4merlang:send_after/4[0m, [;;4merlang:cancel_timer/2[0m, and [;;4m[0m
  [;;4merlang:read_timer/2[0m.

  Failure: [;;4mbadarg[0m if the arguments do not satisfy the requirements
  specified here.
