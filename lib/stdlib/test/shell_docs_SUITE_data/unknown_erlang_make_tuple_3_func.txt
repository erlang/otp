[;1m  make_tuple(Arity, DefaultValue, InitList)[0m

  Creates a tuple of size [;;4mArity[0m, where each element has value [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mDefaultValue[0m, and then fills in values from [;;4mInitList[0m.

  Each list element in [;;4mInitList[0m must be a two-tuple, where the
  first element is a position in the newly created tuple and the
  second element is any term. If a position occurs more than once in
  the list, the term corresponding to the last occurrence is used.

  For example:

    > erlang:make_tuple(5, [], [{2,ignored},{5,zz},{2,aa}]).
    {[],aa,[],[],zz}
