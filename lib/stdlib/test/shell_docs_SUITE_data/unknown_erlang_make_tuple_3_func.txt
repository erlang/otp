  Creates a tuple of size [;;4mArity[0m, where each element has value [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mDefaultValue[0m, and then fills in values from [;;4mInitList[0m. Each list
  element in [;;4mInitList[0m must be a two-tuple, where the first element
  is a position in the newly created tuple and the second element is
  any term. If a position occurs more than once in the list, the
  term corresponding to the last occurrence is used. Example:

    > erlang:make_tuple(5, [], [{2,ignored},{5,zz},{2,aa}]).
    {[],aa,[],[],zz}
