  Calculates, without doing the encoding, the maximum byte size for
  a term encoded in the Erlang external term format. The following
  condition applies always:

    > Size1 = byte_size(term_to_binary(Term)),
    > Size2 = erlang:external_size(Term),
    > true = Size1 =< Size2.
    true

  This is equivalent to a call to:

    erlang:external_size(Term, [])
