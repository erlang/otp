  Opens file [;;4mFile[0m in the mode determined by [;;4mModes[0m, which can
  contain one or more of the following options:

  [;;4m[;;4mread[0m[0m:
    The file, which must exist, is opened for reading.

  [;;4m[;;4mwrite[0m[0m:
    The file is opened for writing. It is created if it does not
    exist. If the file exists and [;;4mwrite[0m is not combined with [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mread[0m, the file is truncated.

  [;;4m[;;4mappend[0m[0m:
    The file is opened for writing. It is created if it does not
    exist. Every write operation to a file opened with [;;4mappend[0m
    takes place at the end of the file.

  [;;4m[;;4mexclusive[0m[0m:
    The file is opened for writing. It is created if it does not
    exist. If the file exists, [;;4m{error, eexist}[0m is returned.

    Warning:
      This option does not guarantee exclusiveness on file
      systems not supporting [;;4mO_EXCL[0m properly, such as NFS. Do
      not depend on this option unless you know that the file
      system supports it (in general, local file systems are
      safe).

  [;;4m[;;4mraw[0m[0m:
    Allows faster access to a file, as no Erlang process is needed
    to handle the file. However, a file opened in this way has the
    following limitations:

     • The functions in the [;;4mio[0m module cannot be used, as they
       can only talk to an Erlang process. Instead, use
       functions [;;4mread/2[0m, [;;4mread_line/1[0m, and [;;4mwrite/2[0m.

     • Especially if [;;4mread_line/1[0m is to be used on a [;;4mraw[0m
       file, it is recommended to combine this option with
       option [;;4m{read_ahead, Size}[0m as line-oriented I/O is
       inefficient without buffering.

     • Only the Erlang process that opened the file can use it.

     • A remote Erlang file server cannot be used. The computer
       on which the Erlang node is running must have access to
       the file system (directly or through NFS).

  [;;4m[;;4mbinary[0m[0m:
    Read operations on the file return binaries rather than lists.

  [;;4m[;;4m{delayed_write, Size, Delay}[0m[0m:
    Data in subsequent [;;4mwrite/2[0m calls is buffered until at least [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mSize[0m bytes are buffered, or until the oldest buffered data is [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mDelay[0m milliseconds old. Then all buffered data is written in
    one operating system call. The buffered data is also flushed
    before some other file operation than [;;4mwrite/2[0m is executed.

    The purpose of this option is to increase performance by
    reducing the number of operating system calls. Thus, the [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mwrite/2[0m calls must be for sizes significantly less than [;;4mSize[0m,
    and not interspersed by too many other file operations.

    When this option is used, the result of [;;4mwrite/2[0m calls can
    prematurely be reported as successful, and if a write error
    occurs, the error is reported as the result of the next file
    operation, which is not executed.

    For example, when [;;4mdelayed_write[0m is used, after a number of [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mwrite/2[0m calls, [;;4mclose/1[0m can return [;;4m{error, enospc}[0m, as
    there is not enough space on the disc for previously written
    data. [;;4mclose/1[0m must probably be called again, as the file is
    still open.

  [;;4m[;;4mdelayed_write[0m[0m:
    The same as [;;4m{delayed_write, Size, Delay}[0m with reasonable
    default values for [;;4mSize[0m and [;;4mDelay[0m (roughly some 64 KB, 2
    seconds).

  [;;4m[;;4m{read_ahead, Size}[0m[0m:
    Activates read data buffering. If [;;4mread/2[0m calls are for
    significantly less than [;;4mSize[0m bytes, read operations to the
    operating system are still performed for blocks of [;;4mSize[0m
    bytes. The extra data is buffered and returned in subsequent [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mread/2[0m calls, giving a performance gain as the number of
    operating system calls is reduced.

    The [;;4mread_ahead[0m buffer is also highly used by function [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mread_line/1[0m in [;;4mraw[0m mode, therefore this option is
    recommended (for performance reasons) when accessing raw files
    using that function.

    If [;;4mread/2[0m calls are for sizes not significantly less than,
    or even greater than [;;4mSize[0m bytes, no performance gain can be
    expected.

  [;;4m[;;4mread_ahead[0m[0m:
    The same as [;;4m{read_ahead, Size}[0m with a reasonable default
    value for [;;4mSize[0m (roughly some 64 KB).

  [;;4m[;;4mcompressed[0m[0m:
    Makes it possible to read or write gzip compressed files.
    Option [;;4mcompressed[0m must be combined with [;;4mread[0m or [;;4mwrite[0m,
    but not both. Notice that the file size obtained with [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mread_file_info/1[0m does probably not match the number of bytes
    that can be read from a compressed file.

  [;;4m[;;4mcompressed_one[0m[0m:
    Read one member of a gzip compressed file. Option [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mcompressed_one[0m can only be combined with [;;4mread[0m.

  [;;4m[;;4m{encoding, Encoding}[0m[0m:
    Makes the file perform automatic translation of characters to
    and from a specific (Unicode) encoding. Notice that the data
    supplied to [;;4mwrite/2[0m or returned by [;;4mread/2[0m still is
    byte-oriented; this option denotes only how data is stored in
    the disk file.

    Depending on the encoding, different methods of reading and
    writing data is preferred. The default encoding of [;;4mlatin1[0m
    implies using this module ([;;4mfile[0m) for reading and writing
    data as the interfaces provided here work with byte-oriented
    data. Using other (Unicode) encodings makes the [;;4mio(3)[0m
    functions [;;4mget_chars[0m, [;;4mget_line[0m, and [;;4mput_chars[0m more
    suitable, as they can work with the full Unicode range.

    If data is sent to an [;;4mio_device()[0m in a format that cannot be
    converted to the specified encoding, or if data is read by a
    function that returns data in a format that cannot cope with
    the character range of the data, an error occurs and the file
    is closed.

    Allowed values for [;;4mEncoding[0m:

    [;;4m[;;4mlatin1[0m[0m:
      The default encoding. Bytes supplied to the file, that is, [;;4m[0m
      [;;4mwrite/2[0m are written "as is" on the file. Likewise, bytes
      read from the file, that is, [;;4mread/2[0m are returned "as
      is". If module [;;4mio(3)[0m is used for writing, the file can
      only cope with Unicode characters up to code point 255
      (the ISO Latin-1 range).

    [;;4m[;;4municode or utf8[0m[0m:
      Characters are translated to and from UTF-8 encoding
      before they are written to or read from the file. A file
      opened in this way can be readable using function [;;4mread/2[0m,
      as long as no data stored on the file lies beyond the ISO
      Latin-1 range (0..255), but failure occurs if the data
      contains Unicode code points beyond that range. The file
      is best read with the functions in the Unicode aware
      module [;;4mio(3)[0m.

      Bytes written to the file by any means are translated to
      UTF-8 encoding before being stored on the disk file.

    [;;4m[;;4mutf16 or {utf16,big}[0m[0m:
      Works like [;;4municode[0m, but translation is done to and from
      big endian UTF-16 instead of UTF-8.

    [;;4m[;;4m{utf16,little}[0m[0m:
      Works like [;;4municode[0m, but translation is done to and from
      little endian UTF-16 instead of UTF-8.

    [;;4m[;;4mutf32 or {utf32,big}[0m[0m:
      Works like [;;4municode[0m, but translation is done to and from
      big endian UTF-32 instead of UTF-8.

    [;;4m[;;4m{utf32,little}[0m[0m:
      Works like [;;4municode[0m, but translation is done to and from
      little endian UTF-32 instead of UTF-8.

    The Encoding can be changed for a file "on the fly" by using
    function [;;4mio:setopts/2[0m. So a file can be analyzed in latin1
    encoding for, for example, a BOM, positioned beyond the BOM
    and then be set for the right encoding before further reading.
    For functions identifying BOMs, see module [;;4municode(3)[0m.

    This option is not allowed on [;;4mraw[0m files.

  [;;4m[;;4mram[0m[0m:
    [;;4mFile[0m must be [;;4miodata()[0m. Returns an [;;4mfd()[0m, which lets module [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mfile[0m operate on the data in-memory as if it is a file.

  [;;4m[;;4msync[0m[0m:
    On platforms supporting it, enables the POSIX [;;4mO_SYNC[0m
    synchronous I/O flag or its platform-dependent equivalent (for
    example, [;;4mFILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH[0m on Windows) so that writes
    to the file block until the data is physically written to
    disk. However, be aware that the exact semantics of this flag
    differ from platform to platform. For example, none of Linux
    or Windows guarantees that all file metadata are also written
    before the call returns. For precise semantics, check the
    details of your platform documentation. On platforms with no
    support for POSIX [;;4mO_SYNC[0m or equivalent, use of the [;;4msync[0m
    flag causes [;;4mopen[0m to return [;;4m{error, enotsup}[0m.

  [;;4m[;;4mdirectory[0m[0m:
    Allows [;;4mopen[0m to work on directories.

  Returns:

  [;;4m[;;4m{ok, IoDevice}[0m[0m:
    The file is opened in the requested mode. [;;4mIoDevice[0m is a
    reference to the file.

  [;;4m[;;4m{error, Reason}[0m[0m:
    The file cannot be opened.

  [;;4mIoDevice[0m is really the pid of the process that handles the file.
  This process monitors the process that originally opened the file
  (the owner process). If the owner process terminates, the file is
  closed and the process itself terminates too. An [;;4mIoDevice[0m
  returned from this call can be used as an argument to the I/O
  functions (see [;;4mio(3)[0m).

  Warning:
    While this function can be used to open any file, we recommend
    against using it for NFS-mounted files, FIFOs, devices, or
    similar since they can cause IO threads to hang forever.

    If your application needs to interact with these kinds of
    files we recommend breaking out those parts to a port program
    instead.

  Note:
    In previous versions of [;;4mfile[0m, modes were specified as one of
    the atoms [;;4mread[0m, [;;4mwrite[0m, or [;;4mread_write[0m instead of a list.
    This is still allowed for reasons of backwards compatibility,
    but is not to be used for new code. Also note that [;;4mread_write[0m
    is not allowed in a mode list.

  Typical error reasons:

  [;;4m[;;4menoent[0m[0m:
    The file does not exist.

  [;;4m[;;4meacces[0m[0m:
    Missing permission for reading the file or searching one of
    the parent directories.

  [;;4m[;;4meisdir[0m[0m:
    The named file is a directory.

  [;;4m[;;4menotdir[0m[0m:
    A component of the filename is not a directory, or the
    filename itself is not a directory if [;;4mdirectory[0m mode was
    specified. On some platforms, [;;4menoent[0m is returned instead.

  [;;4m[;;4menospc[0m[0m:
    There is no space left on the device (if [;;4mwrite[0m access was
    specified).
