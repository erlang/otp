[;1m  pwrite(IoDevice, Location, Bytes)[0m

  Combines [;;4mposition/2[0m and [;;4mwrite/2[0m in one operation, which is
  more efficient than calling them one at a time.

  [;;4mLocation[0m is only allowed to be an integer for [;;4mraw[0m and [;;4mram[0m
  modes.

  The current position of the file after the operation is undefined
  for [;;4mraw[0m mode and unchanged for [;;4mram[0m mode.

  When positioning in a file with other [;;4mencoding[0m than [;;4mlatin1[0m,
  caution must be taken to set the position on a correct character
  boundary. For details, see [;;4mposition/2[0m.
