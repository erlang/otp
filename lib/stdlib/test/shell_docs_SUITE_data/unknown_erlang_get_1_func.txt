  [;1m-spec get(Key) -> Val | undefined when Key :: term(), Val :: term().[0m

  Returns the value [;;4mVal[0m associated with [;;4mKey[0m in the process
  dictionary, or [;;4mundefined[0m if [;;4mKey[0m does not exist. The expected
  time complexity for the current implementation of this function is
  O([;;4m1[0m) and the worst case time complexity is O([;;4mN[0m), where [;;4mN[0m is
  the number of items in the process dictionary. Example:

    > put(key1, merry),
    put(key2, lambs),
    put({any, [valid, term]}, {are, playing}),
    get({any, [valid, term]}).
    {are,playing}
