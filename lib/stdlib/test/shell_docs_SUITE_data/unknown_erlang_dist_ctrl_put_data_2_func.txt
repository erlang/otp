  Deliver distribution channel data from a remote node to the local
  node.

  Note:
    Only the process registered as distribution controller for the
    distribution channel identified by [;;4mDHandle[0m is allowed to
    call this function unless an alternate input handler process
    has been registered using [;;4m[0m
    [;;4merlang:dist_ctrl_input_handler(DHandle, InputHandler)[0m. If an
    alternate input handler has been registered, only the
    registered input handler process is allowed to call this
    function.

  This function is used when implementing an alternative
  distribution carrier using processes as distribution controllers. [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mDHandle[0m is retrieved via the callback [;;4mf_handshake_complete[0m.
