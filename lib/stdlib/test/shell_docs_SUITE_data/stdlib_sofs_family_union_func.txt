[;1m  family_union(Family1)[0m

  If [;;4mFamily1[0m is a family and [;;4mFamily1[0m[i] is a set of sets for
  each i in the index set of [;;4mFamily1[0m, then [;;4mFamily2[0m is the family
  with the same index set as [;;4mFamily1[0m such that [;;4mFamily2[0m[i] is the
  union of [;;4mFamily1[0m[i].

[;1mExamples[0m

    1> F1 = sofs:from_term([{a,[[1,2],[2,3]]},{b,[[]]}]).
    2> F2 = sofs:family_union(F1).
    3> sofs:to_external(F2).
    [{a,[1,2,3]},{b,[]}]

  [;;4mfamily_union(F)[0m is equivalent to [;;4mfamily_projection(fun[0m
  [;;4msofs:union/1, F)[0m.

[;1m  family_union(Family1, Family2)[0m

  If [;;4mFamily1[0m and [;;4mFamily2[0m are families, then [;;4mFamily3[0m is the
  family such that the index set is the union of [;;4mFamily1[0m:s and [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mFamily2[0m:s index sets, and [;;4mFamily3[0m[i] is the union of [;;4mFamily1[0m
  [i] and [;;4mFamily2[0m[i] if both map i, otherwise [;;4mFamily1[0m[i] or [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mFamily2[0m[i].
