  Sets the value of the [;;4mget_size[0m option on the distribution
  channel identified by [;;4mDHandle[0m. This option controls the return
  value of calls to erlang:dist_ctrl_get_data(DHandle) where [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mDHandle[0m equals [;;4mDHandle[0m used when setting this option. When the [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mget_size[0m option is:

  [;;4m[;;4mfalse[0m[0m:
    and there are distribution data available, a call to [;;4m[0m
    [;;4merlang:dist_ctrl_get_data(DHandle)[0m will just return [;;4mData[0m to
    pass over the channel. This is the default value of the [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mget_size[0m option.

  [;;4m[;;4mtrue[0m[0m:
    and there are distribution data available, a call to [;;4m[0m
    [;;4merlang:dist_ctrl_get_data(DHandle)[0m will return [;;4mData[0m to pass
    over the channel as well as the [;;4mSize[0m of [;;4mData[0m in bytes.
    This is returned as a tuple on the form [;;4m{Size, Data}[0m.

  All options are set to default when a channel is closed.

  Note:
    Only the process registered as distribution controller for the
    distribution channel identified by [;;4mDHandle[0m is allowed to
    call this function.

  This function is used when implementing an alternative
  distribution carrier using processes as distribution controllers. [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mDHandle[0m is retrieved via the callback [;;4mf_handshake_complete[0m.

  Guide âžœ How to implement an Alternative Carrier for the Erlang
  Distribution âžœ Distribution Module.
