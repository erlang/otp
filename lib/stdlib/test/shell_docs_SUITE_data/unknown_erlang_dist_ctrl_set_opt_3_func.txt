[;1m  dist_ctrl_set_opt(DHandle, Opt, Val)[0m

[;;4mSince[0m:
  OTP 22.0

  Sets the value of the [;;4mget_size[0m option on the distribution
  channel identified by [;;4mDHandle[0m.

  This option controls the return value of calls to
  erlang:dist_ctrl_get_data(DHandle) where [;;4mDHandle[0m equals [;;4mDHandle[0m
  used when setting this option. When the [;;4mget_size[0m option is:

   • [;;4mfalse[0m - and there are distribution data available, a call
     to [;;4merlang:dist_ctrl_get_data(DHandle)[0m will just return [;;4m[0m
     [;;4mData[0m to pass over the channel. This is the default value of
     the [;;4mget_size[0m option.

   • [;;4mtrue[0m - and there are distribution data available, a call to [;;4m[0m
     [;;4merlang:dist_ctrl_get_data(DHandle)[0m will return [;;4mData[0m to
     pass over the channel as well as the [;;4mSize[0m of [;;4mData[0m in
     bytes. This is returned as a tuple of the form [;;4m{Size, Data}[0m.

  All options are set to default when a channel is closed.

  [;;4mNote[0m

    Only the process registered as distribution controller for the
    distribution channel identified by [;;4mDHandle[0m is allowed to
    call this function.

  This function is used when implementing an alternative
  distribution carrier using processes as distribution controllers. [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mDHandle[0m is retrieved via the callback [;;4mf_handshake_complete[0m.
  More information can be found in the documentation of ERTS User's
  Guide ➜ How to implement an Alternative Carrier for the Erlang
  Distribution ➜ Distribution Module.
