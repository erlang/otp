  Cancels a timer that has been created by [;;4merlang:start_timer[0m or [;;4m[0m
  [;;4merlang:send_after[0m. [;;4mTimerRef[0m identifies the timer, and was
  returned by the BIF that created the timer.

  [;;4mOption[0ms:

  [;;4m[;;4m{async, Async}[0m[0m:
    Asynchronous request for cancellation. [;;4mAsync[0m defaults to [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mfalse[0m, which causes the cancellation to be performed
    synchronously. When [;;4mAsync[0m is set to [;;4mtrue[0m, the cancel
    operation is performed asynchronously. That is, [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mcancel_timer()[0m sends an asynchronous request for cancellation
    to the timer service that manages the timer, and then returns [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mok[0m.

  [;;4m[;;4m{info, Info}[0m[0m:
    Requests information about the [;;4mResult[0m of the cancellation. [;;4m[0m
    [;;4mInfo[0m defaults to [;;4mtrue[0m, which means the [;;4mResult[0m is given.
    When [;;4mInfo[0m is set to [;;4mfalse[0m, no information about the result
    of the cancellation is given.

     • When [;;4mAsync[0m is [;;4mfalse[0m: if [;;4mInfo[0m is [;;4mtrue[0m, the [;;4m[0m
       [;;4mResult[0m is returned by [;;4merlang:cancel_timer()[0m.
       otherwise [;;4mok[0m is returned.

     • When [;;4mAsync[0m is [;;4mtrue[0m: if [;;4mInfo[0m is [;;4mtrue[0m, a message
       on the form [;;4m{cancel_timer, TimerRef, Result}[0m is sent
       to the caller of [;;4merlang:cancel_timer()[0m when the
       cancellation operation has been performed, otherwise no
       message is sent.

  More [;;4mOption[0ms may be added in the future.

  If [;;4mResult[0m is an integer, it represents the time in milliseconds
  left until the canceled timer would have expired.

  If [;;4mResult[0m is [;;4mfalse[0m, a timer corresponding to [;;4mTimerRef[0m could
  not be found. This can be either because the timer had expired,
  already had been canceled, or because [;;4mTimerRef[0m never
  corresponded to a timer. Even if the timer had expired, it does
  not tell you if the time-out message has arrived at its
  destination yet.

  Note:
    The timer service that manages the timer can be co-located
    with another scheduler than the scheduler that the calling
    process is executing on. If so, communication with the timer
    service takes much longer time than if it is located locally.
    If the calling process is in critical path, and can do other
    things while waiting for the result of this operation, or is
    not interested in the result of the operation, you want to use
    option [;;4m{async, true}[0m. If using option [;;4m{async, false}[0m, the
    calling process blocks until the operation has been performed.

  See also [;;4merlang:send_after/4[0m, [;;4merlang:start_timer/4[0m, and [;;4m[0m
  [;;4merlang:read_timer/2[0m.
