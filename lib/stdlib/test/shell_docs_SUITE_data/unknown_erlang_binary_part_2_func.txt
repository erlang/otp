  Extracts the part of the binary described by [;;4mPosLen[0m.

  Negative length can be used to extract bytes at the end of a
  binary, for example:

    1> Bin = <<1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10>>.
    2> binary_part(Bin,{byte_size(Bin), -5}).
    <<6,7,8,9,10>>

  Failure: [;;4mbadarg[0m if [;;4mPosLen[0m in any way references outside the
  binary.

  [;;4mStart[0m is zero-based, that is:

    1> Bin = <<1,2,3>>
    2> binary_part(Bin,{0,2}).
    <<1,2>>

  For details about the [;;4mPosLen[0m semantics, see [;;4mbinary(3)[0m.

  Allowed in guard tests.
