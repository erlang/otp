  Register an alternate input handler process for the distribution
  channel identified by [;;4mDHandle[0m. Once this function has been
  called, [;;4mInputHandler[0m is the only process allowed to call [;;4m[0m
  [;;4merlang:dist_ctrl_put_data(DHandle, Data)[0m with the [;;4mDHandle[0m
  identifying this distribution channel.

  Note:
    Only the process registered as distribution controller for the
    distribution channel identified by [;;4mDHandle[0m is allowed to
    call this function.

  This function is used when implementing an alternative
  distribution carrier using processes as distribution controllers. [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mDHandle[0m is retrieved via the callback [;;4mf_handshake_complete[0m.
  More information can be found in the documentation of ERTS User's
  Guide âžœ How to implement an Alternative Carrier for the Erlang
  Distribution âžœ Distribution Module.
