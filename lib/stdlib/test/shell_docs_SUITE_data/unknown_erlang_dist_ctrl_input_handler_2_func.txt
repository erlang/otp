[;1m  dist_ctrl_input_handler(DHandle, InputHandler)[0m

[;;4mSince[0m:
  OTP 21.0

  Register an alternate input handler process for the distribution
  channel identified by [;;4mDHandle[0m.

  Once this function has been called, [;;4mInputHandler[0m is the only
  process allowed to call [;;4merlang:dist_ctrl_put_data(DHandle, Data)[0m
  with the [;;4mDHandle[0m identifying this distribution channel.

  [;;4mNote[0m

    When the distribution controller for the distribution channel
    identified by [;;4mDHandle[0m is a process, it is the only process
    allowed to call this function. This function is also allowed
    to be called when the distribution controller for the
    distribution channel identified by [;;4mDHandle[0m is a port. The
    data received by the port should in this case be delivered to
    the process identified by [;;4mInputHandler[0m which in turn should
    call [;;4merlang:dist_ctrl_put_data/2[0m.

  This function is used when implementing an alternative
  distribution carrier. [;;4mDHandle[0m is retrieved via the callback [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mf_handshake_complete[0m. More information can be found in the
  documentation of ERTS User's Guide ➜ How to implement an
  Alternative Carrier for the Erlang Distribution ➜ Distribution
  Module.
