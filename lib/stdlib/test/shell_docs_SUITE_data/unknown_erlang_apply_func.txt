[;1m  apply(Fun, Args)[0m

  Calls a fun, passing the elements in [;;4mArgs[0m as arguments.

  If the number of elements in the arguments are known at compile
  time, the call is better written as [;;4mFun(Arg1, Arg2, ... ArgN)[0m.

  [;;4mWarning[0m

    Earlier, [;;4mFun[0m could also be specified as [;;4m{Module, Function}[0m,
    equivalent to [;;4mapply(Module, Function, Args)[0m. This use is
    deprecated and will stop working in a future release.

[;1m  apply(Module, Function, Args)[0m

  Returns the result of applying [;;4mFunction[0m in [;;4mModule[0m to [;;4mArgs[0m.
  The applied function must be exported from [;;4mModule[0m. The arity of
  the function is the length of [;;4mArgs[0m.

  For example:

    > apply(lists, reverse, [[a, b, c]]).
    [c,b,a]
    > apply(erlang, atom_to_list, ['Erlang']).
    "Erlang"

  If the number of arguments are known at compile time, the call is
  better written as [;;4mModule:Function(Arg1, Arg2, ..., ArgN)[0m.

  Failure: [;;4merror_handler:undefined_function/3[0m is called if the
  applied function is not exported. The error handler can be
  redefined (see [;;4mprocess_flag/2[0m). If [;;4merror_handler[0m is undefined,
  or if the user has redefined the default [;;4merror_handler[0m so the
  replacement module is undefined, an error with reason [;;4mundef[0m is
  generated.
