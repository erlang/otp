  Warning:
    This function is deprecated as [;;4merlang:phash2/2[0m should be
    used for new code. Note that [;;4merlang:phash(X,N)[0m is not

  Portable hash function that gives the same hash for the same
  Erlang term regardless of machine architecture and ERTS version
  (the BIF was introduced in ERTS 4.9.1.1). The function returns a
  hash value for [;;4mTerm[0m within the range [;;4m1..Range[0m. The maximum
  value for [;;4mRange[0m is 2^32.
