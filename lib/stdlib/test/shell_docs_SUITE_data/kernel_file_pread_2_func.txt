[;1m  pread(IoDevice, LocNums)[0m

  Performs a sequence of [;;4mpread/3[0m in one operation, which is more
  efficient than calling them one at a time. Returns [;;4m{ok, [Data,[0m
  [;;4m...]}[0m or [;;4m{error, Reason}[0m, where each [;;4mData[0m, the result of the
  corresponding [;;4mpread[0m, is either a list or a binary depending on
  the mode of the file, or [;;4meof[0m if the requested position is beyond
  end of file.

  As the position is specified as a byte-offset, take special
  caution when working with files where [;;4mencoding[0m is set to
  something else than [;;4mlatin1[0m, as not every byte position is a
  valid character boundary on such a file.
