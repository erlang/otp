[;1m  spawn_monitor(Node, Fun)[0m

[;;4mSince[0m:
  OTP 23.0

  Returns the process identifier of a new process, started by the
  application of [;;4mFun[0m to the empty list [;;4m[][0m on the node [;;4mNode[0m,
  and a reference for a monitor created to the new process.
  Otherwise works like [;;4mspawn/3[0m.

  If the node identified by [;;4mNode[0m does not support distributed [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mspawn_monitor()[0m, the call will fail with a [;;4mnotsup[0m exception.
