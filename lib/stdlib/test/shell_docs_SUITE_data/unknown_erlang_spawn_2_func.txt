  [;1m-spec spawn(Node, Fun) -> pid() when Node :: node(), Fun :: function().[0m

  Returns the process identifier of a new process started by the
  application of [;;4mFun[0m to the empty list [;;4m[][0m on [;;4mNode[0m. If [;;4mNode[0m
  does not exist, a useless pid is returned. Otherwise works like [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mspawn/3[0m.
