[;1m  path_script(Path, Filename)[0m

  Searches the path [;;4mPath[0m (a list of directory names) until the
  file [;;4mFilename[0m is found. If [;;4mFilename[0m is an absolute filename, [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mPath[0m is ignored. Then reads and evaluates Erlang expressions,
  separated by [;;4m.[0m (or [;;4m,[0m, a sequence of expressions is also an
  expression), from the file.

  Returns one of the following:

   • [;;4m{ok, Value, FullName}[0m - The file is read and evaluated. [;;4m[0m
     [;;4mFullName[0m is the full name of the file and [;;4mValue[0m the value
     of the last expression.

   • [;;4m{error, enoent}[0m - The file cannot be found in any of the
     directories in [;;4mPath[0m.

   • [;;4m{error, atom()}[0m - An error occurred when opening the file
     or reading it. For a list of typical error codes, see [;;4m[0m
     [;;4mopen/2[0m.

   • [;;4m{error, {Line, Mod, Term}}[0m - An error occurred when
     interpreting the Erlang expressions in the file. Use [;;4m[0m
     [;;4mformat_error/1[0m to convert the three-element tuple to an
     English description of the error.

  The encoding of [;;4mFilename[0m can be set by a comment as described in [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mepp[0m.
