    <icaption>The Purpose of Agent Net if</icaption>
  </image>
  <p>The Network Interface (Net if) process delivers SNMP PDUs to a
    master agent, and receives SNMP PDUs from the master agent. The most
    common behaviour of a Net if process is that is receives bytes from
    a network, decodes them into an SNMP PDU, which it sends to a master
    agent. When the master agent has processed the PDU, it sends a
    response PDU to the Net if process, which encodes the PDU into bytes
    and transmits the bytes onto the network.
    </p>
  <p>However, that simple behaviour can be modified in numerous
    ways. For example, the Net if process can apply some kind of
    encrypting/decrypting scheme on the bytes or
    act as a proxy filter, which sends some packets to a proxy agent and
    some packets to the master agent.
    </p>
  <p>It is also possible to write your own Net if process. The default
    Net if process is implemented in the module <c>snmpa_net_if</c> and
    it uses UDP as the transport protocol.
    </p>
  <p>This section describes how to write a Net if process.

      <title>Outgoing Messages</title>
      <p>Net if must send the following message when it receives an
      SNMP PDU from the network that is aimed for the MasterAgent:

        <item><c>Pdu</c> is an SNMP PDU record, as defined in
        <c>snmp_types.hrl</c>, with the SNMP request.
        </item>
        <item><c>PduMS</c> is the Maximum Size of the response Pdu
         allowed.  Normally this is returned from
        <c>snmpa_mpd:process_packet</c> (see Reference Manual).
        </item>
        <item><c>ACMData</c> is data used by the Access Control Module

        <item><c>From</c> is the source address. If UDP over IP is

         is an integer.
        </item>
        <item><c>Extra</c> is any term the Net if process wishes to
         send to the agent. This term can be retrieved by the
         instrumentation functions by calling
        <c>snmp:current_net_if_data()</c>. This data is also sent back
         to the Net if process when the agent generates a response to
         the request.</item>

      <title>Notes</title>
      <p>Since the Net if process is responsible for encoding and
        decoding of SNMP messages, it must also update the relevant
        counters in the SNMP group in MIB-II. It can use the functions
        in the module <c>snmpa_mpd</c> for this purpose (refer to the 
        Reference Manual, section <c>snmp</c>, 
        module <seealso marker="snmp_pdus">snmpa_mpd</seealso>
        for more details.)
        </p>
      <p>There are also some useful functions for encoding and
        decoding of SNMP messages in the module 
        <seealso marker="snmp_pdus">snmp_pdus</seealso>.
