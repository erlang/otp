            The type of the resource can be determined by looking
            at the OID that describes the resource.

            Resources must be identified in a consistent manner.
            For example, if this resource is an interface, this
            object MUST point to an ifIndex and if this resource
            is a physical entity [RFC2737], then this MUST point
            to an entPhysicalDescr, given that entPhysicalIndex
            is not accessible.  In general, the value is the
            name of the instance of the first accessible columnar
            object in the conceptual row of a table that is
            meaningful for this resource type, which SHOULD
