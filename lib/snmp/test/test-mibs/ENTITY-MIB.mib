    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
            "An indication of the relative position of this 'child'
            component among all its 'sibling' components. Sibling
            components are defined as entPhysicalEntries which share the
            same instance values of each of the entPhysicalContainedIn
            and entPhysicalClass objects.

            An NMS can use this object to identify the relative ordering
            for all sibling components of a particular parent
            (identified by the entPhysicalContainedIn instance in each
            sibling entry).

            This value should match any external labeling of the
            physical component if possible. For example, for a module
            labeled as 'card #3', entPhysicalParentRelPos should have
            the value '3'.

            If the physical position of this component does not match
            any external numbering or clearly visible ordering, then
            user documentation or other external reference material
            should be used to determine the parent-relative position. If
            this is not possible, then the the agent should assign a
            consistent (but possibly arbitrary) ordering to a given set
            of 'sibling' components, perhaps based on internal
            representation of the components.

            If the agent cannot determine the parent-relative position
            for some reason, or if the associated value of
            entPhysicalContainedIn is '0', then the value '-1' is
            returned. Otherwise a non-negative integer is returned,
            indicating the parent-relative position of this physical
            entity.

            Parent-relative ordering normally starts from '1' and
            continues to 'N', where 'N' represents the highest
            positioned child entity.  However, if the physical entities
            (e.g. slots) are labeled from a starting position of zero,
            then the first sibling should be associated with a
            entPhysicalParentRelPos value of '0'.  Note that this
            ordering may be sparse or dense, depending on agent
            implementation.

            The actual values returned are not globally meaningful, as
            each 'parent' component may use different numbering
            algorithms. The ordering is only meaningful among siblings
            of the same parent component.


            The agent should retain parent-relative position values
            across reboots, either through algorithmic assignment or use
            of non-volatile storage."

            based on the privileges of the request used to read this

            string with read-only privileges, even if this object is
            accessed with a read-write community string. However, the
            agent must take care not to return a community string which

            A compliant SNMP agent may wish to conserve naming scopes by
            representing multiple logical entities in a single 'main'
            naming scope.  This is possible when the logical entities
            represented by the same value of entLogicalCommunity have no
            object instances in common.  For example, 'bridge1' and
            'repeater1' may be part of the main naming scope, but at

            'bridge2' and 'repeater2'.

            Logical entities 'bridge1' and 'repeater1' would be

            known by this agent, there are zero or more mappings to the
            physical resources which are used to realize that logical
            entity.

            An agent should limit the number and nature of entries in
            this table such that only meaningful and non-redundant
            information is returned. For example, in a system which
            contains a single power supply, mappings between logical
            entities and the power supply are not useful and should not
            be included.

            Also, only the most appropriate physical component which is
            closest to the root of a particular containment tree should
            be identified in an entLPMapping entry.

            For example, suppose a bridge is realized on a particular
            module, and all ports on that module are ports on this
            bridge. A mapping between the bridge and the module would be
            useful, but additional mappings between the bridge and each
            of the ports on that module would be redundant (since the
            entPhysicalContainedIn hierarchy can provide the same
            information). If, on the other hand, more than one bridge
            was utilizing ports on this module, then mappings between
            each bridge and the ports it used would be appropriate.

            Also, in the case of a single backplane repeater, a mapping


            for the backplane to the single repeater entity is not

entAliasLogicalIndexOrZero OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX      INTEGER (0..2147483647)
    MAX-ACCESS  not-accessible
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
            "The value of this object uniquely identifies the logical
            entity which defines the naming scope for the associated
            instance of the 'entAliasMappingIdentifier' object.

            If this object has a non-zero value, then it identifies the
            logical entity named by the same value of entLogicalIndex.

            If this object has a value of zero, then the mapping between
            the physical component and the alias identifier for this
            entAliasMapping entry is associated with all unspecified
            logical entities. That is, a value of zero (the default
            mapping) identifies any logical entity which does not have
            an explicit entry in this table for a particular
            entPhysicalIndex/entAliasMappingIdentifier pair.

            For example, to indicate that a particular interface (e.g.
            physical component 33) is identified by the same value of
            ifIndex for all logical entities, the following instance
            might exist:



                    entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.0 = ifIndex.5

            In the event an entPhysicalEntry is associated differently
            for some logical entities, additional entAliasMapping
            entries may exist, e.g.:

                    entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.0 = ifIndex.6
                    entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.4 =  ifIndex.1
                    entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.5 =  ifIndex.1
                    entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.10 = ifIndex.12

            Note that entries with non-zero entAliasLogicalIndexOrZero
            index values have precedence over any zero-indexed entry. In
            this example, all logical entities except 4, 5, and 10,
            associate physical entity 33 with ifIndex.6."

entAliasMappingIdentifier OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX      RowPointer
    MAX-ACCESS  read-only
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
            "The value of this object identifies a particular conceptual
            row associated with the indicated entPhysicalIndex and
            entLogicalIndex pair.

            Since only physical ports are modeled in this table, only
            entries which represent interfaces or ports are allowed.  If
            an ifEntry exists on behalf of a particular physical port,
            then this object should identify the associated 'ifEntry'.
            For repeater ports, the appropriate row in the
            'rptrPortGroupTable' should be identified instead.

            For example, suppose a physical port was represented by
            entPhysicalEntry.3, entLogicalEntry.15 existed for a
            repeater, and entLogicalEntry.22 existed for a bridge.  Then
            there might be two related instances of
            entAliasMappingIdentifier:
               entAliasMappingIdentifier.3.15 == rptrPortGroupIndex.5.2
               entAliasMappingIdentifier.3.22 == ifIndex.17
            It is possible that other mappings (besides interfaces and
            repeater ports) may be defined in the future, as required.

            Bridge ports are identified by examining the Bridge MIB and
            appropriate ifEntries associated with each 'dot1dBasePort',
            and are thus not represented in this table."

            is the transmission of a single trap PDU to a list of trap

            within the five second 'throttling' period, then these
            trap-events should be suppressed by the agent. An NMS should
