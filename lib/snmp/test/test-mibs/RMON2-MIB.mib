ZeroBasedCounter32 ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This TC describes an object which counts events with the
        following semantics: objects of this type will be set to
        zero(0) on creation and will thereafter count appropriate
        events, wrapping back to zero(0) when the value 2^32 is
        reached.

        Provided that an application discovers the new object within
        the minimum time to wrap it can use the initial value as a
        delta since it last polled the table of which this object is
        part.  It is important for a management station to be aware of
        this minimum time and the actual time between polls, and to
        discard data if the actual time is too long or there is no
        defined minimum time.

        Typically this TC is used in tables where the INDEX space is
        constantly changing and/or the TimeFilter mechanism is in use."

LastCreateTime ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This TC describes an object that stores the last time its
        entry was created.

        This can be used for polling applications to determine that an
        entry has been deleted and re-created between polls, causing
        an otherwise undetectable discontinuity in the data."

TimeFilter ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS        current
    DESCRIPTION



        "To be used for the index to a table.  Allows an application
        to download only those rows changed since a particular time.
        A row is considered changed if the value of any object in the
        row changes or if the row is created or deleted.

        When sysUpTime is equal to zero, this table shall be empty.

        One entry exists for each past value of sysUpTime, except that
        the whole table is purged should sysUpTime wrap.

        As this basic row is updated new conceptual rows are created
        (which still share the now updated object values with all
        other instances).  The number of instances which are created
        is determined by the value of sysUpTime at which the basic row
        was last updated.  One instance will exist for each value of
        sysUpTime at the last update time for the row.  A new
        timeMark instance is created for each new sysUpTime value.
        Each new conceptual row will be associated with the timeMark
        instance which was created at the value of sysUpTime with
        which the conceptual row is to be associated.

        By definition all conceptual rows were updated at or after
        time zero and so at least one conceptual row (associated with
        timeMark.0) must exist for each underlying (basic) row.

        See the appendix for further discussion of this variable.

        Consider the following fooTable:

        fooTable ...
        INDEX { fooTimeMark, fooIndex }

        FooEntry {
           fooTimeMark  TimeFilter
           fooIndex     INTEGER,
           fooCounts    Counter
        }

        Should there be two basic rows in this table (fooIndex == 1,
        fooIndex == 2) and row 1 was updated most recently at time 6,
        while row 2 was updated most recently at time 8, and both rows
        had been updated on several earlier occasions such that the
        current values were 5 and 9 respectively then the following
        fooCounts instances would exist.

        fooCounts.0.1  5
        fooCounts.0.2  9
        fooCounts.1.1  5

        fooCounts.1.2  9

    DESCRIPTION
        "A unique identifier for a particular protocol.  Standard

        can often be used as specifications for new protocols - i.e.
        a tree-structured assignment mechanism that matches the
        protocol encapsulation `tree' and which has algorithmic
        assignment mechanisms for certain subtrees. See RFC XXX for
        more details.

        Despite the algorithmic mechanism, the probe will only place
        entries in here for those protocols it chooses to collect.  In
        other words, it need not populate this table with all of the
        possible ethernet protocol types, nor need it create them on
        the fly when it sees them.  Whether or not it does these
        things is a matter of product definition (cost/benefit,
        usability), and is up to the designer of the product.

        If an entry is written to this table with a protocolDirID that
        the agent doesn't understand, either directly or

    DESCRIPTION
        "This object describes 2 attributes of this protocol
         directory entry.

         The presence or absence of the `extensible' bit describes
         whether or not this protocol directory entry can be extended


         by the user by creating protocol directory entries which are
         children of this protocol.

         An example of an entry that will often allow extensibility is
         `ip.udp'.  The probe may automatically populate some children
         of this node such as `ip.udp.snmp' and `ip.udp.dns'.
         A probe administrator or user may also populate additional
         children via remote SNMP requests that create entries in this
         table.  When a child node is added for a protocol for which the
         probe has no built in support, extending a parent node (for
         which the probe does have built in support),
         that child node is not extendible.  This is termed `limited
         extensibility'.

         When a child node is added through this extensibility
         mechanism, the values of protocolDirLocalIndex and
         protocolDirType shall be assigned by the agent.

         The other objects in the entry will be assigned by the
         manager who is creating the new entry.

         This object also describes whether or not this agent can
         recognize addresses for this protocol, should it be a network
         level protocol.  That is, while a probe may be able to
         recognize packets of a particular network layer protocol and
         count them, it takes additional logic to be able to recognize
         the addresses in this protocol and to populate network layer
         or application layer tables with the addresses in this
         protocol.  If this bit is set, the agent will recognize
         network layer addresses for this protoocl and populate the
         network and application layer host and matrix tables with
         these protocols.

         Note that when an entry is created, the agent will supply
         values for the bits that match the capabilities of the agent
         with respect to this protocol.  Note that since row creations
         usually exercise the limited extensibility feature, these
         bits will usually be set to zero."

-- User History Collection Group (usrHistory)
--
-- The usrHistory group combines mechanisms seen in the alarm and
-- history groups to provide user-specified history collection,
-- utilizing two additional control tables and one additional data
-- table. This function has traditionally been done by NMS
-- applications, via periodic polling.  The usrHistory group allows
-- this task to be offloaded to an RMON probe.
--
-- Data (an ASN.1 INTEGER based object) is collected in the same
-- manner as any history data table (e.g. etherHistoryTable) except
-- that the user specifies the MIB instances to be collected. Objects
-- are collected in bucket-groups, with the intent that all MIB
-- instances in the same bucket-group are collected as atomically as
-- possible by the RMON probe.
--
-- The usrHistoryControlTable is a one-dimensional read-create table.
-- Each row configures a collection of user history buckets, much
-- the same as a historyControlEntry, except that the creation of a
-- row in this table will cause one or more associated instances in
-- the usrHistoryObjectTable to be created. The user specifies the
-- number of bucket elements (rows in the usrHistoryObjectTable)
-- requested, as well as the number of buckets requested.
--
-- The usrHistoryObjectTable is a 2-d read-write table.
-- Each row configures a single MIB instance to be collected.
-- All rows with the same major index constitute a bucket-group.
--
-- The usrHistoryTable is a 3-d read-only table containing
-- the data of associated usrHistoryControlEntries. Each
-- entry represents the value of a single MIB instance
-- during a specific sampling interval (or the rate of
-- change during the interval).
--
-- A sample value is stored in two objects - an absolute value and
-- a status object. This allows numbers from -(2G-1) to +4G to be
-- stored.  The status object also indicates whether a sample is
-- valid. This allows data collection to continue if periodic
-- retrieval of a particular instance fails for any reason.
--
-- Row Creation Order Relationships
--


-- The static nature of the usrHistoryObjectTable creates
-- some row creation/modification issues. The rows in this
-- table need to be set before the associated
-- usrHistoryControlEntry can be activated.
--
-- Note that the usrHistoryObject entries associated with a
-- particular usrHistoryControlEntry are not required to
-- be active before the control entry is activated. However,
-- the usrHistory data entries associated with an inactive
-- usrHistoryObject entry will be inactive (i.e.
-- usrHistoryValStatus == valueNotAvailable).

    STATUS current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This data type is used to communicate with a modem or a

        remote device through the serial interface.  Commands are
        represented as two character sequences beginning with
        the `^' character.

        The following commands are recognized by the device (note
        that command characters are case sensitive):

           ^s  Send string that follows which is terminated by the
               next command or the end of string.
           ^c  Delay for the number of seconds that follows.  Toss
               out any data received rather than storing it in a
               buffer for parsing.
           ^t  Set timeout to the value represented by the decimal
               digits that follow.  The default timeout is 20
               seconds. Note that this timeout may be overridden
               by a smaller serialTimeout configured for the


               associated serial interface (see serialConfigTable).
           ^w  Wait for the reply string that follows which is
               terminated by the next command or the end of string.
               Partial and case insensitive matching is applied, ie.
               if the reply string (any case combination) is found
               anywhere in the received string, then the a match is
               found.  If the current timeout elapses without a match,
               then the remaining control string is ignored.
           ^!  The ^ character.
           ^d  Delay the number of seconds specified by the decimal
               digits that follow.
           ^b  Send break for the number of milliseconds specified by
               the decimal digits that follow.  If no digits follow,
               break will be enforced for 250 milliseconds by default.

        The following ASCII control characters may be inserted into
        the `^s' send string or the `^w' reply string:

           ^@    0x00
           ^A    0x01
            ..
           ^M    0x0D
            ..
           ^Z    0x1A
           ^[    0x1B
           ^    0x1C
           ^]    0x1D
           ^^    0x1E
           ^_    0x1F

        Binary data may also be inserted into the data stream.  The
        control sequence for each byte of binary data is ^0x##, where
        ## is the hexadecimal representation of the data byte.  Two
        ASCII characters (0-9, a-f, A-F) must follow the `^0x'
        control prefix.  For example, `^0x0D^0x0A' is interpreted as a
        carriage return followed by a line feed."
