            entity may potentially offers.  The value is a sum.  This
            sum initially takes the value zero, Then, for each layer, L,
            in the range 1 through 7, that this node performs
            transactions for, 2 raised to (L - 1) is added to the sum.
            For example, a node which performs only routing functions
            would have a value of 4 (2^(3-1)).  In contrast, a node
            which is a host offering application services would have a
            value of 72 (2^(4-1) + 2^(7-1)).  Note that in the context
            of the Internet suite of protocols, values should be
            calculated accordingly:

                 layer      functionality
                   1        physical (e.g., repeaters)

                   7        applications (e.g., supports the SMTP)
