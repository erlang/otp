AgentID ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS       current
    DESCRIPTION
            "An agent's administratively-unique identifier.

            The value for this object may not be all zeros or all 'ff'H.

            The initial value for this object may be configured via an
            operator console entry or via an algorithmic function.  In
            the later case, the following guidelines are recommended:

              1) The first four octets are set to the binary equivalent
                 of the agent's SNMP network management private
                 enterprise number as assigned by the Internet Assigned
                 Numbers Authority (IANA).  For example, if Acme
                 Networks has been assigned { enterprises 696 }, the
                 first four octets would be assigned '000002b8'H.

              2) The remaining eight octets are the cookie whose
                 contents are determined via one or more enterprise-
                 specific methods.  Such methods must be designed so as
                 to maximize the possibility that the value of this
                 object will be unique in the agent's administrative
                 domain.  For example, the cookie may be the IP address
                 of the agent, or the MAC address of one of the
                 interfaces, with each address suitably padded with
                 random octets.  If multiple methods are defined, then
                 it is recommended that the cookie be further divided
                 into one octet that indicates the method being used and
                 seven octets which are a function of the method."
