    DESCRIPTION
            "Each octet within this value specifies a set of eight ports,
            with the first octet specifying ports 1 through 8, the second
            octet specifying ports 9 through 16, etc.  Within each octet,
            the most significant bit represents the lowest numbered port,
            and the least significant bit represents the highest numbered
            port.  Thus, each port of the system is represented by a
            single bit within the value of this object.  If that bit has
            a value of '1' then that port is included in the set of ports;
            the port is not included if its bit has a value of '0'."
