  <p>This document describes the changes made to the Reltool system
    from version to version. The intention of this document is to
    list all incompatibilities as well as all enhancements and
    bugfixes for every release of Reltool. Each release of Reltool
    thus constitutes one section in this document. The title of each
    section is the version number of Reltool.</p>

	    If a module was duplicated in the library directories
	    visible to reltool, and the configuration did not point
	    out which file to use, then reltool:start would always
	    fail. A pop-up is added which asks if you want to
	    continue with a safe and minimal configuration.</p>

	    wx would sometimes crash due to an empty radiobox on the
	    'releases' tab of the system window. This radiobox is
	    removed, and replaced by a listbox which will always
	    contain at least kernel and stdlib applications.</p>

	    The system level option <c>app_files</c> is documented to
	    allow the values <c>keep | strip | all</c>, but it only
	    allowed <c>keep</c>. This is corrected.</p>

	    Allow the same module name in multiple applications
	    visible to reltool, as long as all but one of the
	    applications/modules are explicitely excluded. (Thanks to
	    Andrew Gopienko and Jay Nelson)</p>

          <p>
	    The reltool module contained two seriously erroneous
	    specs which caused bogus warnings when dialyzing reltool
	    and some correct code of users. These were fixed (specs
	    for start_link/1 and eval_server/3)</p>
          <p>
	    - Code cleanups and simplifications - Fix a bug in the
	    calculation of circular dependencies - Eliminate two
	    dialyzer warnings - Put files alphabetically</p>

    <section><title>Improvements and New Features</title>
      <list>
        <item>
          <p>
            Added function <c>zip:foldl/3</c> to iterate over zip
            archives.</p>
          <p>
            Added functions to create and extract escripts. See
            <c>escript:create/2</c> and <c>escript:extract/2</c>.</p>
          <p>
            The undocumented function <c>escript:foldl/3</c> has been
            removed. The same functionality can be achieved with the
            more flexible functions <c>escript:extract/2</c> and
            <c>zip:foldl/3</c>.</p>
          <p>
            Record fields has been annotated with type info. Source
            files as been adapted to fit within 80 chars and trailing
            whitespace has been removed.</p>

            <p>A new escript, called <c>reltool</c>, has been
            introduced in order to simplify the usage of the reltool
            application from makefiles.</p>
            <p>The handling of applications included in releases has
            been improved. Applications that are required to be
            started before other applications in a release are now
            automatically included in the release. The <c>kernel</c>
            and <c>stdlib</c> applications are always included as
            they are mandatory.</p>
            <p>Applications that are (explicitly or implicitly)
            included in a release are now automatically included as
            if they were explicitly included with the incl_cond
            flag.</p>
            <p>A new <c>embedded_app_type</c> option has been
            introduced. It is intended to be used for embedded
            systems where all included applications must be loaded
            from the boot script, as these systems does not utilize
            dynamic code loading. If <c>embedded_app_type </c> is set
            to something else than <c>undefined</c>, all included
            applications will be included in both the release as well
            as in the boot script. If the <c>profile</c> is
            <c>embedded</c> the <c>embedded_app_type</c> option
            defaults to <c>load</c>.</p>
            <p>A new function called <c>reltool:get_status/1</c> has
            been introduced. It returns status about the
            configuration in the server.</p>
            <p>The API functions that may take <c>PidOrOptions</c> as
            input and actually gets <c>Options</c> does now print out
            warnings.</p>
            <p>The internal error handling has been improved. For
            example <c>{error,Reason}</c> is always returned in case
            of errors even when the server dies.</p>
            <p><c>app</c> and <c>appup</c> files has been added as
            well as a corresponding test suite.</p>
            <p>Various cleanups has been made in the code and in the
            documentation.</p>

                The documentation is now built with open source tools
                (xsltproc and fop) that exists on most platforms. One
                visible change is that the HTML frames are removed.</p>

                In the new release of Reltool (0.5) there is a severe bug
                that may cause your source files to be deleted. The bug
                is triggered when you generate a target system WITH
                archive files AND your library directories are given with
                absolute paths. (Library directories are given with the
                ERL_LIBS environment variable or with the lib_dirs
                configuration parameter.)</p>

                The tool is still experimental. Feedback is appreciated. </p>
              <p>
                Major improvements of the target system generation has
                been performed. Now it is possible to generate a
                relocatable target system that does not need to be
                re-installed if it is moved to a new location. Archive
                files are automatically generated. A detailed
                specification of the target system can be generated
                without actually creating the target system. Relocatable
                escripts are put in the bin directory of the target
                system. etc. etc.</p>
              <p>
                Some new functions has been introduced in the
                <c>reltool</c> module: <c>start/1, start_link/1,
                get_config/3, get_target_spec/1 and
                eval_target_spec/3</c>.</p>
              <p>
                Some new configuration parameters has been introduced:
                <c>profile, incl_sys_filters, excl_sys_filters,
                incl_app_filters, excl_app_filters, incl_archive_filters,
                excl_archive_filters, archive_opts, escript and
                relocatable</c>.</p>
              <p>
                Some parameters have been obsoleted and given new
                semantics: <c>incl_erts_dirs (incl_sys_filters),
                excl_erts_dirs (excl_sys_filters), incl_app_dirs
                (incl_app_filters), excl_app_dirs (excl_app_filters) and
                escripts (escript).</c></p>
