  <p>This document describes the changes made to the Reltool system
    from version to version. The intention of this document is to
    list all incompatibilities as well as all enhancements and
    bugfixes for every release of Reltool. Each release of Reltool
    thus constitutes one section in this document. The title of each
    section is the version number of Reltool.</p>

        <item>
          <p>
	    A new sys level configuration parameter
	    <c>{excl_lib,otp_root}</c> is added. When this is set,
	    the target system will not contain anything from
	    <c>$OTP_ROOT</c>. It will only contain a releases
	    directory with rel, script and boot files, and a lib
	    directory with applications found outside of
	    <c>$OTP_ROOT</c> (i.e. "your own" applications).</p>

    <section><title>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</title>
      <list>
        <item>
          <p>
	    Miscellaneous corrections: <list> <item> Start of reltool
	    GUI would sometimes crash with a badmatch in
	    reltool_sys_win:do_init. This has been corrected. </item>
	    <item> Minor corrections of documentation and type
	    specifications of app() and mod() are done. </item>
	    <item> If a module name is duplicated in an app file
	    reltool would return an error. This is now changed to a
	    warning. </item> <item> Reltool would earlier not
	    necessarily keep the order of applications as listed in
	    the rel specification in the configuration. This has been
	    corrected. </item> <item> Reltool would earlier set the
	    default for included applications to an empty list if it
	    was not set in the rel specification in the
	    configuration. This was correct according to
	    sasl/systools documentation, but not according to
	    sasl/systools implementation. We decided to change the
	    documentation and reltool to use the value of
	    included_applications from the .app file as default
	    instead of the empty list, since this seems more
	    intuitive and since systools always has done the same.
	    </item> <item> The value of included applications in the
	    rel specification in the configuration did not overwrite
	    included_applications in the .app file if it was set to
	    an empty list. This has been corrected. </item> <item>
	    Reltool would earlier add load instructions in the
	    script/boot files for ALL modules in the ebin directory
	    of an application even if mod_cond was set to app
	    (include only modules listed in the .app file). This has
	    been corrected. </item> <item> Reltool would earlier add
	    start instructions in the script/boot file for included
	    applications. This has been corrected - included
	    applications shall only be loaded since the including
	    application is responsible for starting them. </item>
	    <item> Status bar now indicates that reltool is working
	    (Processing libraries...) for all configuration changes,
	    and when generating target system. </item> <item> Title
	    of dependecies column in app and mod window is changed
	    from "Modules used by others" to "Modules using this".

	    Configuration changes via the GUI had a few bugs related
	    to error handling, rollback and undo. A major re-write of
	    the reltool_server has been done in order to align the
	    way reltool_server updates and uses its state and tables
	    for all different kinds of configuration change. </p>
          <p>
	    All configuration changes (except undo) now cause a
	    re-read of the file system, meaning that if something has
	    changed in the file system it will be reflected in the
	    result of the configuration change.</p>
          <p>
	    When loading a new configuration file via the GUI, the
	    old configuration is now completely scratched, and only
	    the new is valid.</p>

          <p>
	    Some bug fixes related to the handling of escripts:
	    <list> <item> Reltool could not handle escripts with
	    inlined applications. This has been corrected. Inlined
	    applications will be visible in the GUI, but not possible
	    to include/exclude separately. </item> <item> Loading a
	    config which contains an escript via the GUI menu did not
	    produce the same result as when using the same
	    configuration at reltool start. Paths, version and label
	    could differ. This has been corrected. </item> <item>
	    Loading config with same escript (source) twice caused
	    reltool to add same module twice. This has been
	    corrected. </item> <item> Loading config with same
	    escript (inlined beam) twice caused reltool to fail
	    saying module is included by two different applications.
	    This has been corrected. </item> <item> Loading config
	    which in addition to an existing escript also adds
	    another escript, for which the name sorts before the
	    existing one, would cause reltool to fail saying
	    "Application name clash". This has been corrected.
	    </item> </list></p>

          <p>
	    Reltool would sometimes generate a .app file containing
	    <c>{start_phases,undefined}</c>, which would cause an
	    exception in systools at parse time. This has been
	    corrected so reltool now omits the <c>start_phases</c>
	    entry if the value is <c>undefined</c>. (Thanks to Juan
	    Jose Comellas)</p>
          <p>
	    In order to align with reltool, sasl will also omit
	    <c>start_phases</c> entries with value <c>undefined</c>
	    in .script files.</p>

	    A warning list is added to the sys window of the reltool
	    GUI. This list will continuously show all warnings

	    As a way of specifying one specific version of an
	    application, the following configuration parameter is
	    added on application level:</p>
          <p>
	    {lib_dir,Dir}, Dir = string()</p>
          <p>
	    This can be useful if the parent directory of the
	    application directory is not suitable to use as a lib dir
	    on system level.</p>

	    If a module was duplicated in the library directories
	    visible to reltool, and the configuration did not point
	    out which file to use, then reltool:start would always
	    fail. A pop-up is added which asks if you want to
	    continue with a safe and minimal configuration.</p>

	    wx would sometimes crash due to an empty radiobox on the

	    removed, and replaced by a listbox which will always
	    contain at least kernel and stdlib applications.</p>

	    The reltool module contained two seriously erroneous
	    specs which caused bogus warnings when dialyzing reltool
	    and some correct code of users. These were fixed (specs
	    for start_link/1 and eval_server/3)</p>

          <p>
            Added function <c>zip:foldl/3</c> to iterate over zip
            archives.</p>
          <p>
            Added functions to create and extract escripts. See

          <p>
            The undocumented function <c>escript:foldl/3</c> has been
            removed. The same functionality can be achieved with the
            more flexible functions <c>escript:extract/2</c> and
            <c>zip:foldl/3</c>.</p>
          <p>
            Record fields has been annotated with type info. Source
            files as been adapted to fit within 80 chars and trailing
            whitespace has been removed.</p>

            <p>A new escript, called <c>reltool</c>, has been
            introduced in order to simplify the usage of the reltool
            application from makefiles.</p>
            <p>The handling of applications included in releases has
            been improved. Applications that are required to be
            started before other applications in a release are now
            automatically included in the release. The <c>kernel</c>
            and <c>stdlib</c> applications are always included as
            they are mandatory.</p>
            <p>Applications that are (explicitly or implicitly)
            included in a release are now automatically included as
            if they were explicitly included with the incl_cond
            flag.</p>
            <p>A new <c>embedded_app_type</c> option has been
            introduced. It is intended to be used for embedded
            systems where all included applications must be loaded
            from the boot script, as these systems does not utilize
            dynamic code loading. If <c>embedded_app_type </c> is set
            to something else than <c>undefined</c>, all included
            applications will be included in both the release as well
            as in the boot script. If the <c>profile</c> is
            <c>embedded</c> the <c>embedded_app_type</c> option
            defaults to <c>load</c>.</p>
            <p>A new function called <c>reltool:get_status/1</c> has
            been introduced. It returns status about the
            configuration in the server.</p>
            <p>The API functions that may take <c>PidOrOptions</c> as
            input and actually gets <c>Options</c> does now print out
            warnings.</p>
            <p>The internal error handling has been improved. For
            example <c>{error,Reason}</c> is always returned in case
            of errors even when the server dies.</p>
            <p><c>app</c> and <c>appup</c> files has been added as
            well as a corresponding test suite.</p>
            <p>Various cleanups has been made in the code and in the
            documentation.</p>

                In the new release of Reltool (0.5) there is a severe bug
                that may cause your source files to be deleted. The bug
                is triggered when you generate a target system WITH
                archive files AND your library directories are given with
                absolute paths. (Library directories are given with the
                ERL_LIBS environment variable or with the lib_dirs
                configuration parameter.)</p>

              <p>
                Major improvements of the target system generation has
                been performed. Now it is possible to generate a
                relocatable target system that does not need to be
                re-installed if it is moved to a new location. Archive
                files are automatically generated. A detailed
                specification of the target system can be generated
                without actually creating the target system. Relocatable
                escripts are put in the bin directory of the target
                system. etc. etc.</p>
              <p>
                Some new functions has been introduced in the
                <c>reltool</c> module: <c>start/1, start_link/1,
                get_config/3, get_target_spec/1 and
                eval_target_spec/3</c>.</p>
              <p>
                Some new configuration parameters has been introduced:
                <c>profile, incl_sys_filters, excl_sys_filters,
                incl_app_filters, excl_app_filters, incl_archive_filters,
                excl_archive_filters, archive_opts, escript and
                relocatable</c>.</p>
              <p>
                Some parameters have been obsoleted and given new
                semantics: <c>incl_erts_dirs (incl_sys_filters),
                excl_erts_dirs (excl_sys_filters), incl_app_dirs
                (incl_app_filters), excl_app_dirs (excl_app_filters) and
                escripts (escript).</c></p>
