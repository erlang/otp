    <title>Internal form of messages</title>
    <p>We use the same internal form for both the binary and text
      encoding.  Our internal form of Megaco/H.248 messages is heavily
      influenced by the internal format used by ASN.1
      encoders/decoders:</p>
    <list type="bulleted">
      <item>
        <p>"SEQUENCE OF" is represented as a list.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>"CHOICE" is represented as a tagged tuple with size 2.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>"SEQUENCE" is represented as a record, defined in
          "megaco/include/megaco_message_v1.hrl".</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>"OPTIONAL" is represented as an ordinary field in a
          record which defaults to 'asn1_NOVALUE', meaning that the
          field has no value.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>"OCTET STRING" is represented as a list of unsigned integers.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>"ENUMERATED" is represented as a single atom.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>"BIT STRING" is represented as a list of atoms.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>"BOOLEAN" is represented as the atom 'true' or 'false'.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>"INTEGER" is represented as an integer.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>"IA5String" is represented as a list of integers,
          where each integer is the ASCII value of the corresponding
          character.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>"NULL" is represented as the atom 'NULL'.</p>
      </item>
    </list>
    <p>In order to fully understand the internal form you must get
      hold on a ASN.1 specification for the Megaco/H.248 protocol, 
      and apply the rules above.
      Please, see the documentation of the ASN.1 compiler in
      Erlang/OTP for more details of the semantics in mapping between
      ASN.1 and the corresponding internal form.</p>
    <p>Observe that the 'TerminationId' record is not used in the
      internal form. It has been replaced with a megaco_term_id record
      (defined in "megaco/include/megaco.hrl").</p>

    <title>The different encodings</title>
    <p>The Megaco/H.248 standard defines both a plain text encoding
      and a binary encoding (ASN.1 BER) and we have implemented
      encoders and decoders for both. We do in fact supply five
      different encoding/decoding modules.</p>
    <p>In the text encoding, implementors have the choice of using a
      mix of short and long keywords. It is also possible to add white
      spaces to improve readability. We use the term compact for text
      messages with the shortest possible keywords and no optional
      white spaces, and the term pretty for a well indented text
      format using long keywords and an indentation style like the
      text examples in the Megaco/H.248 specification).</p>
    <p>Here follows an example of a text message to give a feeling
      of the difference between the pretty and compact versions of
      text messages. First the pretty, well indented version with long
      keywords:</p>
    <pre>
   MEGACO/1 [124.124.124.222]
   Transaction = 9998 {
           Context = - {
                   ServiceChange = ROOT {
                           Services {
                                   Method = Restart,
                                   ServiceChangeAddress = 55555,
                                   Profile = ResGW/1,
                                   Reason = "901 Cold Boot"
                           }
                   }
           }
   }    </pre>
    <p>Then the compact version without indentation and with short keywords:</p>
    <pre>
 
   !/1 [124.124.124.222]
   T=9998{C=-{SC=ROOT{SV{MT=RS,AD=55555,PF=ResGW/1,RE="901 Cold Boot"}}}}    </pre>
    <p>And the programmers view of the same message.
      First a list of ActionRequest records are constructed and
      then it is sent with one of the send functions in the API:</p>
    <pre>
  Prof = #'ServiceChangeProfile'{profileName = "resgw", version = 1},
  Parm = #'ServiceChangeParm'{serviceChangeMethod  = restart,
                              serviceChangeAddress = {portNumber, 55555},
                              serviceChangeReason  = "901 Cold Boot",
                              serviceChangeProfile = Prof},
  Req = #'ServiceChangeRequest'{terminationID = [?megaco_root_termination_id],
                                serviceChangeParms = Parm},
  Actions = [#'ActionRequest'{contextId = ?megaco_null_context_id,
                              commandRequests = {serviceChangeReq, Req}}],
  megaco:call(ConnHandle, Actions, Config).    </pre>
    <p>And finally a print-out of the entire internal form:</p>
    <pre>
  {'MegacoMessage',
   asn1_NOVALUE,
   {'Message',
    1,
    {ip4Address,{'IP4Address', [124,124,124,222], asn1_NOVALUE}},

    <title>Handling megaco versions</title>
    <p>Since the version 3 implemented, in this version of the Megaco 
      application, is preliminary, it is necessary to have a way
      to handle different version 3 implementations. For this reason
      the encoding config option <c><![CDATA[{version3, version3()}]]></c> has been 
      introduced. This option, if present, has to be <em>first</em> in the 
      encoding config list. Version 1 and 2 codec's ignore this option, if 
      found. </p>
    <code type="none"><![CDATA[
version3() -> prev3a | prev3b | prev3c | v3    ]]></code>
    <list type="bulleted">

      </item>
      <item>
        <p><em>prev3b</em></p>
        <p>Preliminary version 3, based on TD-33, but text encoding 
          updated with the final solution for priority in

      </item>
      <item>
        <p><em>v3</em></p>
        <p>Full version 3. Including segmentation. This is the default
          version 3 variant (i.e. if a version 3 messages is to be 
          encoded/decoded and no version3 encoding config is found, 
          then v3 is assumed).</p>
      </item>
    </list>
    <p>There are two ways to handle the different megaco encoding versions.
      Either using <em>dynamic version detection</em> (only valid for
      for incoming messages) or by <em>explicit version</em> setting in 
      the connection info.</p>
    <p>For incoming messages:</p>
    <list type="bulleted">
      <item>
        <p>Dynamic version detection</p>
        <p>Set the protocol version in the megaco_receive_handle to 
          <c><![CDATA[dynamic]]></c> (this is the default).
          <br></br>This works for those codecs that support partial decode of the 
          version, currently <em>text</em>, and ber_bin 
          (<c><![CDATA[megaco_binary_encoder]]></c> and <c><![CDATA[megaco_ber_bin_encoder]]></c>). 
          <br></br>This way the decoder will detect which version is used and 
          then use the proper decoder. </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>Explicit version</p>
        <p>Explicitly set the actual protocol version in the 
          megaco_receive_handle.
          <br></br>Start with version 1. When the initial service change has been 
          performed and version 2 has been negotiated, upgrade the 
          megaco_receive_handle of the transport process (control_pid) to 
          version 2.

          <br></br>Note that if <c><![CDATA[udp]]></c> is used, the same transport process 
          could be used for several connections. This could make upgrading 
          impossible.
          <br></br>For codecs that does not support partial decode of the version, 
          currently <c><![CDATA[megaco_ber_encoder]]></c>, <c><![CDATA[megaco_per_encoder]]></c>
