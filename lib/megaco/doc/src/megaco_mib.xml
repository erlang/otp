  <section>
    <title>Intro</title>
    <p>The Megaco mib is as of yet not standardized and our
      implementation is based on
      <em>draft-ietf-megaco-mib-04.txt</em>.  Almost all of the mib
      cannot easily be implemented by the megaco application. Instead
      these things should be implemented by a user (of the megaco
      application). </p>
    <p>So what part of the mib is implemented? Basically the relevant
      statistic counters of the <em>MedGwyGatewayStatsEntry</em>.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Statistics counters</title>
    <p>The implementation of the statistic counters is
      lightweight. I.e.  the statistic counters are handled
      separately by different entities of the application. For
      instance our two transport module(s) (see <seealso marker="megaco_tcp#stats">megaco_tcp</seealso> and <seealso marker="megaco_udp#stats">megaco_udp</seealso>) maintain their
      own counters and the application engine (see <seealso marker="megaco#stats">megaco</seealso>) maintain its own
      counters.</p>
    <p>This also means that if a user implement their own transport
      service then it has to maintain its own statistics.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Distribution</title>
    <p>Each megaco application maintains its own set of counters. So
      in a large (distributed) MG/MGC it could be necessary to
      collect the statistics from several nodes (each) running the
      megaco application (only one of them with the transport).</p>
