          <p>The Erlang Emacs mode now properly handles strings that
            have $ or ^ as the last character.</p>

        </item>
        <item>
          <p><c>xref</c>: The unresolved arity (-1) is now recognized
            in analyses and queries.</p>

        <item>
          <p><c>cover</c> does no longer hang if an interface function
            is called on a remote node - it returns
            <c>{error,not_main_node}</c>.</p>
          <p>Own Id: OTP-5031</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p><c>fprof</c>: Time spent in the last function in a chain,
            i.e. a function which did not call another function, and
            the time when a process was scheduled out, was charged on
            the above function. This resulted in own time in many
            cases being bigger than acc time since the time a process
            was scheduled out was charged on the function from which
            the process was scheduled out. This is now corrected.</p>

        <item>
          <p>Previous patch from open source messed up \M-q so part of
            that patch was backed out.</p>
          <p>Own Id: OTP-5074</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p><c>cover</c>: Added "Exclude Included Functions". If
            "real code" is included in a modules which is cover
            compiled, there will be no bumps for lines in the
            included file. Earlier this would cause faulty bumps for
            lines in the module, i.e. if the code was on line 4 in
            the included file it would produce a bump for line 4 in
            the module. Lines in included files are now just
            disregarded.</p>

          <p>Added support for try-catch to the Erlang mode for Emacs.
            However there are still some known problems with some of
            the more advanced variants especially including separate
            of-clauses.</p>

        <item>
          <p>Improvments for support of Emacs 21 contributed by Dave
            Love. The bulk of the changes are actually cosmetic
            commentary/doc fixes. The significant ones make it play
            better with Emacs 21 with up-to-date facilities. In
            particular, support for compilation error messages from
            an inferior erl (as opposed to batch compilation) works
            in the released Emacs 21, and currently with the
            development Emacs.</p>
          <p>Own Id: OTP-5019</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>Added a skeletons for an Erlang test-suite for both the
            ts-frontend and the ct-frontend (this frontend is
            Ericsson internal). Also altered some of the old
            skeletons to get a uniform look and feel.</p>

          <p>The Erlang mode for Emacs now supports the new guard
            <c>is_boolean</c>.</p>

          <p>Totally rewritten the interface for WebCover. Can now
            compile both <c>.erl</c> and <c>.beam</c> files and
            export/import cover data.</p>

        <item>
          <p>Erlang mode for Emacs: Fixed so that the generation of new
            function clauses works also for guarded functions.</p>

        <item>
          <p>Erlang mode for Emacs: Fixed so that you do not get
            the error message "unbalanced parenthesis" when indenting
            correct code including bit syntax.</p>

          <p>Erlang mode for Emacs: Now handles the fact that a function
            argument may be a guard expression. (That is useful when
            writing test case code.)</p>

        <item>
          <p>Added functions <c>cover:start(Nodes)</c> and
            <c>cover:stop(Nodes)</c>. Cover compiled modules will be
            loaded on all nodes added with <c>cover:start(Nodes)</c>.
            <c>cover:stop(Nodes)</c> will collect coverage data from
            the stopped nodes and merge it with data collected on
            the main (controller) node.</p>
          <p><c>cover:analyse/1,2,3</c> and
            <c>cover:analyse_to_file/1,2,3</c> will also collect data
            from all nodes before analysing.</p>

        <item>
          <p>The module attribute tag <c>deprecated</c> is used by
            <c>xref</c> to find calls to deprecated functions.
            The <c>m/1</c>, <c>d/1</c>, and <c>analyze/2,3</c> functions
            have been updated to return calls to deprecated functions.
            See also <c>xref(3)</c> for more details.</p>
          <p>Own Id: OTP-4695</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>Added functions <c>cover:compile_beam/1</c> and
            <c>cover:compile_beam_directory/0,1</c>. These functions use
            abstract code from existing beam files when cover compiling.</p>
          <p>Added option <c>html</c> to
            <c>cover:analyse_to_file/1,2,3</c>. Instead of plain text,
            a HTML file is generated with all uncovered lines colored
            red.</p>
          <p>Added functions <c>cover:export/1,2</c> and
            <c>cover:import/1</c>. These functions can be used to export
            current coverage data to a file, and then import the data
            in a later session. Data can be exported for one single
            module or for all currently cover compiled modules.</p>

        <item>
          <p>The interface for the <c>instrument</c> module has been
            slightly changed. Also some new functionality has been
            added. See <c>instrument(3)</c> for more information.</p>
