	    If a module includes eunit.hrl, a parse transform adds
	    the function test/0 on line 0 in the module. A bug in
	    OTP-18.0 caused cover:analyse_to_file/1 to fail to insert
	    cover data in the output file when line 0 existed in the
	    cover data table. This is now corrected.</p>

          <p>
	    In order to improve performance of the cover tool, new
	    functions are added for cover compilation and analysis on
	    multiple files. This allows for more parallelisation.</p>
          <p>
	    Some improvements of the data base access is also done in
	    order to improve the performance when analysing and
	    resetting cover data.</p>
          <p>
	    Minor incompatibility: An error reason from
	    analyse_to_file is changed from no_source_code_found to
	    {no_source_code_found,Module}.</p>

          <p>
	    Earlier, supervisor flags and child specs were given as

	    it is now also allowed to give these parameters as maps,
	    see <seealso
	    marker="stdlib:supervisor#sup_flags">sup_flags</seealso>

	    A new function, cover:flush(Nodes), is added which will
	    fetch data from remote nodes without stopping cover on
	    those nodes. This is used by test_server and common_test
	    when it is safe to assume that the node will be
	    terminated after the test anyway. The purpose is to avoid
	    processes crashing when re-loading the original beam if
	    the processes is still running old code.</p>
          <p>
	    Remote nodes will now continue to count code coverage if
	    the connection to the main node is broken. Earlier, a
	    broken connection would cause the cover_server on the
	    remote node to die and thus any still cover compiled
	    modules would cause process crash when trying to insert
	    cover data in ets tables that used to exist on the
	    cover_server. The new functionality also involves
	    synchronization with the main node if the nodes are
	    reconnected.</p>

	    Makefiles in erts, hipe and tools have been corrected to
	    enable parallel make, i.e MAKEFLAGS=-jX where X is the
	    parallelity number. As a result of this dependencies were
	    corrected since that is what is needed for parallel make
	    to work.</p>

	    [cover] fix leftover {'DOWN', ..} msg in callers queue</p>
          <p>
	    After stopping cover with cover:stop() there could still
	    be a {'DOWN',...} leftover message in the calling
	    process's message queue. This unexpected leftover could
	    be eliminated if erlang:demonitor/2 with option flush
	    would be used in certain points</p>

          <p>
	    Update erlang-flymake to recognize the "deps" folder as
	    an include directory. This makes erlang-flymake
	    compatible with the rebar dependency management tool's
	    default folder structure, which puts included
	    dependencies in "deps".(Thanks to Kevin Albrecht)</p>

	    <p>Variables are now now allowed in '<c>fun M:F/A</c>' as
	    suggested by Richard O'Keefe in EEP-23.</p>
	    <p>The representation of '<c>fun M:F/A</c>' in the
	    abstract format has been changed in an incompatible way.
	    Tools that directly read or manipulate the abstract
	    format (such as parse transforms) may need to be updated.
	    The compiler can handle both the new and the old format
	    (i.e. extracting the abstract format from a pre-R15 BEAM
	    file and compiling it using compile:forms/1,2 will work).
	    The <c>syntax_tools</c> application can also handle both
	    formats.</p>

	    Tuple funs (a two-element tuple with a module name and a

	    Teach the emacs mode to compile yecc and leex files</p>
          <p>
	    If visiting a .yrl or .xrl file in emacs with
	    erlang-mode, then the `erlang-compile' function (normally
	    bound to C-c C-k), now knows how to compile yecc and leex
	    files, and then, if that compilation succeeds, also
	    compiles the resulting .erl files.</p>
          <p>
	    Also introduce a `erlang-compile-command-function-alist'
	    to make it possible to hook in other functions for
	    computing compilation commands/expressions, depending on
	    file name. (Thanks to Tomas Abrahamsson )</p>

	    This change removes the unnecessary checks on the files

	    to be done in compile:file, where the error messages are
	    produced. It does not affect the return value.</p>

	    add user specified compiler options on form reloading</p>
          <p>
	    In order to be able to test non-exported functions from
	    another (test) module it is necessary to compile the
	    specific module (at least during the test phase) with the
	    export_all compiler option. This allows complete
	    separation of testing and productive code. At the moment
	    it is not possible to combine this with a test code
	    coverage using the cover module. The problem is that when
	    cover compiling a module using cover:compile_* the code
	    is reloaded into the emulator omitting/filtering the
	    passed user options. In my example above the export_all
	    option would be removed and the non-exported functions
	    cannot be called any more. (Thanks to Tobias Schlager)</p>

	    Inhibit electric newline after "-&gt;" when inside a type
	    spec</p>
          <p>
	    The Erlang mode for Emacs inserts a newline after every
	    "-&gt;", which saves you one keystroke when writing a
	    function, but that is inappropriate when writing a type
	    spec, as you'd normally keep the spec on one line. This
	    change inhibits the automatic insertion when the current
	    line starts with "-spec" or "-type".(Thanks to Magnus
	    Henoch)</p>

	    Declare indentation options as "safe" in erlang-mode for
	    Emacs</p>
          <p>
	    Emacs has a facility for setting options on a per-file
	    basis based on comments in the source file. By default,
	    all options are considered "unsafe", and the user is
	    queried before the variable is set. This patch declares
	    the variables erlang-indent-level, erlang-indent-guard
	    and erlang-argument-indent to be safe, if the value
	    specified in the source file is valid.</p>
          <p>
	    Such declarations usually look like this:</p>
          <p>
	    %% -*- erlang-indent-level: 2 -*-</p>
          <p>
	    and appear on the first line of the file. (thanks to

        Add lock profiling tool.</p>
          <p>
        The Lock profiling tool, lcnt, can make use of the

        with this feature enabled.</p>
          <p>

        - Add erts_debug:lock_counters({copy_save, bool()}). This
        option enables or disables statistics saving for
        destroyed processes and ets-tables. Enabling this might
        consume a lot of memory.</p>

          <p>Fixed some bugs in <c>make</c>:</p>
          <p><c>make:files/1,2</c> can now handle a file in another

          <p>When specifying a file name including the <c>.erl</c>
            extension in <c>Emakefile</c>, <c>make:all/0,1</c> looked
            for the object code in the wrong place.</p>
          <p>When specifying a file name including the <c>.erl</c>
            extension in <c>Emakefile</c> and some compile options
            for the file, <c>make:files/0,1</c> did not use the

          <p><c>cover</c>: When <c>cover:stop()</c> was called,
            the cover compiled code was not unloaded (as stated in
            the documentation) but simply marked as 'old'. This
            meant that processes lingering in (or with funs
            referencing to) the cover compiled code would survive
            even when the cover server and its ETS tables was
            terminated.</p>
          <p>Now the cover compiled code is unloaded, meaning that
            processes lingering in/with references to it will be
            killed when <c>cover:stop</c> is called, instead of
            later crashing with <c>badarg</c> when trying to bump
            counters in ETS tables no longer existing.</p>

          <p>It is now possible to encrypt the debug information in
            beam files, to help keep the source code secret. See
            <c>compile(3)</c> for how to provide the key for encrypting,
            and <c>beam_lib(3)</c> for how to provide the key for
            decryption so that tools such as Debugger, <c>xref</c>, or
            <c>cover</c> can be used.</p>
          <p>The <c>beam_lib:chunks/2</c> functions now accepts an
            additional chunk type '<c>compile_info</c>' to retrieve
            the compilation information directly as a term. (Thanks
