	    Teach the emacs mode to compile yecc and leex files</p>
          <p>
	    If visiting a .yrl or .xrl file in emacs with
	    erlang-mode, then the `erlang-compile' function (normally
	    bound to C-c C-k), now knows how to compile yecc and leex
	    files, and then, if that compilation succeeds, also
	    compiles the resulting .erl files.</p>
          <p>
	    Also introduce a `erlang-compile-command-function-alist'
	    to make it possible to hook in other functions for
	    computing compilation commands/expressions, depending on
	    file name. (Thanks to Tomas Abrahamsson )</p>

	    Change make:files to behave more like erlc</p>
          <p>
	    This change removes the unnecessary checks on the files
	    when make:files is called and allows the error checking
	    to be done in compile:file, where the error messages are
	    produced. It does not affect the return value.</p>

          <p>
	    add user specified compiler options on form reloading</p>
          <p>
	    In order to be able to test non-exported functions from
	    another (test) module it is necessary to compile the
	    specific module (at least during the test phase) with the
	    export_all compiler option. This allows complete
	    separation of testing and productive code. At the moment
	    it is not possible to combine this with a test code
	    coverage using the cover module. The problem is that when
	    cover compiling a module using cover:compile_* the code
	    is reloaded into the emulator omitting/filtering the
	    passed user options. In my example above the export_all
	    option would be removed and the non-exported functions
	    cannot be called any more. (Thanks to Tobias Schlager)</p>

	    Inhibit electric newline after "-&gt;" when inside a type
	    spec</p>
          <p>
	    The Erlang mode for Emacs inserts a newline after every
	    "-&gt;", which saves you one keystroke when writing a
	    function, but that is inappropriate when writing a type
	    spec, as you'd normally keep the spec on one line. This
	    change inhibits the automatic insertion when the current
	    line starts with "-spec" or "-type".(Thanks to Magnus
	    Henoch)</p>

	    Add a check logic to prevent file descriptor leak</p>
          <p>
	    cover module handle files as raw in export and import.
	    Assert counts of ports are the same at the beginning and
	    at the end of the test case.(Thanks to Shunichi
	    Shinohara)</p>

	    Declare indentation options as "safe" in erlang-mode for
	    Emacs</p>
          <p>
	    Emacs has a facility for setting options on a per-file
	    basis based on comments in the source file. By default,
	    all options are considered "unsafe", and the user is
	    queried before the variable is set. This patch declares
	    the variables erlang-indent-level, erlang-indent-guard
	    and erlang-argument-indent to be safe, if the value
	    specified in the source file is valid.</p>
          <p>
	    Such declarations usually look like this:</p>
          <p>
	    %% -*- erlang-indent-level: 2 -*-</p>
          <p>
	    and appear on the first line of the file. (thanks to
	    Magnus Henoch)</p>

	    Cover has been improved to take less memory and allow
	    parallel analysis of cover data. Data collection from
	    nodes is now done in parallel and it is now possible to
	    issue multiple analyse and analyse_to_file requests at
	    the same time. A new function call async_analyse_to_file
	    has also been introduced, see the documentation for more
	    details.</p>

	    better. In measurements we saw speed-ups compared to the
	    old eprof ranging from 6 times (for sequential code that
	    only uses one scheduler/core) up to 84 times (for
	    parallel code that uses 8 cores).</p>
	    <p>Note: The API for the <c>eprof</c> has been cleaned up
	    and extended. See the documentation.</p>

        Add lock profiling tool.</p>
          <p>
        The Lock profiling tool, lcnt, can make use of the
        internal lock statistics when the runtime system is built
        with this feature enabled.</p>
          <p>
        This provides a mechanism to examine potential lock
        bottlenecks within the runtime itself.</p>
          <p>
        - Add erts_debug:lock_counters({copy_save, bool()}). This
        option enables or disables statistics saving for
        destroyed processes and ets-tables. Enabling this might
        consume a lot of memory.</p>
          <p>
        - Add id-numbering for lock classes which is otherwise
        undefined.</p>

            expressions (the body called <c>Exprs</c> in the Reference

          <p>Fixed some bugs in <c>make</c>:</p>
          <p><c>make:files/1,2</c> can now handle a file in another
            directory as argument, similar to <c>make:all/0,1</c>.</p>
          <p>When specifying a file name including the <c>.erl</c>
            extension in <c>Emakefile</c>, <c>make:all/0,1</c> looked
            for the object code in the wrong place.</p>
          <p>When specifying a file name including the <c>.erl</c>
            extension in <c>Emakefile</c> and some compile options
            for the file, <c>make:files/0,1</c> did not use the
            options as it should do.</p>

          <p><c>cover</c>: When <c>cover:stop()</c> was called,
            the cover compiled code was not unloaded (as stated in
            the documentation) but simply marked as 'old'. This
            meant that processes lingering in (or with funs
            referencing to) the cover compiled code would survive
            even when the cover server and its ETS tables was
            terminated.</p>
          <p>Now the cover compiled code is unloaded, meaning that
            processes lingering in/with references to it will be
            killed when <c>cover:stop</c> is called, instead of
            later crashing with <c>badarg</c> when trying to bump
            counters in ETS tables no longer existing.</p>

          <p>Emacs: <c>erlang-man-function</c> and

          <p>It is now possible to encrypt the debug information in
            beam files, to help keep the source code secret. See
            <c>compile(3)</c> for how to provide the key for encrypting,
            and <c>beam_lib(3)</c> for how to provide the key for
            decryption so that tools such as Debugger, <c>xref</c>, or
            <c>cover</c> can be used.</p>
          <p>The <c>beam_lib:chunks/2</c> functions now accepts an
            additional chunk type '<c>compile_info</c>' to retrieve
            the compilation information directly as a term. (Thanks
            to Tobias Lindahl.)</p>
