## The below bash magic captures the output of stderr into OUTPUT while still printing
## everything we get to stdout and stderr. This is done by:

## 1. duplicating the stdout (1) and stderr (2) streams to fd 3 and 4 respectively.
exec 3>&1 4>&2

## Running the command where we redirect stderr to fd 1 and stdout to fd 3.
## We then use tee on the stderr (which is now fd 1) to print that to fd 4
