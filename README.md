Erlang/OTP
==========

**Erlang** is a programming language used to build massively scalable soft
real-time systems with requirements on high availability. Some of its
uses are in telecom, banking, e-commerce, computer telephony and
instant messaging. Erlang's runtime system has built-in support for
concurrency, distribution and fault tolerance.

**OTP** is set of Erlang libraries and design principles providing
middle-ware to develop these systems. It includes its own distributed
database, applications to interface towards other languages, debugging
and release handling tools.

ERTS and BEAM
-------------
**BEAM** is the name of the virtual machine where all Erlang code is executed.
Every compiled Erlang file has the suffix .beam. The virtual machine
is sometimes referred to as the emulator.

**ERTS** is the Erlang Runtime System where the BEAM, kernel and
standard libraries amongst others are included.
