  <p>This section describes the <c><![CDATA[erl_crash.dump]]></c> file
    generated upon abnormal exit of the Erlang runtime system.</p>

  <note>
    <p>The Erlang crash dump had a major facelift in Erlang/OTP R9C. The
      information in this section is therefore not directly applicable for
      older dumps. However, if you use <seeerl marker="observer:crashdump_viewer">
      <c>crashdump_viewer(3)</c></seeerl> on older dumps,
      the crash dumps are translated into a format similar to this.</p>
  </note>

  <p>The system writes the crash dump in the current directory of
    the emulator or in the file pointed out by the environment variable
    (whatever that means on the current operating system)
    <c>ERL_CRASH_DUMP</c>. For a crash dump to be written, a
    writable file system must be mounted.</p>

  <p>Crash dumps are written mainly for one of two reasons: either the
    built-in function <c><![CDATA[erlang:halt/1]]></c> is called explicitly
    with a string argument from running Erlang code, or the runtime
    system has detected an error that cannot be handled. The most
    usual reason that the system cannot handle the error is that the
    cause is external limitations, such as running out of memory. A
    crash dump caused by an internal error can be caused by the system
    reaching limits in the emulator itself (like the number of atoms
    in the system, or too many simultaneous ETS tables). Usually the
    emulator or the operating system can be reconfigured to avoid the
    crash, which is why interpreting the crash dump correctly is
    important.</p>

  <p>On systems that support OS signals, it is also possible to stop
    the runtime system and generate a crash dump by sending the <c>SIGUSR1</c>
    signal.</p>

  <p>The Erlang crash dump is a readable text file, but it can be difficult
    to read. Using the Crashdump Viewer tool in the
    <c><![CDATA[Observer]]></c> application simplifies the task. This is a
    wx-widget-based tool for browsing Erlang crash dumps.</p>

  <section>
    <marker id="general_info"></marker>
    <title>General Information</title>
    <p>The first part of the crash dump shows the following:</p>

    <list type="bulleted">
      <item>The creation time for the dump</item>
      <item>A slogan indicating the reason for the dump</item>
      <item>The system version of the node from which the dump originates</item>
      <item>The number of atoms in the atom table</item>
      <item>The runtime system thread that caused the crash dump</item>
    </list>

    <section>
      <title>Reasons for Crash Dumps (Slogan)</title>
      <p>The reason for the dump is shown in the beginning of the file as:</p>

      <pre>
Slogan: &lt;reason&gt;</pre>

      <p>If the system is halted by the BIF
        <c><![CDATA[erlang:halt/1]]></c>, the slogan is the string parameter
        passed to the BIF, otherwise it is a description generated by
        the emulator or the (Erlang) kernel. Normally the message
        is enough to understand the problem, but
        some messages are described here. Notice that the
        suggested reasons for the crash are <em>only suggestions</em>.
        The exact reasons for the errors can vary
        depending on the local applications and the underlying
        operating system.</p>

        <tag><em>&lt;A&gt;: Cannot allocate &lt;N&gt; bytes of memory (of type
           "&lt;T&gt;")</em></tag>
        <item>
          <p>The system has run out of memory. &lt;A&gt; is the allocator that
            failed to allocate memory, &lt;N&gt; is the number of bytes that
            &lt;A&gt; tried to allocate, and &lt;T&gt; is the memory block
            type that the memory was needed for. The most common case is
            that a process stores huge amounts of data. In this case
            &lt;T&gt; is most often <c><![CDATA[heap]]></c>,
            <c><![CDATA[old_heap]]></c>, <c><![CDATA[heap_frag]]></c>, or
            <c><![CDATA[binary]]></c>. For more information on allocators, see

          <p>Same as above except that memory was reallocated
            instead of allocated when the system ran out of memory.</p>

        <item>
          <p>The number of file descriptors for sockets
            exceeds 1024 (Unix only). The limit on file descriptors in
            some Unix flavors can be set to over 1024, but only 1024
            sockets/pipes can be used simultaneously by Erlang (because of
            limitations in the Unix <c><![CDATA[select]]></c> call). The number
            of open regular files is not affected by this.</p>
        </item>
        <tag><em>Received SIGUSR1</em></tag>
        <item>
          <p>Sending the <c>SIGUSR1</c> signal to an Erlang machine (Unix only)
            forces a crash dump. This slogan reflects that the Erlang machine
            crash-dumped because of receiving that signal.</p>
        </item>
        <tag><em>Kernel pid terminated (&lt;Who&gt;) (&lt;Exit
          reason&gt;)</em></tag>
        <item>
          <p>The kernel supervisor has detected a failure, usually that the
            <c><![CDATA[application_controller]]></c> has shut down
            (<c><![CDATA[Who]]></c> = <c><![CDATA[application_controller]]></c>,
            <c><![CDATA[Why]]></c> = <c><![CDATA[shutdown]]></c>).
            The application controller
            can have shut down for many reasons, the most usual
            is that the node name of the distributed Erlang node is
            already in use. A complete supervisor tree "crash" (that is,
            the top supervisors have exited) gives about the same
            result. This message comes from the Erlang code and not from
            the virtual machine itself. It is always because of some
            failure in an application, either within OTP or a
            "user-written" one. Looking at the error log for your
            application is probably the first step to take.</p>
        </item>
        <tag><em>Init terminating in do_boot ()</em></tag>
        <item>
          <p>The primitive Erlang boot sequence was terminated, most probably
            because the boot script has errors or cannot be read. This is
            usually a configuration error; the system can have been started
            with a faulty <c><![CDATA[-boot]]></c> parameter or with a boot
            script from the wrong OTP version.</p>
        </item>
        <tag><em>Could not start kernel pid (&lt;Who&gt;) ()</em></tag>
        <item>
          <p>One of the kernel processes could not start. This is probably
            because of faulty arguments (like errors in a
            <c><![CDATA[-config]]></c> argument)
            or faulty configuration files. Check that all files are in
            their correct location and that the configuration files (if
            any) are not damaged. Usually messages are also
            written to the controlling terminal and/or the error log
            explaining what is wrong.</p>
        </item>
      </taglist>

      <p>Other errors than these can occur, as the
        <c><![CDATA[erlang:halt/1]]></c> BIF can generate any message. If the
        message is not generated by the BIF and does not occur in the
        list above, it can be because of an error in the emulator. There
        can however be unusual messages, not mentioned here, which
        are still connected to an application failure. There is much
        more information available, so a thorough reading of the
        crash dump can reveal the crash reason. The size of processes,
        the number of ETS tables, and the Erlang data on each process
        stack can be useful to find the problem.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Number of Atoms</title>
      <p>The number of atoms in the system at the time of the crash is
        shown as <em>Atoms: &lt;number&gt;</em>. Some ten thousands atoms is
        perfectly normal, but more can indicate that the BIF
        <c><![CDATA[erlang:list_to_atom/1]]></c> is used to generate many
        <em>different</em> atoms dynamically, which is never a good idea.</p>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <marker id="scheduler"></marker>
    <title>Scheduler Information</title>
    <p>Under the tag <em>=scheduler</em> is shown information about the current
      state and statistics of the schedulers in the runtime system. On
      operating systems that allow suspension of other threads, the
      data within this section reflects what the runtime system looks like
      when a crash occurs.</p>

    <p>The following fields can exist for a process:</p>

    <taglist>
      <tag><em>=scheduler:id</em></tag>
      <item>
        <p>Heading. States the scheduler identifier.</p>
      </item>
      <tag><em>Scheduler Sleep Info Flags</em></tag>
      <item>
        <p>If empty, the scheduler was doing some work.
          If not empty, the scheduler is either in some state of sleep,
          or suspended.</p>
      </item>
      <tag><em>Scheduler Sleep Info Aux Work</em></tag>
      <item>
        <p>If not empty, a scheduler internal auxiliary work is scheduled
          to be done.</p>
      </item>
      <tag><em>Current Port</em></tag>
      <item>
        <p>The port identifier of the port that is currently
          executed by the scheduler.</p>
      </item>
      <tag><em>Current Process</em></tag>
      <item>
        <p>The process identifier of the process that is currently
          executed by the scheduler. If there is such a process, this entry is
          followed by the <em>State</em>, <em>Internal State</em>,
          <em>Program Counter</em>, and <em>CP</em> of that same process.
          The entries are described in section
          <seeguide marker="#processes">Process Information</seeguide>.</p>
        <p>Notice that this is a snapshot of what the entries are exactly when
          the crash dump is starting to be generated. Therefore they are most
          likely different (and more telling) than the entries for the same
          processes found in the <em>=proc</em> section. If there is no
          currently running process, only the <em>Current Process</em> entry is
          shown.</p>
      </item>
      <tag><em>Current Process Limited Stack Trace</em></tag>
      <item>
        <p>This entry is shown only if there is a current process. It is
          similar to <seeguide marker="#proc_data">
          <em>=proc_stack</em></seeguide>, except that only the function frames
          are shown (that is, the stack variables are omitted).
          Also, only the top and bottom part of the stack are shown. If the
          stack is small (&lt; 512 slots), the entire stack is shown. Otherwise
          the entry <em>skipping ## slots</em> is shown, where <c>##</c>
          is replaced by the number of slots that has been skipped.</p>
      </item>
      <tag><em>Run Queue</em></tag>
      <item>
        <p>Shows statistics about how many processes and ports
          of different priorities are scheduled on this scheduler.</p>
      </item>
      <tag><em>** crashed **</em></tag>
      <item>
        <p>This entry is normally not shown. It signifies that getting the rest
          of the information about this scheduler failed for some reason.</p>
      </item>
    </taglist>
  </section>

  <section>
    <marker id="memory"></marker>
    <title>Memory Information</title>
    <p>Under the tag <em>=memory</em> is shown information similar
      to what can be obtained on a living node with
      <seemfa marker="erts:erlang#memory/0">
      <c>erlang:memory()</c></seemfa>.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <marker id="internal_tables"></marker>
    <title>Internal Table Information</title>
    <p>Under the tags <em>=hash_table:&lt;table_name&gt;</em> and
      <em>=index_table:&lt;table_name&gt;</em> is shown internal
      tables. These are mostly of interest for runtime system developers.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <marker id="allocated_areas"></marker>
    <title>Allocated Areas</title>
    <p>Under the tag <em>=allocated_areas</em> is shown information
      similar to what can be obtained on a living node with
      <seeerl marker="erts:erlang#system_info_allocated_areas">
      <c>erlang:system_info(allocated_areas)</c></seeerl>.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <marker id="allocator"></marker>
    <title>Allocator</title>
    <p>Under the tag <em>=allocator:&lt;A&gt;</em> is shown
      various information about allocator &lt;A&gt;. The information
      is similar to what can be obtained on a living node with
      <seeerl marker="erts:erlang#system_info_allocator_tuple">
      <c>erlang:system_info({allocator, &lt;A&gt;})</c></seeerl>.
      For more information, see also

  </section>

  <section>
    <marker id="processes"></marker>
    <title>Process Information</title>
    <p>The Erlang crashdump contains a listing of each living Erlang
      process in the system. The following fields can exist for a process:</p>

    <taglist>
      <tag><em>=proc:&lt;pid&gt;</em></tag>
      <item>
        <p>Heading. States the process identifier.</p>
      </item>
      <tag><em>State</em></tag>
      <item>
        <p>The state of the process. This can be one of the following:</p>
        <taglist>
          <tag><em>Scheduled</em></tag>
          <item>The process was scheduled to run
            but is currently not running ("in the run queue").</item>
          <tag><em>Waiting</em></tag>
          <item>The process was waiting for
            something (in <c><![CDATA[receive]]></c>).</item>
          <tag><em>Running</em></tag>
          <item>The process was currently running.
            If the BIF <c><![CDATA[erlang:halt/1]]></c> was called, this was
            the process calling it.</item>
          <tag><em>Exiting</em></tag>
          <item>The process was on its way to exit.</item>
          <tag><em>Garbing</em></tag>
          <item>This is bad luck, the process was
            garbage collecting when the crash dump was written. The rest
            of the information for this process is limited.</item>
          <tag><em>Suspended</em></tag>
          <item>The process is suspended, either
            by the BIF <c><![CDATA[erlang:suspend_process/1]]></c> or because
            it tries to write to a busy port.</item>
        </taglist>
      </item>
      <tag><em>Registered name</em></tag>
      <item>
        <p>The registered name of the process, if any.</p>
      </item>
      <tag><em>Spawned as</em></tag>
      <item>
        <p>The entry point of the process, that is, what function was
          referenced in the <c><![CDATA[spawn]]></c> or
          <c><![CDATA[spawn_link]]></c> call that
          started the process.</p>
      </item>
      <tag><em>Last scheduled in for | Current call</em></tag>
      <item>
        <p>The current function of the process. These fields do not
          always exist.</p>
      </item>
      <tag><em>Spawned by</em></tag>
      <item>
        <p>The parent of the process, that is, the process that executed
          <c><![CDATA[spawn]]></c> or <c><![CDATA[spawn_link]]></c>.</p>
      </item>
      <tag><em>Started</em></tag>
      <item>
        <p>The date and time when the process was started.</p>
      </item>
      <tag><em>Message queue length</em></tag>
      <item>
        <p>The number of messages in the process' message queue.</p>
      </item>
      <tag><em>Number of heap fragments</em></tag>
      <item>
        <p>The number of allocated heap fragments.</p>
      </item>
      <tag><em>Heap fragment data</em></tag>
      <item>
        <p>Size of fragmented heap data, in words. This is data either
          created by messages sent to the process or by the Erlang BIFs.
          This amount depends on so many things that this field is usually
          uninteresting.</p>
      </item>
      <tag><em>Link list</em></tag>
      <item>
        <p>Process IDs of processes linked to this one. Can also contain
          ports. If process monitoring is used, this field also tells in
          which direction the monitoring is in effect. That is, a link
          "to" a process tells you that the "current" process was
          monitoring the other, and a link "from" a process tells you
         that the other process was monitoring the current one.</p>
      </item>
      <tag><em>Reductions</em></tag>
      <item>
        <p>The number of reductions consumed by the process.</p>
      </item>
      <tag><em>Stack+heap</em></tag>
      <item>
        <p>The size of the stack and heap, in words (they share memory segment).</p>
      </item>
      <tag><em>OldHeap</em></tag>
      <item>
        <p>The size of the "old heap", in words. The Erlang virtual machine uses
          generational garbage collection with two generations. There is
          one heap for new data items and one for the data that has
          survived two garbage collections. The assumption (which is
          almost always correct) is that data surviving two garbage
          collections can be "tenured" to a heap more seldom garbage
          collected, as they will live for a long period. This is a
          usual technique in virtual machines. The sum of the
          heaps and stack together constitute most of the
          allocated memory of the process.</p>
      </item>
      <tag><em>Heap unused, OldHeap unused</em></tag>
      <item>
        <p>The amount of unused memory on each heap, in words. This information is
          usually useless.</p>
      </item>
      <tag><em>Memory</em></tag>
      <item>
        <p>The total memory used by this process, in bytes.
          This includes call stack, heap, and internal structures.
          Same as <seemfa marker="erlang#process_info/2">
          <c>erlang:process_info(Pid,memory)</c></seemfa>.</p>
      </item>
      <tag><em>Program counter</em></tag>
      <item>
        <p>The current instruction pointer. This is only of interest for
          runtime system developers. The function into which the program
          counter points is the current function of the process.</p>
      </item>
      <tag><em>CP</em></tag>
      <item>
        <p>The continuation pointer, that is, the return address for the
          current call. Usually useless for other than runtime system
          developers. This can be followed by the function into which

    <title>Loaded Module Information</title>
    <p>This section contains information about all loaded modules.</p>

    <p>First, the memory use by the loaded code is summarized:</p>

    <taglist>
      <tag><em>Current code</em></tag>
      <item>
        <p>Code that is the current latest version of the modules.</p>

      <item>
        <p>Code where there exists a newer version in the

      </item>
    </taglist>

    <p>Then, all loaded modules are listed. The following fields exist:</p>

      </item>
      <tag><em>Old attributes</em></tag>
      <item>
        <p>Module attributes for the old code, if any. This field is

    <p>This section lists all funs. The following fields exist for each fun:</p>

    <taglist>
      <tag><em>=fun</em></tag>
      <item>
        <p>Heading.</p>
      </item>

      <item>
        <p>The number of references to the fun.</p>
      </item>
    </taglist>
  </section>

  <section>
    <marker id="proc_data"></marker>
    <title>Process Data</title>
    <p>For each process there is at least one <em>=proc_stack</em>
      and one <em>=proc_heap</em> tag, followed by the raw memory
      information for the stack and heap of the process.</p>

    <p>For each process there is also a <em>=proc_messages</em>
      tag if the process message queue is non-empty, and a
      <em>=proc_dictionary</em> tag if the process dictionary (the
      <c><![CDATA[put/2]]></c> and <c><![CDATA[get/1]]></c> thing) is
      non-empty.</p>

    <p>The raw memory information can be decoded by the Crashdump
      Viewer tool. You can then see the stack dump, the
      message queue (if any), and the dictionary (if any).</p>

    <p>The stack dump is a dump of the Erlang process stack. Most of
      the live data (that is, variables currently in use) are placed on
      the stack; thus this can be interesting. One has to
      "guess" what is what, but as the information is symbolic,
      thorough reading of this information can be useful. As an
      example, we can find the state variable of the Erlang primitive
      loader online <c><![CDATA[(5)]]></c> and <c><![CDATA[(6)]]></c>
      in the following example:</p>

    <code type="none"><![CDATA[
(1)  3cac44   Return addr 0x13BF58 (<terminate process normally>)
(2)  y(0)     ["/view/siri_r10_dev/clearcase/otp/erts/lib/kernel/ebin",
(3)            "/view/siri_r10_dev/clearcase/otp/erts/lib/stdlib/ebin"]
(4)  y(1)     <0.1.0>
(5)  y(2)     {state,[],none,#Fun<erl_prim_loader.6.7085890>,undefined,#Fun<erl_prim_loader.7.9000327>,
(6)            #Fun<erl_prim_loader.8.116480692>,#Port<0.2>,infinity,#Fun<erl_prim_loader.9.10708760>}
(7)  y(3)     infinity    ]]></code>

    <p>When interpreting the data for a process, it is helpful to know
      that anonymous function objects (funs) are given the following:</p>

    <list type="bulleted">
      <item>A name constructed from the name of the function in which they are
        created
      </item>
      <item>A number (starting with 0) indicating the number of that fun within
        that function
      </item>
    </list>
  </section>

  <section>
    <marker id="atoms"></marker>
    <title>Atoms</title>
    <p>This section presents all the atoms in the system. This is only
      of interest if one suspects that dynamic generation of atoms can
      be a problem, otherwise this section can be ignored.</p>

    <p>Notice that the last created atom is shown first.</p>
