  <libsummary>API functions for an Erlang NIF library</libsummary>
  <description>
     <warning><p>The NIF concept was introduced in R13B03 as an
	EXPERIMENTAL feature. The interfaces may be changed in any way
	in coming releases. The plan is however to lift the experimental label and
  maintain interface backward compatibility from R14B.</p>
  <p>Incompatible changes in <em>R13B04</em>:</p>
  <list>
    <item>The function prototypes of the NIFs have  changed to expect <c>argc</c> and <c>argv</c>
	  arguments. The arity of a NIF is by that no longer limited to 3.</item>
    <item><c>enif_get_data</c> renamed as <c>enif_priv_data</c>.</item>
    <item><c>enif_make_string</c> got a third argument for character encoding.</item>
  </list>
  </warning>

    <p>A NIF library contains native implementation of some functions
    of an Erlang module. The native implemented functions (NIFs) are
    called like any other functions without any difference to the
    caller. Each NIF must also have an implementation in Erlang that
    will be invoked if the function is called before the NIF library
    has been successfully loaded. A typical such stub implementation
    is to throw an exception. But it can also be used as a fallback
    implementation if the NIF library is not implemented for some
    architecture.</p>     
    <p>A minimal example of a NIF library can look like this:</p>
      <p/>
      <code type="none">
/* niftest.c */
#include "erl_nif.h"

static ERL_NIF_TERM hello(ErlNifEnv* env, int argc, const ERL_NIF_TERM argv[])
{
    return enif_make_string(env, "Hello world!", ERL_NIF_LATIN1);
}

static ErlNifFunc nif_funcs[] =
{
    {"hello", 0, hello}
};

ERL_NIF_INIT(niftest,nif_funcs,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL)
</code>

    <p>and the Erlang module would have to look something like
    this:</p>
      <p/>
      <code type="none">
-module(niftest).

-export([init/0, hello/0]).

init() ->
      erlang:load_nif("./niftest", 0).

hello() ->
      "NIF library not loaded".
</code>
    <p>and compile and test something like this (on Linux):</p>
      <p/>
      <code type="none">
$> gcc -fPIC -shared -o niftest.so niftest.c -I $ERL_ROOT/usr/include/
$> erl

1> c(niftest).
{ok,niftest}
2> niftest:hello().
"NIF library not loaded"
3> niftest:init().
ok
4> niftest:hello().
"Hello world!"
</code>

     <p>A better solution for a real module is to take advantage of
     the new directive <seealso
     marker="doc/reference_manual:code_loading#on_load">on_load</seealso> to automatically
     load the NIF library when the module is loaded.</p>
     <note><p>A NIF must be exported or used locally by the module (or both).
     An unused local stub function will be optimized away by the compiler
      causing loading of the NIF library to fail.</p>
    </note>
     <p>A loaded NIF library is tied to the Erlang module code version
     that loaded it. If the module is upgraded with a new version, the
     new Erlang code will have to load its own NIF library (or maybe choose not
     to). The new code version can however choose to load the exact
     same NIF library as the old code if it wants to. Sharing the same
     dynamic library will mean that static data defined by the library
     will be shared as well. To avoid unintentionally shared static
     data, each Erlang module code can keep its own private data. This
     private data can be set when the NIF library is loaded and
     then retrieved by calling <seealso marker="#enif_priv_data">enif_priv_data()</seealso>.</p>
    <p>There is no way to explicitly unload a NIF library. A library will be
     automatically unloaded when the module code that it belongs to is purged
     by the code server. A NIF library will also be unloaded if it is replaced
     by another version of the library by a second call to
     <c>erlang:load_nif/2</c> from the same module code.</p>

  <title>FUNCTIONALITY</title>
  <p>All functions that a NIF library needs to do with Erlang are
      performed through the NIF API functions. There are functions
      for the following functionality:</p>
    <taglist>
      <tag>Read and write Erlang terms</tag>
      <item><p>Any Erlang terms can be passed to a NIF as function arguments and
      be returned as function return values. The terms are of C-type <c>ERL_NIF_TERM</c>
      and can only be read or written using API functions. Most functions to read
      the content of a term are prefixed <c>enif_get_</c> and usually return
      true (or false) if the term was of the expected type (or not).    
      The functions to write terms are all prefixed <c>enif_make_</c> and usually
      return the created <c>ERL_NIF_TERM</c>. There are also some functions
      to query terms, like <c>enif_is_atom</c>, <c>enif_is_identical</c> and
      <c>enif_compare</c>.</p></item>
      <tag>Binaries</tag>
      <item><p>Terms of type binary are accessed with the help of the struct type
      <seealso marker="#ErlNifBinary">ErlNifBinary</seealso>    
      that contains a pointer (<c>data</c>) to the raw binary data and the length
      (<c>size</c>) of the data in bytes. Both <c>data</c> and <c>size</c> are
      read-only and should only be written using calls to API functions.
      Instances of <c>ErlNifBinary</c> are however always allocated by the user
      (usually as local variables).</p>
      <p>The raw data pointed to by <c>data</c> is only mutable after a call to
      <seealso marker="#enif_alloc_binary">enif_alloc_binary</seealso> or
      <seealso marker="#enif_realloc_binary">enif_realloc_binary</seealso>.
      All other functions that operates on a binary will leave the data as read-only.
      A mutable binary must in the end either be freed with
      <seealso marker="#enif_release_binary">enif_release_binary</seealso>
      or made read-only by transferring it to an Erlang term with
      <seealso marker="#enif_make_binary">enif_make_binary</seealso>.
      But it does not have to happen in the same NIF call. Read-only binaries
      do not have to be released.</p>
      <p><seealso marker="#enif_make_new_binary">enif_make_new_binary</seealso>
      can be used as a shortcut to allocate and return a binary in the same NIF call.</p>
      <p>Binaries are sequences of whole bytes. Bitstrings with an arbitrary
      bit length have no support yet.</p>
       </item>
      <tag>Resource objects</tag>
      <item><p>The use of resource objects is a way to return pointers to
      native data structures from a NIF in a safe way. A resource object is
      just a block of memory allocated with
      <seealso marker="#enif_alloc_resource">enif_alloc_resource()</seealso>.
      A handle ("safe pointer") to this memory block can then be returned to Erlang by the use of
      <seealso marker="#enif_make_resource">enif_make_resource()</seealso>.
      The term returned by <c>enif_make_resource</c>
      is totally opaque in nature. It can be stored and passed between processses
      on the same node, but the only real end usage is to pass it back as argument to a NIF.
      The NIF can then do <seealso marker="#enif_get_resource">enif_get_resource()</seealso>
      and get back a pointer to the memory block that is guaranteed to still be
      valid. A resource object will not be deallocated until the last handle term
      has been garbage collected by the VM and the resource has been
      released with <seealso marker="#enif_release_resource">enif_release_resource()</seealso>
      (not necessarily in that order).</p>      
      <p>All resource objects are created as instances of some <em>resource type</em>.
      This makes resources from different modules to be distinguishable. 
      A resource type is created by calling
      <seealso marker="#enif_open_resource_type">enif_open_resource_type()</seealso>
      when a library is loaded. Objects of that resource type can then later be allocated
      and <c>enif_get_resource</c> verifies that the resource is of the expected type.
      A resource type can have a user supplied destructor function that is
      automatically called when resources of that type are released (by either
      the garbage collector or <c>enif_release_resource</c>). Resource types
      are uniquely identified by a supplied name string.</p>
      <p>Resource types support upgrade in runtime by allowing a loaded NIF
      library to takeover an already existing resource type and thereby
      "inherit" all existing objects of that type. The destructor of the new
      library will thereafter be called for the inherited objects and the
      library with the old destructor function can be safely unloaded. Existing
      resource objects, of a module that is upgraded, must either be deleted
      or taken over by the new NIF library. The unloading of a library will be
      postponed as long as there exist resource objects with a destructor
      function in the library.
      </p>
      <p>Here is a template example of how to create and return a resource object.</p>
      <p/>
      <code type="none">
    ERL_NIF_TERM term;
    MyStruct* ptr = enif_alloc_resource(env, my_resource_type, sizeof(MyStruct));

    /* initialize struct ... */

    term = enif_make_resource(env, ptr);

    if (keep_a_reference_of_our_own) {
        /* store 'ptr' in static variable, private data or other resource object */
    }
    else {
        enif_release_resource(env, obj);
        /* resource now only owned by "Erlang" */
    }
    return term;
}
</code>

      </item>
      <tag>Threads and concurrency</tag>
      <item><p>A NIF is thread-safe without any explicit synchronization as
      long as it acts as a pure function and only reads the supplied
      arguments. As soon as you write towards a shared state either through
      static variables or <seealso marker="#enif_priv_data">enif_priv_data</seealso>
      you need to supply your own explicit synchronization. Resource objects
      will also require synchronization if you treat them as mutable.</p>
      <p>The library initialization callbacks <c>load</c>, <c>reload</c> and
      <c>upgrade</c> are all thread-safe even for shared state data.</p>
      <p>Avoid doing lengthy work in NIF calls as that may degrade the
      responsiveness of the VM. NIFs are called directly by the same scheduler
      thread that executed the calling Erlang code. The calling scheduler will thus
      be blocked from doing any other work until the NIF returns.</p>

        <p>Variables of type <c>ERL_NIF_TERM</c> can refer to any Erlang term.
        This is an opaque type and values of it can only by used either as
        arguments to API functions or as return values from NIFs. A variable of
        type <c>ERL_NIF_TERM</c> is only valid until the NIF call, where it was

          functions. An <c>ErlNifEnv</c> pointer is only valid until
          the function, where it was supplied as argument,
