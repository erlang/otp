  <libsummary>API functions for an Erlang NIF library</libsummary>
  <description>
    <p>A NIF library contains native implementation of some functions
    of an Erlang module. The native implemented functions (NIFs) are
    called like any other functions without any difference to the
    caller. Each NIF must also have an implementation in Erlang that
    will be invoked if the function is called before the NIF library
    has been successfully loaded. A typical such stub implementation
    is to throw an exception. But it can also be used as a fallback
    implementation if the NIF library is not implemented for some
    architecture.</p>     
    <marker id="WARNING"/>
      <warning><p><em>Use this functionality with extreme care!</em></p>
      <p>A native function is executed as a direct extension of the
      native code of the VM. Execution is not made in a safe environment.
      The VM can <em>not</em> provide the same services as provided when
      executing Erlang code, such as preemptive scheduling or memory
      protection. If the native function doesn't behave well, the whole
      VM will misbehave.</p>
      <list>
	<item><p>A native function that crash will crash the whole VM.</p></item>
	<item><p>An erroneously implemented native function might cause
	a VM internal state inconsistency which may cause a crash of the VM,
	or miscellaneous misbehaviors of the VM at any point after the call
	to the native function.</p></item>
	<item><p>A native function that do <seealso marker="#lengthy_work">lengthy
	work</seealso> before returning will degrade responsiveness of the VM,
	and may cause miscellaneous strange behaviors. Such strange behaviors
	include, but are not limited to, extreme memory usage, and bad load
	balancing between schedulers. Strange behaviors that might occur due
	to lengthy work may also vary between OTP releases.</p></item>
      </list>
      </warning>

    <p>A minimal example of a NIF library can look like this:</p>
      <p/>
      <code type="none">
/* niftest.c */
#include "erl_nif.h"

static ERL_NIF_TERM hello(ErlNifEnv* env, int argc, const ERL_NIF_TERM argv[])
{
    return enif_make_string(env, "Hello world!", ERL_NIF_LATIN1);
}

static ErlNifFunc nif_funcs[] =
{
    {"hello", 0, hello}
};

ERL_NIF_INIT(niftest,nif_funcs,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL)
</code>

    <p>and the Erlang module would have to look something like
    this:</p>
      <p/>
      <code type="none">
-module(niftest).

-export([init/0, hello/0]).

init() ->
      erlang:load_nif("./niftest", 0).

hello() ->
      "NIF library not loaded".
</code>
    <p>and compile and test something like this (on Linux):</p>
      <p/>
      <code type="none">
$> gcc -fPIC -shared -o niftest.so niftest.c -I $ERL_ROOT/usr/include/
$> erl

1> c(niftest).
{ok,niftest}
2> niftest:hello().
"NIF library not loaded"
3> niftest:init().
ok
4> niftest:hello().
"Hello world!"
</code>

     <p>A better solution for a real module is to take advantage of
     the new directive <seealso
     marker="doc/reference_manual:code_loading#on_load">on_load</seealso> to automatically
     load the NIF library when the module is loaded.</p>
     <note><p>A NIF does not have to be exported, it can be local to the module.
     Note however that unused local stub functions will be optimized
     away by the compiler causing loading of the NIF library to fail.</p>
    </note>
     <p>A loaded NIF library is tied to the Erlang module code version
     that loaded it. If the module is upgraded with a new version, the
     new Erlang code will have to load its own NIF library (or maybe choose not
     to). The new code version can however choose to load the exact
     same NIF library as the old code if it wants to. Sharing the same
     dynamic library will mean that static data defined by the library
     will be shared as well. To avoid unintentionally shared static
     data, each Erlang module code can keep its own private data. This
     private data can be set when the NIF library is loaded and
     then retrieved by calling <seealso marker="#enif_priv_data">enif_priv_data</seealso>.</p>
    <p>There is no way to explicitly unload a NIF library. A library will be
     automatically unloaded when the module code that it belongs to is purged
     by the code server.</p>

     <p><marker id="lengthy_work"/>
     As mentioned in the <seealso marker="#WARNING">warning</seealso> text at
     the beginning of this document it is of vital importance that a native function
     return relatively quickly. It is hard to give an exact maximum amount
     of time that a native function is allowed to work, but as a rule of thumb
     a well-behaving native function should return to its caller before a
     millisecond has passed. This can be achieved using different approaches.
     If you have full control over the code to execute in the native
     function, the best approach is to divide the work into multiple chunks of
     work and call the native function multiple times, either directly from Erlang code
     or by having a native function schedule a future NIF call via the
     <seealso marker="#enif_schedule_nif"> enif_schedule_nif</seealso> function. Function
     <seealso marker="#enif_consume_timeslice">enif_consume_timeslice</seealso> can be
     used to help with such work division. In some cases, however, this might not
     be possible, e.g. when calling third-party libraries. Then you typically want
     to dispatch the work to another thread, return
     from the native function, and wait for the result. The thread can send
     the result back to the calling thread using message passing. Information
     about thread primitives can be found below. If you have built your system
     with <em>the currently experimental</em> support for dirty schedulers,
     you may want to try out this functionality by dispatching the work to a
     <seealso marker="#dirty_nifs">dirty NIF</seealso>,
     which does not have the same duration restriction as a normal NIF.</p>

  <title>FUNCTIONALITY</title>
  <p>All functions that a NIF library needs to do with Erlang are
      performed through the NIF API functions. There are functions
      for the following functionality:</p>
    <taglist>
      <tag>Read and write Erlang terms</tag>
      <item><p>Any Erlang terms can be passed to a NIF as function arguments and
      be returned as function return values. The terms are of C-type
      <seealso marker="#ERL_NIF_TERM">ERL_NIF_TERM</seealso>
      and can only be read or written using API functions. Most functions to read
      the content of a term are prefixed <c>enif_get_</c> and usually return
      true (or false) if the term was of the expected type (or not).    
      The functions to write terms are all prefixed <c>enif_make_</c> and usually
      return the created <c>ERL_NIF_TERM</c>. There are also some functions
      to query terms, like <c>enif_is_atom</c>, <c>enif_is_identical</c> and
      <c>enif_compare</c>.</p>
      <p>All terms of type <c>ERL_NIF_TERM</c> belong to an environment of type
      <seealso marker="#ErlNifEnv">ErlNifEnv</seealso>. The lifetime of a term is
      controlled by the lifetime of its environment object. All API functions that read
      or write terms has the environment, that the term belongs to, as the first
      function argument.</p></item>
      <tag>Binaries</tag>
      <item><p>Terms of type binary are accessed with the help of the struct type
      <seealso marker="#ErlNifBinary">ErlNifBinary</seealso>    
      that contains a pointer (<c>data</c>) to the raw binary data and the length
      (<c>size</c>) of the data in bytes. Both <c>data</c> and <c>size</c> are
      read-only and should only be written using calls to API functions.
      Instances of <c>ErlNifBinary</c> are however always allocated by the user
      (usually as local variables).</p>
      <p>The raw data pointed to by <c>data</c> is only mutable after a call to
      <seealso marker="#enif_alloc_binary">enif_alloc_binary</seealso> or
      <seealso marker="#enif_realloc_binary">enif_realloc_binary</seealso>.
      All other functions that operates on a binary will leave the data as read-only.
      A mutable binary must in the end either be freed with
      <seealso marker="#enif_release_binary">enif_release_binary</seealso>
      or made read-only by transferring it to an Erlang term with
      <seealso marker="#enif_make_binary">enif_make_binary</seealso>.
      But it does not have to happen in the same NIF call. Read-only binaries
      do not have to be released.</p>
      <p><seealso marker="#enif_make_new_binary">enif_make_new_binary</seealso>
      can be used as a shortcut to allocate and return a binary in the same NIF call.</p>
      <p>Binaries are sequences of whole bytes. Bitstrings with an arbitrary
      bit length have no support yet.</p>
       </item>
      <tag>Resource objects</tag>
      <item><p>The use of resource objects is a safe way to return pointers to
      native data structures from a NIF. A resource object is
      just a block of memory allocated with
      <seealso marker="#enif_alloc_resource">enif_alloc_resource</seealso>.
      A handle ("safe pointer") to this memory block can then be returned to Erlang by the use of
      <seealso marker="#enif_make_resource">enif_make_resource</seealso>.
      The term returned by <c>enif_make_resource</c>
      is totally opaque in nature. It can be stored and passed between processes
      on the same node, but the only real end usage is to pass it back as an argument to a NIF.
      The NIF can then call <seealso marker="#enif_get_resource">enif_get_resource</seealso>
      and get back a pointer to the memory block that is guaranteed to still be
      valid. A resource object will not be deallocated until the last handle term
      has been garbage collected by the VM and the resource has been
      released with <seealso marker="#enif_release_resource">enif_release_resource</seealso>
      (not necessarily in that order).</p>      
      <p>All resource objects are created as instances of some <em>resource type</em>.
      This makes resources from different modules to be distinguishable. 
      A resource type is created by calling
      <seealso marker="#enif_open_resource_type">enif_open_resource_type</seealso>
      when a library is loaded. Objects of that resource type can then later be allocated
      and <c>enif_get_resource</c> verifies that the resource is of the expected type.
      A resource type can have a user supplied destructor function that is
      automatically called when resources of that type are released (by either
      the garbage collector or <c>enif_release_resource</c>). Resource types
      are uniquely identified by a supplied name string and the name of the
      implementing module.</p>
      <marker id="enif_resource_example"/><p>Here is a template example of how to create and return a resource object.</p>
      <p/>
      <code type="none">
    ERL_NIF_TERM term;
    MyStruct* obj = enif_alloc_resource(my_resource_type, sizeof(MyStruct));

    /* initialize struct ... */

    term = enif_make_resource(env, obj);

    if (keep_a_reference_of_our_own) {
        /* store 'obj' in static variable, private data or other resource object */
    }
    else {
        enif_release_resource(obj);
        /* resource now only owned by "Erlang" */
    }
    return term;
    </code>
      <p>Note that once <c>enif_make_resource</c> creates the term to
      return to Erlang, the code can choose to either keep its own
      native pointer to the allocated struct and release it later, or
      release it immediately and rely solely on the garbage collector
      to eventually deallocate the resource object when it collects
      the term.</p> 
      <p>Another usage of resource objects is to create binary terms with
      user defined memory management.
      <seealso marker="#enif_make_resource_binary">enif_make_resource_binary</seealso>
      will create a binary term that is connected to a resource object. The
      destructor of the resource will be called when the binary is garbage
      collected, at which time the binary data can be released. An example of
      this can be a binary term consisting of data from a <c>mmap</c>'ed file.
      The destructor can then do <c>munmap</c> to release the memory
      region.</p>
      <p>Resource types support upgrade in runtime by allowing a loaded NIF
      library to takeover an already existing resource type and thereby
      "inherit" all existing objects of that type. The destructor of the new
      library will thereafter be called for the inherited objects and the
      library with the old destructor function can be safely unloaded. Existing
      resource objects, of a module that is upgraded, must either be deleted
      or taken over by the new NIF library. The unloading of a library will be
      postponed as long as there exist resource objects with a destructor
      function in the library.
      </p>
      </item>
      <tag>Threads and concurrency</tag>
      <item><p>A NIF is thread-safe without any explicit synchronization as
      long as it acts as a pure function and only reads the supplied
      arguments. As soon as you write towards a shared state either through
      static variables or <seealso marker="#enif_priv_data">enif_priv_data</seealso>
      you need to supply your own explicit synchronization. This includes terms
      in process independent environments that are shared between threads.
      Resource objects will also require synchronization if you treat them as
      mutable.</p>
      <p>The library initialization callbacks <c>load</c>, <c>reload</c> and
      <c>upgrade</c> are all thread-safe even for shared state data.</p>
      </item>

      <tag><marker id="version_management"/>Version Management</tag>
      <item><p>
      When a NIF library is built, information about NIF API version
      is compiled into the library. When a NIF library is loaded the
      runtime system verifies that the library is of a compatible version.
      <c>erl_nif.h</c> defines <c>ERL_NIF_MAJOR_VERSION</c>, and
      <c>ERL_NIF_MINOR_VERSION</c>. <c>ERL_NIF_MAJOR_VERSION</c> will be
      incremented when NIF library incompatible changes are made to the
      Erlang runtime system. Normally it will suffice to recompile the NIF
      library when the <c>ERL_NIF_MAJOR_VERSION</c> has changed, but it
      could, under rare circumstances, mean that NIF libraries have to
      be slightly modified. If so, this will of course be documented.
      <c>ERL_NIF_MINOR_VERSION</c> will be incremented when
      new features are added. The runtime system uses the minor version
      to determine what features to use.
      </p><p>
      The runtime system will normally refuse to load a NIF library if
      the major versions differ, or if the major versions are equal and
      the minor version used by the NIF library is greater than the one
      used by the runtime system. Old NIF libraries with lower major
      versions will however be allowed after a bump of the major version
      during a transition period of two major releases. Such old NIF
      libraries might however fail if deprecated features are used.
      </p></item>

      <tag>Long-running NIFs</tag>
      <item><p><marker id="dirty_nifs"/>Native functions
      <seealso marker="#lengthy_work">
      must normally run quickly</seealso>, as explained earlier in this document. They
      generally should execute for no more than a millisecond. But not all native functions
      can execute so quickly; for example, functions that encrypt large blocks of data or
      perform lengthy file system operations can often run for tens of seconds or more.</p>
      <p>If the functionality of a long-running NIF can be split so that its work can be
      achieved through a series of shorter NIF calls, the application can either make that series
      of NIF calls from the Erlang level, or it can call a NIF that first performs a chunk of the
      work, then invokes the <seealso marker="#enif_schedule_nif">enif_schedule_nif</seealso>
      function to schedule another NIF call to perform the next chunk. The final call scheduled
      in this manner can then return the overall result. Breaking up a long-running function in
      this manner enables the VM to regain control between calls to the NIFs, thereby avoiding
      degraded responsiveness, scheduler load balancing problems, and other strange behaviours.</p>
      <p>A NIF that cannot be split and cannot execute in a millisecond or less is called a "dirty NIF"
      because it performs work that the Erlang runtime cannot handle cleanly.
      <em>Note that the dirty NIF functionality described here is experimental</em> and that you have to
      enable support for dirty schedulers when building OTP in order to try the functionality out.
      Applications that make use of such functions must indicate to the runtime that the functions are
      dirty so they can be handled specially. To schedule a dirty NIF for execution, the
      appropriate flags value can be set for the NIF in its <seealso marker="#ErlNifFunc">ErlNifFunc</seealso>
      entry, or the application can call <seealso marker="#enif_schedule_nif">enif_schedule_nif</seealso>,
      passing to it a pointer to the dirty NIF to be executed and indicating with the <c>flags</c>
      argument whether it expects the operation to be CPU-bound or I/O-bound.</p>
      <note><p>Dirty NIF support is available only when the emulator is configured with dirty
      schedulers enabled. This feature is currently disabled by default. To determine whether
      the dirty NIF API is available, native code can check to see if the C preprocessor macro
      <c>ERL_NIF_DIRTY_SCHEDULER_SUPPORT</c> is defined. Also, if the Erlang runtime was built
      without threading support, dirty schedulers are disabled. To check at runtime for the presence
      of dirty scheduler threads, code can use the <seealso marker="#enif_system_info"><c>
      enif_system_info()</c></seealso> API function.</p></note>

        <p>Variables of type <c>ERL_NIF_TERM</c> can refer to any Erlang term.
        This is an opaque type and values of it can only by used either as
        arguments to API functions or as return values from NIFs. All
        <c>ERL_NIF_TERM</c>'s belong to an environment
        (<seealso marker="#ErlNifEnv">ErlNifEnv</seealso>). A term can not be
        destructed individually, it is valid until its environment is destructed.</p>

        <p><c>ErlNifEnv</c> represents an environment that can host Erlang terms.
        All terms in an environment are valid as long as the environment is valid.
        <c>ErlNifEnv</c> is an opaque type and pointers to it can only be passed
        on to API functions. There are two types of environments; process
        bound and process independent.</p>
        <p>A <em>process bound environment</em> is passed as the first argument to all NIFs.
        All function arguments passed to a NIF will belong to that environment.
        The return value from a NIF must also be a term belonging to the same
        environment.
        In addition a process bound environment contains transient information
        about the calling Erlang process. The environment is only valid in the 
        thread where it was supplied as argument until the NIF returns. It is
        thus useless and dangerous to store pointers to process bound
        environments between NIF calls. </p>
        <p>A <em>process independent environment</em> is created by calling
        <seealso marker="#enif_alloc_env">enif_alloc_env</seealso>. It can be
        used to store terms between NIF calls and to send terms with
        <seealso marker="#enif_send">enif_send</seealso>. A process
        independent environment with all its terms is valid until you explicitly
        invalidates it with <seealso marker="#enif_free_env">enif_free_env</seealso>
        or <c>enif_send</c>.</p>
        <p>All contained terms of a list/tuple/map must belong to the same
	environment as the list/tuple/map itself. Terms can be copied between
	environments with

      <fsummary>Schedule a NIF for execution</fsummary>
      <desc>
          <p>Schedule NIF <c>fp</c> to execute. This function allows an application to break up long-running
          work into multiple regular NIF calls or to schedule a <seealso marker="#dirty_nifs">dirty NIF</seealso>
          to execute on a dirty scheduler thread (<em>note that the dirty NIF functionality described here is
          experimental</em> and that you have to enable support for dirty schedulers when building OTP in
          order to try the functionality out).</p>
          <p>The <c>fun_name</c> argument provides a name for the NIF being scheduled for execution. If it cannot
          be converted to an atom, <c>enif_schedule_nif</c> returns a <c>badarg</c> exception.</p>
          <p>The <c>flags</c> argument must be set to 0 for a regular NIF, or if the emulator was built the
          experimental dirty scheduler support enabled, <c>flags</c> can be set to either <c>ERL_NIF_DIRTY_JOB_CPU_BOUND</c>
          if the job is expected to be primarily CPU-bound, or <c>ERL_NIF_DIRTY_JOB_IO_BOUND</c> for jobs that will
          be I/O-bound. If dirty scheduler threads are not available in the emulator, a try to schedule such a job
          will result in a <c>badarg</c> exception.</p>

          <p>The <c>argc</c> and <c>argv</c> arguments can either be the originals passed into the calling NIF, or
          they can be values created by the calling NIF.</p>
          <p>The calling NIF must use the return value of <c>enif_schedule_nif</c> as its own return value.</p>
          <p>Be aware that <c>enif_schedule_nif</c>, as its name implies, only schedules the
          NIF for future execution. The calling NIF does not block waiting for the scheduled NIF to
          execute and return, which means that the calling NIF can't expect to receive the scheduled NIF
          return value and use it for further operations.</p>
