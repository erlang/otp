  <libsummary>API functions for an Erlang NIF library.</libsummary>
  <description>
    <p>A NIF library contains native implementation of some functions
      of an Erlang module. The native implemented functions (NIFs) are
      called like any other functions without any difference to the
      caller. Each NIF must have an implementation in Erlang that
      is invoked if the function is called before the NIF library
      is successfully loaded. A typical such stub implementation
      is to throw an exception. But it can also be used as a fallback
      implementation if the NIF library is not implemented for some
      architecture.</p>

    <warning>
      <marker id="WARNING"/>
      <p><em>Use this functionality with extreme care.</em></p>
      <p>A native function is executed as a direct extension of the
        native code of the VM. Execution is not made in a safe environment.
        The VM <em>cannot</em> provide the same services as provided when
        executing Erlang code, such as pre-emptive scheduling or memory
        protection. If the native function does not behave well, the whole
        VM will misbehave.</p>
      <list type="bulleted">
        <item>
          <p>A native function that crash will crash the whole VM.</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>An erroneously implemented native function can cause a VM
            internal state inconsistency, which can cause a crash of the VM,
            or miscellaneous misbehaviors of the VM at any point after the
            call to the native function.</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>A native function doing <seealso marker="#lengthy_work">lengthy
            work</seealso> before returning degrades responsiveness of the VM,
            and can cause miscellaneous strange behaviors. Such strange
            behaviors include, but are not limited to, extreme memory usage,
            and bad load balancing between schedulers. Strange behaviors that
            can occur because of lengthy work can also vary between Erlang/OTP
            releases.</p>
        </item>
      </list>
    </warning>

    <p>A minimal example of a NIF library can look as follows:</p>

    <code type="none">
/* niftest.c */
#include "erl_nif.h"

static ERL_NIF_TERM hello(ErlNifEnv* env, int argc, const ERL_NIF_TERM argv[])
{
    return enif_make_string(env, "Hello world!", ERL_NIF_LATIN1);
}

static ErlNifFunc nif_funcs[] =
{
    {"hello", 0, hello}
};

ERL_NIF_INIT(niftest,nif_funcs,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL)</code>

    <p>The Erlang module can look as follows:</p>

    <code type="none">
-module(niftest).

-export([init/0, hello/0]).

init() ->
      erlang:load_nif("./niftest", 0).

hello() ->
      "NIF library not loaded".</code>

    <p>Compile and test can look as follows (on Linux):</p>

    <code type="none">
$> gcc -fPIC -shared -o niftest.so niftest.c -I $ERL_ROOT/usr/include/
$> erl

1> c(niftest).
{ok,niftest}
2> niftest:hello().
"NIF library not loaded"
3> niftest:init().
ok
4> niftest:hello().
"Hello world!"</code>

    <p>A better solution for a real module is to take advantage of the new
      directive <c>on load</c> (see section
      <seealso marker="doc/reference_manual:code_loading#on_load">Running a
      Function When a Module is Loaded</seealso> in the Erlang Reference
      Manual) to load the NIF library automatically when the module is
      loaded.</p>

    <note>
      <p>A NIF does not have to be exported, it can be local to the module.
        However, unused local stub functions will be optimized
        away by the compiler, causing loading of the NIF library to fail.</p>
    </note>

    <p>A loaded NIF library is tied to the Erlang module code version
      that loaded it. If the module is upgraded with a new version, the
      new Erlang code need to load its own NIF library (or maybe choose not
      to). The new code version can, however, choose to load the
      same NIF library as the old code if it wants to. Sharing the
      dynamic library means that static data defined by the library
      is shared as well. To avoid unintentionally shared static
      data, each Erlang module code can keep its own private data. This
      private data can be set when the NIF library is loaded and
      then retrieved by calling <seealso marker="#enif_priv_data">
      <c>enif_priv_data</c></seealso>.</p>

    <p>A NIF library cannot be loaded explicitly. A library is
      automatically unloaded when the module code that it belongs to is purged
      by the code server.</p>

  <title>Functionality</title>
    <p>All functions that a NIF library needs to do with Erlang are
      performed through the NIF API functions. Functions exist
      for the following functionality:</p>

    <taglist>
      <tag>Read and write Erlang terms</tag>
      <item>
        <p>Any Erlang terms can be passed to a NIF as function arguments and
          be returned as function return values. The terms are of C-type
          <seealso marker="#ERL_NIF_TERM"><c>ERL_NIF_TERM</c></seealso> and can
          only be read or written using API functions. Most functions to read
          the content of a term are prefixed <c>enif_get_</c> and usually return
          <c>true</c> (or <c>false</c>) if the term is of the expected type (or
          not). The functions to write terms are all prefixed <c>enif_make_</c>
          and usually
          return the created <c>ERL_NIF_TERM</c>. There are also some functions
          to query terms, like <c>enif_is_atom</c>, <c>enif_is_identical</c>,
          and <c>enif_compare</c>.</p>
        <p>All terms of type <c>ERL_NIF_TERM</c> belong to an environment of
          type <seealso marker="#ErlNifEnv"><c>ErlNifEnv</c></seealso>. The
          lifetime of a term is controlled by the lifetime of its environment
          object. All API functions that read or write terms has the
          environment that the term belongs to as the first function
          argument.</p>
      </item>
      <tag>Binaries</tag>
      <item>
        <p>Terms of type binary are accessed with the help of struct type
          <seealso marker="#ErlNifBinary"><c>ErlNifBinary</c></seealso>,
          which contains a pointer (<c>data</c>) to the raw binary data and the
          length (<c>size</c>) of the data in bytes. Both <c>data</c> and
          <c>size</c> are read-only and are only to be written using calls to
          API functions. Instances of <c>ErlNifBinary</c> are, however, always
          allocated by the user (usually as local variables).</p>
        <p>The raw data pointed to by <c>data</c> is only mutable after a call
          to <seealso marker="#enif_alloc_binary">
          <c>enif_alloc_binary</c></seealso> or
          <seealso marker="#enif_realloc_binary">
          <c>enif_realloc_binary</c></seealso>. All other functions that
          operate on a binary leave the data as read-only.
          A mutable binary must in the end either be freed with
          <seealso marker="#enif_release_binary">
          <c>enif_release_binary</c></seealso>
          or made read-only by transferring it to an Erlang term with
          <seealso marker="#enif_make_binary"><c>enif_make_binary</c></seealso>.
          However, it does not have to occur in the same NIF call. Read-only
          binaries do not have to be released.</p>
        <p><seealso marker="#enif_make_new_binary">
          <c>enif_make_new_binary</c></seealso> can be used as a shortcut to
          allocate and return a binary in the same NIF call.</p>
        <p>Binaries are sequences of whole bytes. Bitstrings with an arbitrary
          bit length have no support yet.</p>
      </item>
      <tag>Resource objects</tag>
      <item>
        <p>The use of resource objects is a safe way to return pointers to
          native data structures from a NIF. A resource object is
          only a block of memory allocated with
          <seealso marker="#enif_alloc_resource">
          <c>enif_alloc_resource</c></seealso>.
          A handle ("safe pointer") to this memory block can then be returned
          to Erlang by the use of
          <seealso marker="#enif_make_resource">
          <c>enif_make_resource</c></seealso>.
          The term returned by <c>enif_make_resource</c> is opaque in nature.
          It can be stored and passed between processes on the same node, but
          the only real end usage is to pass it back as an argument to a NIF.
          The NIF can then call <seealso marker="#enif_get_resource">
          <c>enif_get_resource</c></seealso> and get back a pointer to the
          memory block, which is guaranteed to still be valid. A resource
          object is not deallocated until the last handle term
          is garbage collected by the VM and the resource is released with
          <seealso marker="#enif_release_resource">
          <c>enif_release_resource</c></seealso>
          (not necessarily in that order).</p>
        <p>All resource objects are created as instances of some <em>resource
          type</em>. This makes resources from different modules to be
          distinguishable. A resource type is created by calling
          <seealso marker="#enif_open_resource_type">
          <c>enif_open_resource_type</c></seealso> when a library is loaded.
          Objects of that resource type can then later be allocated and
          <c>enif_get_resource</c> verifies that the resource is of the
          expected type. A resource type can have a user-supplied destructor
          function, which is automatically called when resources of that type
          are released (by either the garbage collector or
          <c>enif_release_resource</c>). Resource types are uniquely identified
          by a supplied name string and the name of the implementing module.</p>
        <marker id="enif_resource_example"/>
        <p>The following is a template example of how to create and return a
          resource object.</p>
        <code type="none">
ERL_NIF_TERM term;
MyStruct* obj = enif_alloc_resource(my_resource_type, sizeof(MyStruct));

/* initialize struct ... */

term = enif_make_resource(env, obj);

if (keep_a_reference_of_our_own) {
    /* store 'obj' in static variable, private data or other resource object */
}
else {
    enif_release_resource(obj);
    /* resource now only owned by "Erlang" */
}
return term;</code>
        <p>Notice that once <c>enif_make_resource</c> creates the term to
          return to Erlang, the code can choose to either keep its own
          native pointer to the allocated struct and release it later, or
          release it immediately and rely only on the garbage collector
          to deallocate the resource object eventually when it collects
          the term.</p> 
        <p>Another use of resource objects is to create binary terms with
          user-defined memory management.
          <seealso marker="#enif_make_resource_binary">
          <c>enif_make_resource_binary</c></seealso>
          creates a binary term that is connected to a resource object. The
          destructor of the resource is called when the binary is garbage
          collected, at which time the binary data can be released. An example
          of this can be a binary term consisting of data from a <c>mmap</c>'ed
          file. The destructor can then do <c>munmap</c> to release the memory
          region.</p>
        <p>Resource types support upgrade in runtime by allowing a loaded NIF
          library to take over an already existing resource type and by that
          "inherit" all existing objects of that type. The destructor of the
          new library is thereafter called for the inherited objects and the
          library with the old destructor function can be safely unloaded.
          Existing resource objects, of a module that is upgraded, must either
          be deleted or taken over by the new NIF library. The unloading of a
          library is postponed as long as there exist resource objects with a
          destructor function in the library.</p>
      </item>
      <tag>Threads and concurrency</tag>
      <item>
        <p>A NIF is thread-safe without any explicit synchronization as
          long as it acts as a pure function and only reads the supplied
          arguments. When you write to a shared state either through
          static variables or <seealso marker="#enif_priv_data">
          <c>enif_priv_data</c></seealso>, you need to supply your own explicit
          synchronization. This includes terms in process-independent
          environments that are shared between threads. Resource objects also
          require synchronization if you treat them as mutable.</p>
        <p>The library initialization callbacks <c>load</c>, <c>reload</c>, and
          <c>upgrade</c> are all thread-safe even for shared state data.</p>
      </item>
      <tag><marker id="version_management"/>Version Management</tag>
      <item>
        <p>When a NIF library is built, information about the NIF API version
          is compiled into the library. When a NIF library is loaded, the
          runtime system verifies that the library is of a compatible version.
          <c>erl_nif.h</c> defines the following:</p>
        <taglist>
          <tag><c>ERL_NIF_MAJOR_VERSION</c></tag>
          <item>
            <p>Incremented when NIF library incompatible changes are made to the
              Erlang runtime system. Normally it suffices to recompile the NIF
              library when the <c>ERL_NIF_MAJOR_VERSION</c> has changed, but it
              can, under rare circumstances, mean that NIF libraries must be
              slightly modified. If so, this will of course be documented.</p>
          </item>
          <tag><c>ERL_NIF_MINOR_VERSION</c></tag>
          <item>
            <p>Incremented when new features are added. The runtime system uses
              the minor version to determine what features to use.</p>
          </item>
        </taglist>
        <p>The runtime system normally refuses to load a NIF library if
          the major versions differ, or if the major versions are equal and
          the minor version used by the NIF library is greater than the one
          used by the runtime system. Old NIF libraries with lower major
          versions are, however, allowed after a bump of the major version
          during a transition period of two major releases. Such old NIF
          libraries can however fail if deprecated features are used.</p>

        <p>As mentioned in the <seealso marker="#WARNING">warning</seealso> text
          at the beginning of this manual page, it is of <em>vital
          importance</em> that a native function returns relatively fast. It is
          difficult to give an exact maximum amount of time that a native
          function is allowed to work, but usually a well-behaving native
          function is to return to its caller within 1 millisecond. This can be
          achieved using different approaches. If you have full control over the
          code to execute in the native function, the best approach is to
          divide the work into multiple chunks of work and call the native
          function multiple times. This is, however, not always possible, for
          example when calling third-party libraries.</p>
        <p>The <seealso marker="#enif_consume_timeslice">
          <c>enif_consume_timeslice()</c></seealso> function can be used to
          inform the runtime system about the length of the NIF call.
          It is typically always to be used unless the NIF executes very
          fast.</p>
        <p>If the NIF call is too lengthy, this must be handled in one of
          the following ways to avoid degraded responsiveness, scheduler load
          balancing problems, and other strange behaviors:</p>
        <taglist>
          <tag>Yielding NIF</tag>
          <item>
            <p>If the functionality of a long-running NIF can be split so that
              its work can be achieved through a series of shorter NIF calls,
              the application has two options:</p>
            <list type="bulleted">
              <item>
                <p>Make that series of NIF calls from the Erlang level.</p>
              </item>
              <item>
                <p>Call a NIF that first performs a chunk of the work, then
                  invokes the <seealso marker="#enif_schedule_nif">
                  <c>enif_schedule_nif</c></seealso> function to schedule
                  another NIF call to perform the next chunk. The final call
                  scheduled in this manner can then return the overall
                  result.</p>
              </item>
            </list>
            <p>Breaking up a long-running function in this manner enables the
              VM to regain control between calls to the NIFs.</p>
            <p>This approach is always preferred over the other alternatives
              described below. This both from a performance perspective and
              a system characteristics perspective.</p>

            <note>
              <p><em>The dirty NIF functionality described here
                is experimental</em>. Dirty NIF support is available only when
                the emulator is configured with dirty schedulers enabled. This
                feature is disabled by default. The Erlang runtime
                without SMP support does not support dirty schedulers even when
                the dirty scheduler support is enabled. To check at runtime for
                the presence of dirty scheduler threads, code can use the
                <seealso marker="#enif_system_info">
                <c>enif_system_info()</c></seealso> API function.</p>
            </note>
            <p>A NIF that cannot be split and cannot execute in a millisecond
              or less is called a "dirty NIF", as it performs work that the
              ordinary schedulers of the Erlang runtime system cannot handle cleanly.
              Applications that make use of such functions must indicate to the
              runtime that the functions are dirty so they can be handled 
              specially. This is handled by executing dirty jobs on a separate
	      set of schedulers called dirty schedulers. A dirty NIF executing
	      on a dirty scheduler does not have the same duration restriction
	      as a normal NIF.
            </p>

            <p>
              It is important to classify the dirty job correct. An I/O bound
	      job should be classified as such, and a CPU bound job should be
	      classified as such. If you should classify CPU bound jobs
	      as I/O bound jobs, dirty I/O schedulers might starve ordinary
	      schedulers. I/O bound jobs are expected to either block waiting
	      for I/O, and/or spend a limited amount of time moving data.
            </p>

            <p>
              To schedule a dirty NIF for execution, the application has two options:</p>

                  <c>flags</c> whether it expects the operation to be CPU-bound
                  or I/O-bound.</p>

            </list>
            <p>A job that alternates between I/O bound and CPU bound can be
              reclassified and rescheduled using <c>enif_schedule_nif</c> so
              that it executes on the correct type of dirty scheduler at all
              times. For more information see the documentation of the
              <c>erl(1)</c> command line arguments

            <p>While a process executes a dirty NIF, some operations that
              communicate with it can take a very long time to complete.
              Suspend or garbage collection of a process executing a dirty
              NIF cannot be done until the dirty NIF has returned. Thus, other
              processes waiting for such operations to complete might
              have to wait for a very long time. Blocking multi-scheduling, that
              is, calling <seealso marker="erlang#system_flag_multi_scheduling">
              <c>erlang:system_flag(multi_scheduling, block)</c></seealso>, can
              also take a very long time to complete. This becaue all ongoing
              dirty operations on all dirty schedulers must complete before
              the block operation can complete.</p>
            <p>Many operations communicating with a process executing a
              dirty NIF can, however, complete while it executes the
              dirty NIF. For example, retrieving information about it through
              <seealso marker="erlang:process_info/1">
              <c>erlang:process_info</c></seealso>, setting its group leader,
              register/unregister its name, and so on.</p>
            <p>Termination of a process executing a dirty NIF can only be
              completed up to a certain point while it executes the dirty NIF.
              All Erlang resources, such as its registered name and its <c>ets</c>
              tables, are released. All links and monitors are triggered. The
              execution of the NIF is, however, <em>not</em> stopped. The NIF
              can safely continue execution, allocate heap memory, and so on,
              but it is of course better to stop executing as soon as possible.
              The NIF can check whether a current process is alive using
              <seealso marker="#enif_is_current_process_alive">
              <c>enif_is_current_process_alive</c></seealso>. Communication

              <seealso marker="#enif_port_command">
              <c>enif_port_command</c></seealso> is also dropped when the
              sending process is not alive. Deallocation of certain internal
              resources, such as process heap and process control block, is
              delayed until the dirty NIF has completed.</p>

                <p>As purging of a module might need to garbage
                  collect a process to determine if it has
                  references to the module, a process executing a dirty

        <p>Variables of type <c>ERL_NIF_TERM</c> can refer to any Erlang term.
          This is an opaque type and values of it can only by used either as

        <p><c>ErlNifEnv</c> represents an environment that can host Erlang
          terms. All terms in an environment are valid as long as the

      <desc>
        <p>Gives the runtime system a hint about how much CPU time the current
          NIF call has consumed since the last hint, or since the start of the
          NIF if no previous hint has been specified. The time is specified as a
          percent of the timeslice that a process is allowed to execute
          Erlang code until it can be suspended to give time for other runnable
          processes. The scheduling timeslice is not an exact entity, but can
          usually be approximated to about 1 millisecond.</p>
        <p>Notice that it is up to the runtime system to determine if and how
          to use this information. Implementations on some platforms can use
          other means to determine consumed CPU time. Lengthy NIFs should
          regardless of this frequently call <c>enif_consume_timeslice</c> to
          determine if it is allowed to continue execution.</p>
        <p>Argument <c>percent</c> must be an integer between 1 and 100. This
          function must only be called from a NIF-calling thread, and argument
          <c>env</c> must be the environment of the calling process.</p>
        <p>Returns <c>1</c> if the timeslice is exhausted, otherwise <c>0</c>.
          If <c>1</c> is returned, the NIF is to return as soon as possible in
          order for the process to yield.</p>
        <p>This function is provided to better support co-operative scheduling,
          improve system responsiveness, and make it easier to prevent
          misbehaviors of the VM because of a NIF monopolizing a scheduler
          thread. It can be used to divide <seealso marker="#lengthy_work">
          length work</seealso> into a number of repeated NIF calls without the
          need to create threads.</p>
