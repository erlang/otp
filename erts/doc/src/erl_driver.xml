  <libsummary>API functions for an Erlang driver</libsummary>
  <description>
    <p>An Erlang driver is a library containing a set of native driver
      callback functions that the Erlang VM calls when certain
      events occur. There may be multiple instances of a driver, each
      instance is associated with an Erlang port.</p>
    <marker id="WARNING"/>
      <warning><p><em>Use this functionality with extreme care!</em></p>
      <p>A driver callback is executed as a direct extension of the
      native code of the VM. Execution is not made in a safe environment.
      The VM can <em>not</em> provide the same services as provided when
      executing Erlang code, such as preemptive scheduling or memory
      protection. If the driver callback function doesn't behave well,
      the whole VM will misbehave.</p>
      <list>
	<item><p>A driver callback that crash will crash the whole VM.</p></item>
	<item><p>An erroneously implemented driver callback might cause
	a VM internal state inconsistency which may cause a crash of the VM,
	or miscellaneous misbehaviors of the VM at any point after the call
	to the driver callback.</p></item>
	<item><p>A driver callback that do <seealso marker="#lengthy_work">lengthy
	work</seealso> before returning will degrade responsiveness of the VM,
	and may cause miscellaneous strange behaviors. Such strange behaviors
	include, but are not limited to, extreme memory usage, and bad load
	balancing between schedulers. Strange behaviors that might occur due
	to lengthy work may also vary between OTP releases.</p></item>
      </list>
      </warning>
    <p>As of erts version 5.5.3 the driver interface has been extended
      (see <seealso marker="driver_entry#extended_marker">extended marker</seealso>).
      The extended interface introduce
      <seealso marker="#version_management">version management</seealso>,
      the possibility to pass capability flags
      (see <seealso marker="driver_entry#driver_flags">driver flags</seealso>)
      to the runtime system at driver initialization, and some new
      driver API functions.      </p>
    <note>
      <p>As of erts version 5.9 old drivers have to be recompiled
      and have to use the extended interface. They also have to be
      adjusted to the
      <seealso marker="#rewrites_for_64_bits">64-bit capable driver interface.
      </seealso>
      </p>
    </note>
    <p>The driver calls back to the emulator, using the API
      functions declared in <c>erl_driver.h</c>. They are used for
      outputting data from the driver, using timers, etc.</p>
    <p>Each driver instance is associated with a port. Every port
      has a port owner process. Communication with the port is normally
      done through the port owner process. Most of the functions take
      the <c>port</c> handle as an argument. This identifies the driver
      instance. Note that this port handle must be stored by the driver,
      it is not given when the driver is called from the emulator (see
      <seealso marker="driver_entry#emulator">driver_entry</seealso>).</p>
    <p>Some of the functions take a parameter of type
      <c>ErlDrvBinary</c>, a driver binary. It should be both
      allocated and freed by the caller. Using a binary directly avoids
      one extra copying of data.</p>
    <p>Many of the output functions have a "header buffer", with
      <c>hbuf</c> and <c>hlen</c> parameters. This buffer is sent as a
      list before the binary (or list, depending on port mode) that is
      sent. This is convenient when matching on messages received from
      the port. (Although in the latest versions of Erlang, there is
      the binary syntax, that enables you to match on the beginning of
      a binary.)
            <marker id="smp_support"></marker>
</p>
    <p>In the runtime system with SMP support, drivers are locked either
      on driver level or port level (driver instance level). By default
      driver level locking will be used, i.e., only one emulator thread
      will execute code in the driver at a time. If port level locking
      is used, multiple emulator threads may execute code in the driver
      at the same time. There will only be one thread at a time calling
      driver call-backs corresponding to the same port, though. In order
      to enable port level locking set the <c>ERL_DRV_FLAG_USE_PORT_LOCKING</c>
      <seealso marker="driver_entry#driver_flags">driver flag</seealso> in
      the <seealso marker="driver_entry">driver_entry</seealso>
      used by the driver. When port level locking is used it is the
      responsibility of the driver writer to synchronize all accesses
      to data shared by the ports (driver instances).</p>
    <p>Most drivers written before the runtime system with SMP
      support existed will be able to run in the runtime system
      with SMP support without being rewritten if driver
      level locking is used.</p>
    <note>
      <p>It is assumed that drivers do not access other drivers. If
        drivers should access each other they have to provide their own
        mechanism for thread safe synchronization. Such "inter driver
        communication" is strongly discouraged.</p>
    </note>
    <p>Previously, in the runtime system without SMP support,
      specific driver call-backs were always called from the same
      thread. This is <em>not</em> the case in the runtime system
      with SMP support. Regardless of locking scheme used, calls
      to driver call-backs may be made from different threads, e.g.,
      two consecutive calls to exactly the same call-back for exactly
      the same port may be made from two different threads. This
      will for <em>most</em> drivers not be a problem, but it might.
      Drivers that depend on all call-backs being called in the
      same thread, <em>have</em> to be rewritten before being used
      in the runtime system with SMP support.</p>
    <note>
      <p>Regardless of locking scheme used, calls to driver
        call-backs may be made from different threads.</p>
    </note>
    <p>Most functions in this API are <em>not</em> thread-safe, i.e.,
      they may <em>not</em> be called from an arbitrary thread. Functions
      that are not documented as thread-safe may only be called from
      driver call-backs or function calls descending from a driver
      call-back call. Note that driver call-backs may be called from
      different threads. This, however, is not a problem for any
      function in this API, since the emulator has control over
      these threads.</p>
    <warning>
      <p>Functions not explicitly documented as thread safe are
        <em>not</em> thread safe. Also note that some functions
        are <em>only</em> thread safe when used in a runtime
        system with SMP support.</p>
      <p>A function not explicitly documented as thread safe may at
         some point in time have a thread safe implementation in the
	 runtime system. Such an implementation may however change to
	 a thread <em>unsafe</em> implementation at any time <em>without
	 any notice</em> at all.
      </p>
      <p><em>Only use functions explicitly documented as thread safe
         from arbitrary threads.</em></p>
    </warning>
     <p><marker id="lengthy_work"/>
     As mentioned in the <seealso marker="#WARNING">warning</seealso> text at
     the beginning of this document it is of vital importance that a driver callback
     does return relatively fast. It is hard to give an exact maximum amount
     of time that a driver callback is allowed to work, but as a rule of thumb
     a well behaving driver callback should return before a millisecond has
     passed. This can be achieved using different approaches.
     If you have full control over the code that are to execute in the driver
     callback, the best approach is to divide the work into multiple chunks of
     work and trigger multiple calls to the
     <seealso marker="driver_entry#timeout">timeout callback</seealso> using
     zero timeouts. The
     <seealso marker="#erl_drv_consume_timeslice"><c>erl_drv_consume_timeslice()</c></seealso>
     function can be useful in order to determine when to trigger such
     timeout callback calls. It might, however, not always be possible to
     implement it this way, e.g. when calling third party libraries. In this
     case you typically want to dispatch the work to another thread.
     Information about thread primitives can be found below.</p>

  <section>
    <title>FUNCTIONALITY</title>
    <p>All functions that a driver needs to do with Erlang are
      performed through driver API functions. There are functions
      for the following functionality:</p>
    <taglist>
      <tag>Timer functions</tag>
      <item>Timer functions are used to control the timer that a driver
       may use. The timer will have the emulator call the
       <seealso marker="driver_entry#timeout">timeout</seealso> entry
       function after a specified time. Only one timer is available
       for each driver instance.</item>
      <tag>Queue handling</tag>
      <item>
        <p>Every driver instance has an associated queue. This queue is a
          <c>SysIOVec</c> that works as a buffer. It's mostly used for
          the driver to buffer data that should be written to a device,
          it is a byte stream. If the port owner process closes the
          driver, and the queue is not empty, the driver will not be
          closed. This enables the driver to flush its buffers before
          closing.</p>
        <p>The queue can be manipulated from arbitrary threads if
          a port data lock is used. See documentation of the
          <seealso marker="#ErlDrvPDL">ErlDrvPDL</seealso> type for
          more information.</p>
      </item>
      <tag>Output functions</tag>
      <item>With the output functions, the driver sends data back to
       the emulator. They will be received as messages by the port owner
       process, see <c>open_port/2</c>. The vector function and the
       function taking a driver binary are faster, because they avoid
       copying the data buffer. There is also a fast way of sending
       terms from the driver, without going through the binary term
       format.</item>
      <tag>Failure</tag>
      <item>The driver can exit and signal errors up to Erlang. This is
       only for severe errors, when the driver can't possibly keep
       open.</item>
      <tag>Asynchronous calls</tag>
      <item>The latest Erlang versions (R7B and later) has provision for
       asynchronous function calls, using a thread pool provided by
       Erlang. There is also a select call, that can be used for
       asynchronous drivers.</item>
      <tag><marker id="multi_threading">Multi-threading</marker></tag>
      <item>
      <p>A POSIX thread like API for multi-threading is provided. The
         Erlang driver thread API only provide a subset of the functionality
	 provided by the POSIX thread API. The subset provided is
	 more or less the basic functionality needed for multi-threaded
	 programming:
      </p>
      <list>
	 <item><seealso marker="#ErlDrvTid">Threads</seealso></item>
	 <item><seealso marker="#ErlDrvMutex">Mutexes</seealso></item>
	 <item><seealso marker="#ErlDrvCond">Condition variables</seealso></item>
	 <item><seealso marker="#ErlDrvRWLock">Read/Write locks</seealso></item>
	 <item><seealso marker="#ErlDrvTSDKey">Thread specific data</seealso></item>
      </list>
      <p>The Erlang driver thread API can be used in conjunction with
         the POSIX thread API on UN-ices and with the Windows native thread
	 API on Windows. The Erlang driver thread API has the advantage of
	 being portable, but there might exist situations where you want to
	 use functionality from the POSIX thread API or the Windows
	 native thread API.
      </p>
      <p>The Erlang driver thread API only returns error codes when it is
         reasonable to recover from an error condition. If it isn't reasonable
	 to recover from an error condition, the whole runtime system is
	 terminated. For example, if a create mutex operation fails, an error
	 code is returned, but if a lock operation on a mutex fails, the
	 whole runtime system is terminated.
      </p>
      <p>Note that there exists no "condition variable wait with timeout" in
         the Erlang driver thread API. This is due to issues with
	 <c>pthread_cond_timedwait()</c>. When the system clock suddenly
	 is changed, it isn't always guaranteed that you will wake up from
	 the call as expected. An Erlang runtime system has to be able to
	 cope with sudden changes of the system clock. Therefore, we have
	 omitted it from the Erlang driver thread API. In the Erlang driver
	 case, timeouts can and should be handled with the timer functionality
	 of the Erlang driver API.
      </p>
      <p>In order for the Erlang driver thread API to function, thread
         support has to be enabled in the runtime system. An Erlang driver
	 can check if thread support is enabled by use of
	 <seealso marker="#driver_system_info">driver_system_info()</seealso>.
	 Note that some functions in the Erlang driver API are thread-safe
	 only when the runtime system has SMP support, also this
	 information can be retrieved via
	 <seealso marker="#driver_system_info">driver_system_info()</seealso>.
	 Also note that a lot of functions in the Erlang driver API are
	 <em>not</em> thread-safe regardless of whether SMP support is
	 enabled or not. If a function isn't documented as thread-safe it
	 is <em>not</em> thread-safe.
      </p>
      <p><em>NOTE</em>: When executing in an emulator thread, it is
         <em>very important</em> that you unlock <em>all</em> locks you
	 have locked before letting the thread out of your control;
	 otherwise, you are <em>very likely</em> to deadlock the whole
	 emulator. If you need to use thread specific data in an emulator
	 thread, only have the thread specific data set while the thread is
	 under your control, and clear the thread specific data before
	 you let the thread out of your control.
      </p>
      <p>In the future there will probably be debug functionality
         integrated with the Erlang driver thread API. All functions
	 that create entities take a <c>name</c> argument. Currently
	 the <c>name</c> argument is unused, but it will be used when
	 the debug functionality has been implemented. If you name all
	 entities created well, the debug functionality will be able
	 to give you better error reports.
      </p>

      <tag>Adding / removing drivers</tag>
      <item><p>A driver can add and later remove drivers.</p></item>
      <tag>Monitoring processes</tag>
      <item><p>A driver can monitor a process that does not own a port.</p></item>
      <tag><marker id="version_management">Version management</marker></tag>
      <item>
        <p>Version management is enabled for drivers that have set the
          <seealso marker="driver_entry#extended_marker">extended_marker</seealso>
          field of their
          <seealso marker="driver_entry">driver_entry</seealso>
          to <c>ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MARKER</c>. <c>erl_driver.h</c> defines
          <c>ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MARKER</c>,
          <c>ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MAJOR_VERSION</c>, and
          <c>ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MINOR_VERSION</c>.
          <c>ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MAJOR_VERSION</c> will be incremented when
          driver incompatible changes are made to the Erlang runtime
          system. Normally it will suffice to recompile drivers when the
          <c>ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MAJOR_VERSION</c> has changed, but it
          could, under rare circumstances, mean that drivers have to
          be slightly modified. If so, this will of course be documented.
          <c>ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MINOR_VERSION</c> will be incremented when
          new features are added. The runtime system uses the minor version
          of the driver to determine what features to use.
          The runtime system will normally refuse to load a driver if the major
          versions differ, or if the major versions are equal and the
          minor version used by the driver is greater than the one used
          by the runtime system. Old drivers with lower major versions
	  will however be allowed after a bump of the major version during
	  a transition period of two major releases. Such old drivers might
	  however fail if deprecated features are used.</p>
	<p>The emulator will refuse to load a driver that does not use
	  the extended driver interface,
	  to allow for 64-bit capable drivers,
	  since incompatible type changes for the callbacks
	  <seealso marker="driver_entry#output">output</seealso>,
	  <seealso marker="driver_entry#control">control</seealso> and
	  <seealso marker="driver_entry#call">call</seealso>
	  were introduced in release R15B. A driver written
	  with the old types would compile with warnings and when
	  called return garbage sizes to the emulator causing it
	  to read random memory and create huge incorrect result blobs.</p>
	<p>Therefore it is not enough to just recompile drivers written with
	  version management for pre-R15B types; the types have to be changed
	  in the driver suggesting other rewrites especially regarding
	  size variables. Investigate all warnings when recompiling!</p>
	<p>Also, the API driver functions <c>driver_output*</c>,
	  <c>driver_vec_to_buf</c>, <c>driver_alloc/realloc*</c>
	  and the <c>driver_*</c> queue functions were changed to have
	  larger length arguments and return values. This is a
	  lesser problem since code that passes smaller types
	  will get them auto converted in the calls and as long as
	  the driver does not handle sizes that overflow an <c>int</c>
	  all will work as before.</p>

      REWRITES FOR 64-BIT DRIVER INTERFACE
    </title>
    <p>
      For erts-5.9 two new integer types
      <seealso marker="#ErlDrvSizeT">ErlDrvSizeT</seealso> and
      <seealso marker="#ErlDrvSSizeT">ErlDrvSSizeT</seealso>
      were introduced that can hold 64-bit sizes if necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      To not update a driver and just recompile it probably works
      when building for a 32-bit machine creating a false sense of security.
      Hopefully that will generate many important warnings.
      But when recompiling the same driver later on for a 64-bit machine
      there <em>will</em> be warnings and almost certainly crashes.
      So it is a BAD idea to postpone updating the driver and
      not fixing the warnings!
    </p>
    <p>
      When recompiling with <c>gcc</c> use the <c>-Wstrict-prototypes</c>
      flag to get better warnings. Try to find a similar flag if you
      are using some other compiler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here follows a checklist for rewriting a pre erts-5.9 driver,
      most important first.
    </p>
    <taglist>
      <tag>Return types for driver callbacks</tag>
      <item>
	<p>
	  Rewrite driver callback
	  <c><seealso marker="driver_entry#control">control</seealso></c>
	  to use return type <c>ErlDrvSSizeT</c> instead of <c>int</c>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Rewrite driver callback
	  <c><seealso marker="driver_entry#call">call</seealso></c>
	  to use return type <c>ErlDrvSSizeT</c> instead of <c>int</c>.
	</p>
	<note>
	  <p>
	    These changes are essential to not crash the emulator
	    or worse cause malfunction.
	    Without them a driver may return garbage in the high 32 bits
	    to the emulator causing it to build a huge result from random
	    bytes either crashing on memory allocation or succeeding with
	    a random result from the driver call.
	  </p>
	</note>
      </item>
      <tag>Arguments to driver callbacks</tag>
      <item>
	<p>
	  Driver callback
	  <c><seealso marker="driver_entry#output">output</seealso></c>
	  now gets <c>ErlDrvSizeT</c> as 3rd argument instead
	  of previously <c>int</c>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Driver callback
	  <c><seealso marker="driver_entry#control">control</seealso></c>
	  now gets <c>ErlDrvSizeT</c> as 4th and 6th arguments instead
	  of previously <c>int</c>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Driver callback
	  <c><seealso marker="driver_entry#call">call</seealso></c>
	  now gets <c>ErlDrvSizeT</c> as 4th and 6th arguments instead
	  of previously <c>int</c>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Sane compiler's calling conventions probably make these changes
	  necessary only for a driver to handle data chunks that require
	  64-bit size fields (mostly larger than 2 GB since that is what
	  an <c>int</c> of 32 bits can hold). But it is possible to think
	  of non-sane calling conventions that would make the driver
	  callbacks mix up the arguments causing malfunction.
	</p>
	<note>
	  <p>
	    The argument type change is from signed to unsigned which
	    may cause problems for e.g. loop termination conditions or
	    error conditions if you just change the types all over the place.
	  </p>
	</note>
      </item>
      <tag>Larger <c>size</c> field in <c>ErlIOVec</c></tag>

	<p>
	  The <c>size</c> field in

	  has been changed to <c>ErlDrvSizeT</c> from <c>int</c>.
	  Check all code that use that field.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Automatic type casting probably makes these changes necessary only
	  for a driver that encounters sizes larger than 32 bits.

        <p>The <c>ErlDrvBinary</c> structure is a binary, as sent
          between the emulator and the driver. All binaries are
          reference counted; when <c>driver_binary_free</c> is called,
          the reference count is decremented, when it reaches zero,
          the binary is deallocated. The <c>orig_size</c> is the size
          of the binary, and <c>orig_bytes</c> is the buffer. The
          <c>ErlDrvBinary</c> does not have a fixed size, its size is
          <c>orig_size + 2 * sizeof(int)</c>.</p>
        <note>
          <p>The <c>refc</c> field has been removed. The reference count of
            an <c>ErlDrvBinary</c> is now stored elsewhere. The
            reference count of an <c>ErlDrvBinary</c> can be accessed via
            <seealso marker="#driver_binary_get_refc">driver_binary_get_refc()</seealso>,
            <seealso marker="#driver_binary_inc_refc">driver_binary_inc_refc()</seealso>,
            and
            <seealso marker="#driver_binary_dec_refc">driver_binary_dec_refc()</seealso>.</p>
        </note>
        <p>Some driver calls, such as <c>driver_enq_binary</c>,
          increment the driver reference count, and others, such as
          <c>driver_deq</c> decrement it.</p>
        <p>Using a driver binary instead of a normal buffer, is often
          faster, since the emulator doesn't need to copy the data,
          only the pointer is used.</p>
        <p>A driver binary allocated in the driver, with
          <c>driver_alloc_binary</c>, should be freed in the driver (unless otherwise stated),
          with <c>driver_free_binary</c>. (Note that this doesn't
          necessarily deallocate it, if the driver is still referred
          in the emulator, the ref-count will not go to zero.)</p>
        <p>Driver binaries are used in the <c>driver_output2</c> and
          <c>driver_outputv</c> calls, and in the queue. Also the
          driver call-back <seealso marker="driver_entry#outputv">outputv</seealso> uses driver
          binaries.</p>
        <p>If the driver for some reason or another, wants to keep a
          driver binary around, in a static variable for instance, the
          reference count should be incremented,
          and the binary can later be freed in the <seealso marker="driver_entry#stop">stop</seealso> call-back, with
          <c>driver_free_binary</c>.</p>
        <p>Note that since a driver binary is shared by the driver and
          the emulator, a binary received from the emulator or sent to
          the emulator, must not be changed by the driver.</p>
        <p>Since erts version 5.5 (OTP release R11B), orig_bytes is
          guaranteed to be properly aligned for storage of an array of
          doubles (usually 8-byte aligned).</p>

        <p>If certain port specific data have to be accessed from other
          threads than those calling the driver call-backs, a port data lock
          can be used in order to synchronize the operations on the data.
          Currently, the only port specific data that the emulator
          associates with the port data lock is the driver queue.</p>
        <p>Normally a driver instance does not have a port data lock. If
          the driver instance wants to use a port data lock, it has to
          create the port data lock by calling
          <seealso marker="#driver_pdl_create">driver_pdl_create()</seealso>.
          <em>NOTE</em>: Once the port data lock has been created, every
          access to data associated with the port data lock has to be done
          while having the port data lock locked. The port data lock is
          locked, and unlocked, respectively, by use of
          <seealso marker="#driver_pdl_lock">driver_pdl_lock()</seealso>, and
          <seealso marker="#driver_pdl_unlock">driver_pdl_unlock()</seealso>.</p>
        <p>A port data lock is reference counted, and when the reference
          count reaches zero, it will be destroyed. The emulator will at
          least increment the reference count once when the lock is
          created and decrement it once when the port associated with
          the lock terminates. The emulator will also increment the
          reference count when an async job is enqueued and decrement
          it after an async job has been invoked. Besides
          this, it is the responsibility of the driver to ensure that
          the reference count does not reach zero before the last use
          of the lock by the driver has been made. The reference count
          can be read, incremented, and decremented, respectively, by
          use of
          <seealso marker="#driver_pdl_get_refc">driver_pdl_get_refc()</seealso>,

          the driver up to the emulator. The data will be received as
          terms or binary data, depending on how the driver port was
          opened.</p>
        <p>The data is queued in the port owner process' message
          queue. Note that this does not yield to the emulator. (Since
          the driver and the emulator run in the same thread.)</p>
        <p>The parameter <c>buf</c> points to the data to send, and
          <c>len</c> is the number of bytes.</p>
        <p>The return value for all output functions is 0. (Unless the
          driver is used for distribution, in which case it can fail
          and return -1. For normal use, the output function always

        <p>Note that, using the binary syntax in Erlang, the driver

        <p>If the data is to be sent from the driver to the port owner

        <p>The return value is the space left in the buffer, i.e. if

      <desc>
        <marker id="driver_select"></marker>
        <p>This function is used by drivers to provide the emulator with
          events to check for. This enables the emulator to call the driver
          when something has happened asynchronously.</p>
        <p>The <c>event</c> argument identifies an OS-specific event object.
          On Unix systems, the functions <c>select</c>/<c>poll</c> are used. The
          event object must be a socket or pipe (or other object that
          <c>select</c>/<c>poll</c> can use).
          On windows, the Win32 API function <c>WaitForMultipleObjects</c>
          is used. This places other restrictions on the event object.
          Refer to the Win32 SDK documentation.</p>
        <p>The <c>on</c> parameter should be <c>1</c> for setting events
          and <c>0</c> for clearing them.</p>
        <p>The <c>mode</c> argument is a bitwise-or combination of
          <c>ERL_DRV_READ</c>, <c>ERL_DRV_WRITE</c> and <c>ERL_DRV_USE</c>.
          The first two specify whether to wait for read events and/or write
          events. A fired read event will call
          <seealso marker="driver_entry#ready_input">ready_input</seealso>
          while a fired write event will call
          <seealso marker="driver_entry#ready_output">ready_output</seealso>.
          </p>
    <note>
      <p>Some OS (Windows) do not differentiate between read and write events.
         The call-back for a fired event then only depends on the value of <c>mode</c>.</p>
    </note>
        <p><c>ERL_DRV_USE</c> specifies if we are using the event object or if we want to close it.
           On an emulator with SMP support, it is not safe to clear all events
           and then close the event object after <c>driver_select</c> has
           returned. Another thread may still be using the event object
           internally. To safely close an event object call
           <c>driver_select</c> with <c>ERL_DRV_USE</c> and <c>on==0</c>. That
           will clear all events and then call
           <seealso marker="driver_entry#stop_select">stop_select</seealso>
           when it is safe to close the event object.
           <c>ERL_DRV_USE</c> should be set together with the first event
           for an event object. It is harmless to set <c>ERL_DRV_USE</c>
           even though it already has been done. Clearing all events but keeping
           <c>ERL_DRV_USE</c> set will indicate that we are using the event
           object and probably will set events for it again.</p>
    <note>
      <p>ERL_DRV_USE was added in OTP release R13. Old drivers will still work
         as before. But it is recommended to update them to use <c>ERL_DRV_USE</c> and
         <c>stop_select</c> to make sure that event objects are closed in a safe way.</p>

	<p>Valid limits are values in the range

	Limits will be automatically adjusted to be sane. That is,

	<p>By passing a pointer to an integer variable containing

	limit will be read and written back to the integer variable.
	A new limit can be set by passing a pointer to an integer
	variable containing a valid limit. The passed value will be
	written to the internal limit. The internal limit will then
	be adjusted. After this the adjusted limit will be written
	back to the integer variable from which the new value was

        <p>This functions sends data in the special driver term
          format to the port owner process. This is a fast way to
	  deliver term data from a driver. It also needs no binary
	  conversion, so the port owner process receives data as
	  normal Erlang terms. The
	  <seealso marker="#erl_drv_send_term">erl_drv_send_term()</seealso>
	  functions can be used for sending to any arbitrary process
	  on the local node.</p>
	<note><p>Note that the <c>port</c> parameter is <em>not</em>
	  an ordinary port handle, but a port handle converted using
	  <c>driver_mk_port()</c>.</p></note>
        <p>The <c>term</c> parameter points to an array of
          <c>ErlDrvTermData</c>, with <c>n</c> elements. This array
          contains terms described in the driver term format. Every
          term consists of one to four elements in the array. The
          term first has a term type, and then arguments. The
	  <c>port</c> parameter specifies the sending port.</p>
        <p>Tuples, maps and lists (with the exception of strings, see below),
          are built in reverse polish notation, so that to build a
          tuple, the elements are given first, and then the tuple
          term, with a count. Likewise for lists and maps.</p>
        <p>A tuple must be specified with the number of elements. (The
          elements precede the <c>ERL_DRV_TUPLE</c> term.)</p>
        <p>A list must be specified with the number of elements,
          including the tail, which is the last term preceding
          <c>ERL_DRV_LIST</c>.</p>
        <p>A map must be specified with the number of key-value pairs <c>N</c>.
	  The key-value pairs must precede the <c>ERL_DRV_MAP</c> in this order:
	  <c>key1,value1,key2,value2,...,keyN,valueN</c>.
	  Duplicate keys are not allowed.</p>
        <p>The special term <c>ERL_DRV_STRING_CONS</c> is used to
          "splice" in a string in a list, a string given this way is
          not a list per se, but the elements are elements of the
          surrounding list.</p>

	<p>If you want to pass a binary and don't already have the content

	<c>ERL_DRV_BUF2BINARY</c> instead of creating an <c>ErlDrvBinary</c>
	via <c>driver_alloc_binary()</c> and then pass the binary via
	<c>ERL_DRV_BINARY</c>. The runtime system will often allocate
	binaries smarter if <c>ERL_DRV_BUF2BINARY</c> is used.
	However, if the content of the binary to pass already resides in

        <p>This function performs an asynchronous call. The function
          <c>async_invoke</c> is invoked in a thread separate from the
          emulator thread. This enables the driver to perform
          time-consuming, blocking operations without blocking the
          emulator.</p>
        <p>The async thread pool size can be set with the
          <seealso marker="erl#async_thread_pool_size">+A</seealso>
          command line argument of <seealso marker="erl">erl(1)</seealso>.
          If no async thread pool is available, the call is made
          synchronously in the thread calling <c>driver_async()</c>. The
          current number of async threads in the async thread pool can be
          retrieved via
          <seealso marker="#driver_system_info">driver_system_info()</seealso>.</p>
        <p>If there is a thread pool available, a thread will be
          used. If the <c>key</c> argument is null, the threads from the
          pool are used in a round-robin way, each call to
          <c>driver_async</c> uses the next thread in the pool. With the
          <c>key</c> argument set, this behaviour is changed. The two
          same values of <c>*key</c> always get the same thread.</p>
        <p>To make sure that a driver instance always uses the same
          thread, the following call can be used:</p>
        <p></p>
        <code type="none"><![CDATA[
    unsigned int myKey = driver_async_port_key(myPort);

    r = driver_async(myPort, &myKey, myData, myFunc);
        ]]></code>
        <p>It is enough to initialize <c>myKey</c> once for each
        driver instance.</p>
        <p>If a thread is already working, the calls will be
          queued up and executed in order. Using the same thread for
          each driver instance ensures that the calls will be made in
          sequence.</p>
        <p>The <c>async_data</c> is the argument to the functions
          <c>async_invoke</c> and <c>async_free</c>. It's typically a
          pointer to a structure that contains a pipe or event that
          can be used to signal that the async operation completed.
          The data should be freed in <c>async_free</c>.</p>
        <p>When the async operation is done, <seealso marker="driver_entry#ready_async">ready_async</seealso> driver
          entry function is called. If <c>ready_async</c> is null in

        <p>The return value is -1 if the <c>driver_async</c> call

        <note>
          <p>As of erts version 5.5.4.3 the default stack size for
            threads in the async-thread pool is 16 kilowords,
            i.e., 64 kilobyte on 32-bit architectures.
            This small default size has been chosen since the
            amount of async-threads might be quite large. The
            default stack size is enough for drivers delivered
            with Erlang/OTP, but might not be sufficiently large
            for other dynamically linked in drivers that use the
            driver_async() functionality. A suggested stack size
            for threads in the async-thread pool can be configured
            via the
            <seealso marker="erl#async_thread_stack_size">+a</seealso>
            command line argument of

           will not be called for this new driver instance.

	<p>Give the runtime system a hint about how much CPU time the
	current driver callback call has consumed since last hint, or
	since the start of the callback if no previous hint has been given.
	The time is given as a fraction, in percent, of a full time-slice
	that a port is allowed to execute before it should surrender the
	CPU to other runnable ports or processes. Valid range is
	<c>[1, 100]</c>. The scheduling time-slice is not an exact entity,
	but can usually be approximated to about 1 millisecond.</p>

	<p>Note that it is up to the runtime system to determine if and
	how to	use this information. Implementations on some platforms
	may use other means in order to determine the consumed fraction
	of the time-slice. Lengthy driver callbacks should regardless of
	this frequently call the <c>erl_drv_consume_timeslice()</c>
	function in order to determine if it is allowed to continue
	execution or not.</p>

	<p><c>erl_drv_consume_timeslice()</c> returns a non-zero value
	if the time-slice has been exhausted, and zero if the callback is
	allowed to continue execution. If a non-zero value is
	returned the driver callback should return as soon as possible in
	order for the port to be able to yield.</p>

	<p>This function is provided to better support co-operative scheduling,
	improve system responsiveness, and to make it easier to prevent
	misbehaviors of the VM due to a port monopolizing a scheduler thread.
	It can be used when dividing length work into a number of repeated
	driver callback calls without the need to use threads. Also see the
	important <seealso marker="#WARNING">warning</seealso> text at the
