  <description>
    <p><c>erts_alloc</c> is an Erlang Run-Time System internal memory
      allocator library. <c>erts_alloc</c> provides the Erlang
      Run-Time System with a number of memory allocators.</p>

      <tag><c>mseg_alloc</c></tag>
      <item>A memory segment allocator. <c>mseg_alloc</c> is used by other
       allocators for allocating memory segments and is currently only
       available on systems that have the <c>mmap</c> system
       call. Memory segments that are deallocated are kept for a
       while in a segment cache before they are destroyed. When
       segments are allocated, cached segments are used if possible
       instead of creating new segments.  This in order to reduce
       the number of system calls made.</item>
    </taglist>
    <p><c>sys_alloc</c> is always enabled and
      cannot be disabled. <c>mseg_alloc</c> is always enabled if it is
      available and an allocator that uses it is enabled. All other
      allocators can be <seealso marker="#M_e">enabled or disabled</seealso>.
      By default all allocators are enabled.
      When an allocator is disabled, <c>sys_alloc</c> is used instead of
      the disabled allocator.</p>
    <p>The main idea with the <c>erts_alloc</c> library is to separate
      memory blocks that are used differently into different memory
      areas, and by this achieving less memory fragmentation. By
      putting less effort in finding a good fit for memory blocks that
      are frequently allocated than for those less frequently
      allocated, a performance gain can be achieved.</p>

    <title>The alloc_util framework</title>
    <p>Internally a framework called <c>alloc_util</c> is used for
      implementing allocators. <c>sys_alloc</c>, and
      <c>mseg_alloc</c> do not use this framework; hence, the
      following does <em>not</em> apply to them.</p>
    <p>An allocator manages multiple areas, called carriers, in which
      memory blocks are placed. A carrier is either placed in a
      separate memory segment (allocated via <c>mseg_alloc</c>), or in
      the heap segment (allocated via <c>sys_alloc</c>). Multiblock
      carriers are used for storage of several blocks. Singleblock
      carriers are used for storage of one block. Blocks that are
      larger than the value of the singleblock carrier threshold
      (<seealso marker="#M_sbct">sbct</seealso>) parameter are placed
      in singleblock carriers. Blocks that are smaller than the value
      of the <c>sbct</c> parameter are placed in multiblock
      carriers. Normally an allocator creates a "main multiblock
      carrier". Main multiblock carriers are never deallocated. The
      size of the main multiblock carrier is determined by the value
      of the <seealso marker="#M_mmbcs">mmbcs</seealso> parameter.</p>
    <p><marker id="mseg_mbc_sizes"></marker>Sizes of multiblock carriers
      allocated via <c>mseg_alloc</c> are
      decided based on the values of the largest multiblock carrier
      size (<seealso marker="#M_lmbcs">lmbcs</seealso>), the smallest
      multiblock carrier size (<seealso marker="#M_smbcs">smbcs</seealso>),
      and the multiblock carrier growth stages
      (<seealso marker="#M_mbcgs">mbcgs</seealso>) parameters. If
      <c>nc</c> is the current number of multiblock carriers (the main
      multiblock carrier excluded) managed by an allocator, the size
      of the next <c>mseg_alloc</c> multiblock carrier allocated by
      this allocator will roughly be
      <c><![CDATA[smbcs+nc*(lmbcs-smbcs)/mbcgs]]></c> when
      <c><![CDATA[nc <= mbcgs]]></c>,
      and <c>lmbcs</c> when <c><![CDATA[nc > mbcgs]]></c>. If the value of the
      <c>sbct</c> parameter should be larger than the value of the
      <c>lmbcs</c> parameter, the allocator may have to create
      multiblock carriers that are larger than the value of the
      <c>lmbcs</c> parameter, though.
      Singleblock carriers allocated via <c>mseg_alloc</c> are sized
      to whole pages.</p>
    <p>Sizes of carriers allocated via <c>sys_alloc</c> are
      decided based on the value of the <c>sys_alloc</c> carrier size
      (<seealso marker="#Muycs">ycs</seealso>) parameter. The size of
      a carrier is the least number of multiples of the value of the
      <c>ycs</c> parameter that satisfies the request.</p>
    <p>Coalescing of free blocks are always performed immediately.
      Boundary tags (headers and footers) in free blocks are used
      which makes the time complexity for coalescing constant.</p>
    <p><marker id="strategy"></marker>The memory allocation strategy
      used for multiblock carriers by an
      allocator is configurable via the <seealso marker="#M_as">as</seealso>
      parameter. Currently the following strategies are available:</p>
    <taglist>
      <tag>Best fit</tag>
      <item>
        <p>Strategy: Find the smallest block that satisfies the
          requested block size.</p>
        <p>Implementation: A balanced binary search tree is
          used. The time complexity is proportional to log N, where
          N is the number of sizes of free blocks.</p>
      </item>
      <tag>Address order best fit</tag>
      <item>
        <p>Strategy: Find the smallest block that satisfies the
          requested block size. If multiple blocks are found, choose
          the one with the lowest address.</p>
        <p>Implementation: A balanced binary search tree is
          used. The time complexity is proportional to log N, where
          N is the number of free blocks.</p>
      </item>
      <tag>Address order first fit</tag>
      <item>
        <p>Strategy: Find the block with the lowest address that satisfies the
          requested block size.</p>
        <p>Implementation: A balanced binary search tree is
          used. The time complexity is proportional to log N, where
          N is the number of free blocks.</p>
      </item>
      <tag>Address order first fit carrier best fit</tag>
      <item>
        <p>Strategy: Find the <em>carrier</em> with the lowest address that
	can satisfy the requested block size, then find a block within
	that carrier using the "best fit" strategy.</p>
        <p>Implementation: Balanced binary search trees are
          used. The time complexity is proportional to log N, where
          N is the number of free blocks.</p>
      </item>
      <tag>Address order first fit carrier address order best fit</tag>
      <item>
        <p>Strategy: Find the <em>carrier</em> with the lowest address that
	can satisfy the requested block size, then find a block within
	that carrier using the "adress order best fit" strategy.</p>
        <p>Implementation: Balanced binary search trees are
          used. The time complexity is proportional to log N, where
          N is the number of free blocks.</p>
      </item>
      <tag>Good fit</tag>
      <item>
        <p>Strategy: Try to find the best fit, but settle for the best fit
          found during a limited search.</p>
        <p>Implementation: The implementation uses segregated free
          lists with a maximum block search depth (in each list) in
          order to find a good fit fast. When the maximum block
          search depth is small (by default 3) this implementation
          has a time complexity that is constant. The maximum block
          search depth is configurable via the
          <seealso marker="#M_mbsd">mbsd</seealso> parameter.</p>
      </item>
      <tag>A fit</tag>
      <item>
        <p>Strategy: Do not search for a fit, inspect only one free
          block to see if it satisfies the request. This strategy is
          only intended to be used for temporary allocations.</p>
        <p>Implementation: Inspect the first block in a free-list.
          If it satisfies the request, it is used; otherwise, a new
          carrier is created. The implementation has a time
          complexity that is constant.</p>
	<p>As of erts version 5.6.1 the emulator will refuse to
	  use this strategy on other allocators than <c>temp_alloc</c>.
	  This since it will only cause problems for other allocators.</p>
      </item>
    </taglist>
    <p>Apart from the ordinary allocators described above a number of
       pre-allocators are used for some specific data types. These
       pre-allocators pre-allocate a fixed amount of memory for certain data
       types when the run-time system starts. As long as pre-allocated memory
       is available, it will be used. When no pre-allocated memory is
       available, memory will be allocated in ordinary allocators. These
       pre-allocators are typically much faster than the ordinary allocators,
       but can only satisfy a limited amount of requests.</p>

    <title>System Flags Effecting erts_alloc</title>
    <warning>
      <p>Only use these flags if you are absolutely sure what you are
        doing. Unsuitable settings may cause serious performance
        degradation and even a system crash at any time during
        operation.</p>
    </warning>
    <p>Memory allocator system flags have the following syntax:
      <c><![CDATA[+M<S><P> <V>]]></c>
      where <c><![CDATA[<S>]]></c> is a letter identifying a subsystem,
      <c><![CDATA[<P>]]></c> is a parameter, and <c><![CDATA[<V>]]></c> is the
      value to use. The flags can be passed to the Erlang emulator
      (<seealso marker="erl">erl</seealso>) as command line
      arguments.</p>
    <p>System flags effecting specific allocators have an upper-case
      letter as <c><![CDATA[<S>]]></c>. The following letters are used for
      the currently present allocators:</p>

       Absolute max cache bad fit (in kilobytes). A segment in the
       memory segment cache is not reused if its size exceeds the
       requested size with more than the value of this
       parameter. Default value is 4096. </item>
      <tag><marker id="MMrmcbf"/><c><![CDATA[+MMrmcbf <ratio>]]></c></tag>
      <item>
       Relative max cache bad fit (in percent). A segment in the

      <item>
	Set <seealso marker="#MMscs">super carrier</seealso> only flag. This
	flag defaults to <c>true</c>. When a super carrier is used and this
	flag is <c>true</c>, <c>mseg_alloc</c> will only create carriers
	in the super carrier. Note that the <c>alloc_util</c> framework may
	create <c>sys_alloc</c> carriers, so if you want all carriers to
	be created in the super carrier, you therefore want to disable use
	of <c>sys_alloc</c> carriers by also passing
	<seealso marker="#Musac"><c>+Musac false</c></seealso>. When the flag
	is <c>false</c>, <c>mseg_alloc</c> will try to create carriers outside
	of the super carrier when the super carrier is full.
	<br/><br/>
	<em>NOTE</em>: Setting this flag to <c>false</c> may not be supported
	on all systems. This flag will in that case be ignored.
	<br/><br/>
	<em>NOTE</em>: The super carrier cannot be enabled nor
	disabled on halfword heap systems. This flag will be
	ignored on halfword heap systems.
      </item>
      <tag><marker id="MMscrfsd"/><c><![CDATA[+MMscrfsd <amount>]]></c></tag>
      <item>
	Set <seealso marker="#MMscs">super carrier</seealso> reserved
	free segment descriptors. This parameter defaults to <c>65536</c>.
	This parameter determines the amount of memory to reserve for
	free segment descriptors used by the super carrier. If the system
	runs out of reserved memory for free segment descriptors, other
	memory will be used. This may however cause fragmentation issues,
	so you want to ensure that this	never happens. The maximum amount
	of free segment descriptors used can be retrieved from the
	<c>erts_mmap</c> tuple part of the result from calling
	<seealso marker="erts:erlang#system_info_allocator_tuple">erlang:system_info({allocator, mseg_alloc})</seealso>.
      </item>

      <item>
	Set <seealso marker="#MMscs">super carrier</seealso> reserve physical
	memory flag. This flag defaults	to <c>true</c>. When this flag is
	<c>true</c>, physical memory will be reserved for the whole super
	carrier at once when it is created. The reservation will after that
	be left unchanged. When this flag is set to <c>false</c> only virtual
	address space will be reserved for the super carrier upon creation.
	The system will attempt to reserve physical memory upon carrier
	creations in the super carrier, and attempt to unreserve physical
	memory upon carrier destructions in the super carrier.
	<br/><br/>
	<em>NOTE</em>: What reservation of physical memory actually means
	highly depends on the operating system, and how it is configured. For
	example, different memory overcommit settings on Linux drastically
	change the behaviour. Also note, setting this flag to <c>false</c>
	may not be supported on all systems. This flag will in that case
	be ignored.
	<br/><br/>
	<em>NOTE</em>: The super carrier cannot be enabled nor
	disabled on halfword heap systems. This flag will be
	ignored on halfword heap systems.

      <item>
	Set super carrier size (in MB). The super carrier size defaults to
	zero; i.e, the super carrier is by default disabled. The super
	carrier is a large continuous area in the virtual address space.
	<c>mseg_alloc</c> will always try to create new carriers in the super
	carrier if it exists. Note that the <c>alloc_util</c> framework may
	create <c>sys_alloc</c> carriers. For more information on this, see the

      <tag><marker id="M_acul"/><c><![CDATA[+M<S>acul <utilization>|de]]></c></tag>
      <item>
	Abandon carrier utilization limit. A valid
	<c><![CDATA[<utilization>]]></c> is an integer in the range
	<c>[0, 100]</c> representing utilization in percent. When a
	utilization value larger than zero is used, allocator instances
	are allowed to abandon multiblock carriers. If <c>de</c> (default
	enabled) is passed instead of a <c><![CDATA[<utilization>]]></c>,
	a recomended non zero utilization value will be used. The actual
	value chosen depend on allocator type and may be changed between
	ERTS versions. Currently the default equals <c>de</c>, but this
	may be changed in the future. Carriers will be abandoned when
	memory utilization in the allocator instance falls below the
	utilization value used. Once a carrier has been abandoned, no new
	allocations will be made in it. When an allocator instance gets an
	increased multiblock carrier need, it will first try to fetch an
	abandoned carrier from an allocator instances of the same
	allocator type. If no abandoned carrier could be fetched, it will
	create a new empty carrier. When an abandoned carrier has been
	fetched it will function as an ordinary carrier. This feature has
	special requirements on the
	<seealso marker="#M_as">allocation strategy</seealso> used. Currently
	only the strategies <c>aoff</c>, <c>aoffcbf</c> and <c>aoffcaobf</c> support
	abandoned carriers. This feature also requires
	<seealso marker="#M_t">multiple thread specific instances</seealso>
	to be enabled. When enabling this feature, multiple thread specific
	instances will be enabled if not already enabled, and the
	<c>aoffcbf</c> strategy will be enabled if current strategy does not
	support abandoned carriers. This feature can be enabled on all
	allocators based on the <c>alloc_util</c> framework with the
	exception of <c>temp_alloc</c> (which would be pointless).

       This option will only have any effect on the runtime system

       a lock-free instance of its own and other threads will use
