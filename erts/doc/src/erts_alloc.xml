  <description>
    <p><c>erts_alloc</c> is an Erlang Run-Time System internal memory
      allocator library. <c>erts_alloc</c> provides the Erlang
      Run-Time System with a number of memory allocators.</p>

      <item>This is normally the default <c>malloc</c> implementation
       used on the specific OS.</item>
      <tag><c>mseg_alloc</c></tag>
      <item>A memory segment allocator. <c>mseg_alloc</c> is used by other
       allocators for allocating memory segments and is currently only
       available on systems that have the <c>mmap</c> system
       call. Memory segments that are deallocated are kept for a
       while in a segment cache before they are destroyed. When
       segments are allocated, cached segments are used if possible
       instead of creating new segments.  This in order to reduce
       the number of system calls made.</item>
      <tag><c>sbmbc_alloc</c></tag>
      <item>Allocator used by other allocators for allocation of carriers
      where only small blocks are placed. Currently this allocator is
      disabled by default.</item>
    </taglist>
    <p><c>sys_alloc</c> is always enabled and
      cannot be disabled. <c>mseg_alloc</c> is always enabled if it is
      available and an allocator that uses it is enabled. All other
      allocators can be <seealso marker="#M_e">enabled or disabled</seealso>.
      By default all allocators are enabled.
      When an allocator is disabled, <c>sys_alloc</c> is used instead of
      the disabled allocator. <c>sbmbc_alloc</c> is an exception. If
      <c>sbmbc_alloc</c> is disabled, other allocators will not handle
      small blocks in separate carriers.</p>
    <p>The main idea with the <c>erts_alloc</c> library is to separate
      memory blocks that are used differently into different memory
      areas, and by this achieving less memory fragmentation. By
      putting less effort in finding a good fit for memory blocks that
      are frequently allocated than for those less frequently
      allocated, a performance gain can be achieved.</p>

    <title>The alloc_util framework</title>
    <p>Internally a framework called <c>alloc_util</c> is used for
      implementing allocators. <c>sys_alloc</c>, and
      <c>mseg_alloc</c> do not use this framework; hence, the
      following does <em>not</em> apply to them.</p>
    <p>An allocator manages multiple areas, called carriers, in which
      memory blocks are placed. A carrier is either placed in a
      separate memory segment (allocated via <c>mseg_alloc</c>), in
      the heap segment (allocated via <c>sys_alloc</c>), or inside
      another carrier (in case it is a carrier created by
      <c>sbmbc_alloc</c>). Multiblock
      carriers are used for storage of several blocks. Singleblock
      carriers are used for storage of one block. Blocks that are
      larger than the value of the singleblock carrier threshold
      (<seealso marker="#M_sbct">sbct</seealso>) parameter are placed
      in singleblock carriers. Blocks that are smaller than the value
      of the <c>sbct</c> parameter are placed in multiblock
      carriers. Blocks that are smaller than the small block multiblock
      carrier threshold (<seealso marker="#M_sbmbct">sbmbct</seealso>)
      will be placed in multiblock carriers only used for small blocks.
      Normally an allocator creates a "main multiblock
      carrier". Main multiblock carriers are never deallocated. The
      size of the main multiblock carrier is determined by the value
      of the <seealso marker="#M_mmbcs">mmbcs</seealso> parameter.</p>
    <p><marker id="mseg_mbc_sizes"></marker>Sizes of multiblock carriers
      allocated via <c>mseg_alloc</c> are
      decided based on the values of the largest multiblock carrier
      size (<seealso marker="#M_lmbcs">lmbcs</seealso>), the smallest
      multiblock carrier size (<seealso marker="#M_smbcs">smbcs</seealso>),
      and the multiblock carrier growth stages
      (<seealso marker="#M_mbcgs">mbcgs</seealso>) parameters. If
      <c>nc</c> is the current number of multiblock carriers (the main
      multiblock carrier excluded) managed by an allocator, the size
      of the next <c>mseg_alloc</c> multiblock carrier allocated by
      this allocator will roughly be
      <c><![CDATA[smbcs+nc*(lmbcs-smbcs)/mbcgs]]></c> when
      <c><![CDATA[nc <= mbcgs]]></c>,
      and <c>lmbcs</c> when <c><![CDATA[nc > mbcgs]]></c>. If the value of the
      <c>sbct</c> parameter should be larger than the value of the
      <c>lmbcs</c> parameter, the allocator may have to create
      multiblock carriers that are larger than the value of the
      <c>lmbcs</c> parameter, though. The size of multiblock carriers
      for small blocks is determined by the small block multiblock
      carrier size (<seealso marker="#M_sbmbcs">sbmbcs</seealso>).
      Singleblock carriers allocated via <c>mseg_alloc</c> are sized
      to whole pages.</p>
    <p>Sizes of carriers allocated via <c>sys_alloc</c> are
      decided based on the value of the <c>sys_alloc</c> carrier size
      (<seealso marker="#Muycs">ycs</seealso>) parameter. The size of
      a carrier is the least number of multiples of the value of the
      <c>ycs</c> parameter that satisfies the request.</p>
    <p>Coalescing of free blocks are always performed immediately.
      Boundary tags (headers and footers) in free blocks are used
      which makes the time complexity for coalescing constant.</p>
    <p><marker id="strategy"></marker>The memory allocation strategy
      used for multiblock carriers by an
      allocator is configurable via the <seealso marker="#M_as">as</seealso>
      parameter. Currently the following strategies are available:</p>
    <taglist>
      <tag>Best fit</tag>
      <item>
        <p>Strategy: Find the smallest block that satisfies the
          requested block size.</p>
        <p>Implementation: A balanced binary search tree is
          used. The time complexity is proportional to log N, where
          N is the number of sizes of free blocks.</p>
      </item>
      <tag>Address order best fit</tag>
      <item>
        <p>Strategy: Find the smallest block that satisfies the
          requested block size. If multiple blocks are found, choose
          the one with the lowest address.</p>
        <p>Implementation: A balanced binary search tree is
          used. The time complexity is proportional to log N, where
          N is the number of free blocks.</p>
      </item>
      <tag>Address order first fit</tag>
      <item>
        <p>Strategy: Find the block with the lowest address that satisfies the
          requested block size.</p>
        <p>Implementation: A balanced binary search tree is
          used. The time complexity is proportional to log N, where
          N is the number of free blocks.</p>
      </item>
      <tag>Good fit</tag>
      <item>
        <p>Strategy: Try to find the best fit, but settle for the best fit
          found during a limited search.</p>
        <p>Implementation: The implementation uses segregated free
          lists with a maximum block search depth (in each list) in
          order to find a good fit fast. When the maximum block
          search depth is small (by default 3) this implementation
          has a time complexity that is constant. The maximum block
          search depth is configurable via the
          <seealso marker="#M_mbsd">mbsd</seealso> parameter.</p>
      </item>
      <tag>A fit</tag>
      <item>
        <p>Strategy: Do not search for a fit, inspect only one free
          block to see if it satisfies the request. This strategy is
          only intended to be used for temporary allocations.</p>
        <p>Implementation: Inspect the first block in a free-list.
          If it satisfies the request, it is used; otherwise, a new
          carrier is created. The implementation has a time
          complexity that is constant.</p>
	<p>As of erts version 5.6.1 the emulator will refuse to
	  use this strategy on other allocators than <c>temp_alloc</c>.
	  This since it will only cause problems for other allocators.</p>
      </item>
    </taglist>
    <p>Apart from the ordinary allocators described above a number of
       pre-allocators are used for some specific data types. These
       pre-allocators pre-allocate a fixed amount of memory for certain data
       types when the run-time system starts. As long as there are available
       pre-allocated memory, it will be used. When no pre-allocated memory is
       available, memory will be allocated in ordinary allocators. These
       pre-allocators are typically much faster than the ordinary allocators,
       but can only satisfy a limited amount of requests.</p>
  </section>

  <note><p>
    Currently only allocators using the best fit and the address order
    best fit strategies are able to use "small block multi block carriers".

       Multiple, thread specific instances of the allocator.
       This option will only have any effect on the runtime system
       with SMP support. Default behaviour on the runtime system with
       SMP support:
       <taglist>
         <tag><c>ll_alloc</c></tag>
	 <item><c>1</c> instance.</item>
         <tag>Other allocators</tag>
	 <item><c>NoSchedulers+1</c> instances. Each scheduler will use
	 a lock-free instance of its own and other threads will use
	 a common instance.</item>
       </taglist>
       It was previously (before ERTS version 5.9) possible to configure
       a smaller amount of thread specific instances than schedulers.
       This is, however, not possible any more.

    <p>Currently the following flags are available for configuration of

      <tag><marker id="Muycs"><c><![CDATA[+Muycs <size>]]></c></marker></tag>
      <item>
      <c>sys_alloc</c> carrier size. Carriers allocated via
      <c>sys_alloc</c> will be allocated in sizes which are
       multiples of the <c>sys_alloc</c> carrier size. This is not
       true for main multiblock carriers and carriers allocated
       during a memory shortage, though.</item>

       Max <c>mseg_alloc</c> carriers. Maximum number of carriers
