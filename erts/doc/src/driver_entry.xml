      <p><em>Use this functionality with extreme care.</em></p>
      <p>A driver callback is executed as a direct extension of the
        native code of the VM. Execution is not made in a safe environment.
        The VM <em>cannot</em> provide the same services as provided when
        executing Erlang code, such as pre-emptive scheduling or memory
        protection. If the driver callback function does not behave well,
        the whole VM will misbehave.</p>
      <list type="bulleted">
        <item>
          <p>A driver callback that crash will crash the whole VM.</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>An erroneously implemented driver callback can cause a VM
            internal state inconsistency, which can cause a crash of the VM,
            or miscellaneous misbehaviors of the VM at any point after the
            call to the driver callback.</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>A driver callback doing
            <seealso marker="erl_driver#lengthy_work">lengthy work</seealso>
            before returning degrades responsiveness of the VM, and can cause
            miscellaneous strange behaviors. Such strange behaviors
            include, but are not limited to, extreme memory usage, and bad
            load balancing between schedulers. Strange behaviors that can
            occur because of lengthy work can also vary between Erlang/OTP
            releases.</p>
        </item>
      </list>
    </warning>

    <p>As from ERTS 5.9 (Erlang/OTP R15B) the driver interface
      has been changed with larger types for the callbacks
      <seealso marker="#output"><c>output</c></seealso>,
      <seealso marker="#control"><c>control</c></seealso>, and
      <seealso marker="#call"><c>call</c></seealso>.
      See driver <seealso marker="erl_driver#version_management">
      version management</seealso> in
      <seealso marker="erl_driver"><c>erl_driver</c></seealso>.</p>

    <note>
      <p>Old drivers (compiled with an <c>erl_driver.h</c> from an
        ERTS version earlier than 5.9) must be updated and have
        to use the extended interface (with
        <seealso marker="erl_driver#version_management">version management
        </seealso>).</p>
    </note>

    <p>The <c>driver_entry</c> structure is a C struct that all Erlang
      drivers define. It contains entry points for the Erlang driver,
      which are called by the Erlang emulator when Erlang code accesses
      the driver.</p>

    <p><marker id="emulator"></marker>
      The <seealso marker="erl_driver"><c>erl_driver</c></seealso> driver
      API functions need a port handle
      that identifies the driver instance (and the port in the
      emulator). This is only passed to the <c>start</c> function, but
      not to the other functions. The <c>start</c> function returns a
      driver-defined handle that is passed to the other functions. A
      common practice is to have the <c>start</c> function allocate
      some application-defined structure and stash the <c>port</c>
      handle in it, to use it later with the driver API functions.</p>

    <p>The driver callback functions are called synchronously from the
      Erlang emulator. If they take too long before completing, they
      can cause time-outs in the emulator. Use the queue or
      asynchronous calls if necessary, as the emulator must be
      responsive.</p>

    <p>The driver structure contains the driver name and some
      15 function pointers, which are called at different
      times by the emulator.</p>

    <p>The only exported function from the driver is
      <c>driver_init</c>. This function returns the <c>driver_entry</c>
      structure that points to the other functions in the driver. The
      <c>driver_init</c> function is declared with a macro,
      <c>DRIVER_INIT(drivername)</c>. (This is because different
      operating systems have different names for it.)</p>

    <p>When writing a driver in C++, the driver entry is to be of
      <c>"C"</c> linkage. One way to do this is to put the
      following line somewhere before the driver entry:</p>

    <pre>
extern "C" DRIVER_INIT(drivername);</pre>

    <p>When the driver has passed the <c>driver_entry</c> over to
      the emulator, the driver is <em>not</em> allowed to modify the
      <c>driver_entry</c>.</p>

    <p>If compiling a driver for static inclusion through
      <c>--enable-static-drivers</c>, you must define
      <c>STATIC_ERLANG_DRIVER</c> before the <c>DRIVER_INIT</c> declaration.</p>

    <note>
      <p>Do <em>not</em> declare the <c>driver_entry</c> <c>const</c>.
        This because the emulator must
        modify the <c>handle</c> and the <c>handle2</c>
        fields. A statically allocated, and <c>const</c>-declared
        <c>driver_entry</c> can be located in
        read-only memory, which causes the emulator to crash.</p>

      <item>
        <p>Called when a driver event (specified in parameter
          <c>event</c>) is signaled. This is used to help
          asynchronous drivers "wake up" when something occurs.</p>
        <p>On Unix the <c>event</c> is a pipe or socket handle (or
          something that the <c>select</c> system call understands).</p>
        <p>On Windows the <c>event</c> is an <c>Event</c> or <c>Semaphore</c>
          (or something that the <c>WaitForMultipleObjects</c> API
          function understands). (Some trickery in the emulator allows
          more than the built-in limit of 64 <c>Events</c> to be used.)</p>
        <p>To use this with threads and asynchronous routines, create a
          pipe on Unix and an <c>Event</c> on Windows. When the routine
          completes, write to the pipe (use <c>SetEvent</c> on
          Windows), this makes the emulator call
          <c>ready_input</c> or <c>ready_output</c>.</p>
        <p>False events can occur. That is, calls to <c>ready_input</c>
          or <c>ready_output</c> although no real events are signaled. In
          reality, it is rare (and OS-dependant), but a robust driver
          must nevertheless be able to handle such cases.</p>

      <tag><marker id="driver_name"/><c>char *driver_name</c></tag>
      <item>
        <p>The driver name. It must correspond to the atom used in

      <item>
        <p>Called by the <c>erl_ddll</c> driver when the
          driver is unloaded. (It is only called in dynamic drivers.)</p>
        <p>The driver is only unloaded as a result of calling
          <seealso marker="kernel:erl_ddll#unload_driver/1">
          <c>erl_ddll:unload_driver/1</c></seealso>,
          or when the emulator halts.</p>
      </item>
      <tag><c>void *handle</c></tag>
      <item>
        <p>This field is reserved for the emulator's internal use. The
          emulator will modify this field, so it is important
          that the <c>driver_entry</c> is not declared <c>const</c>.</p> 
      </item>
      <tag><marker id="control"></marker>
        <c>ErlDrvSSizeT (*control)(ErlDrvData drv_data, unsigned int command,
        char *buf, ErlDrvSizeT len, char **rbuf, ErlDrvSizeT rlen)</c></tag>
      <item>
        <p>A special routine invoked with
          <seealso marker="erlang#port_control/3">
          <c>erlang:port_control/3</c></seealso>.
          It works a little like an "ioctl" for
          Erlang drivers. The data specified to <c>port_control/3</c>
          arrives in <c>buf</c> and <c>len</c>. The driver can send
          data back, using <c>*rbuf</c> and <c>rlen</c>.</p>
        <p>This is the fastest way of calling a driver and get a
          response. It makes no context switch in the Erlang
          emulator and requires no message passing. It is suitable
          for calling C function to get faster execution, when Erlang
          is too slow.</p>
        <p>If the driver wants to return data, it is to return it in
          <c>rbuf</c>. When <c>control</c> is called,
          <c>*rbuf</c> points to a default buffer of <c>rlen</c> bytes, which
          can be used to return data. Data is returned differently depending on
          the port control flags (those that are set with
          <seealso marker="erl_driver#set_port_control_flags">
          <c>erl_driver:set_port_control_flags</c></seealso>).</p>
        <p>If the flag is set to <c>PORT_CONTROL_FLAG_BINARY</c>,
          a binary is returned. Small binaries can be returned by writing
          the raw data into the default buffer. A binary can also be
          returned by setting <c>*rbuf</c> to point to a binary allocated with
          <seealso marker="erl_driver#driver_alloc_binary">
          <c>erl_driver:driver_alloc_binary</c></seealso>.
          This binary is freed automatically after <c>control</c> has returned.
          The driver can retain the binary for <em>read only</em> access with
          <seealso marker="erl_driver#driver_binary_inc_refc">
          <c>erl_driver:driver_binary_inc_refc</c></seealso> to be freed later
          with <seealso marker="erl_driver#driver_free_binary">
          <c>erl_driver:driver_free_binary</c></seealso>.
          It is never allowed to change the binary after <c>control</c> has
          returned. If <c>*rbuf</c> is set to <c>NULL</c>, an empty list is
          returned.</p>
        <p>If the flag is set to <c>0</c>, data is returned as a
          list of integers. Either use the default buffer or set
          <c>*rbuf</c> to point to a larger buffer allocated with
          <seealso marker="erl_driver#driver_alloc">
          <c>erl_driver:driver_alloc</c></seealso>. The
          buffer is freed automatically after <c>control</c> has returned.</p>
        <p>Using binaries is faster if more than a few bytes are returned.</p>
        <p>The return value is the number of bytes returned in <c>*rbuf</c>.</p>
      </item>
      <tag><marker id="timeout"/><c>void (*timeout)(ErlDrvData drv_data)</c>

      <item>

          The timer is activated with

          <c>erl_driver:driver_set_timer</c></seealso>. No priorities or

          instead. This function is faster than <c>output</c>, as
          it takes an <c>ErlIOVec</c> directly, which requires no
          copying of the data. The port is to be in binary mode, see
          <seealso marker="erlang#open_port/2">
          <c>erlang:open_port/2</c></seealso>.</p>
        <p><c>ErlIOVec</c> contains both a <c>SysIOVec</c>,
          suitable for <c>writev</c>, and one or more binaries. If
          these binaries are to be retained when the driver returns
          from <c>outputv</c>, they can be queued (using, for example,
          <seealso marker="erl_driver#driver_enq_bin">
          <c>erl_driver:driver_enq_bin</c></seealso>)
          or, if they are kept in a static or global
          variable, the reference counter can be incremented.</p>

      <item>
        <p>Called after an asynchronous call has completed.
          The asynchronous call is started with
          <seealso marker="erl_driver#driver_async">
          <c>erl_driver:driver_async</c></seealso>.
          This function is called from the Erlang emulator thread, as

      <tag><c>void (*flush)(ErlDrvData drv_data)</c></tag>
      <item>
        <p>Called when the port is about to be closed,

          before 'stop' can be called.</p>

        <p>Called from <seealso marker="erlang#port_call/3">
          <c>erlang:port_call/3</c></seealso>.
          It works a lot like the <c>control</c> callback, but uses the
          external term format for input and output.</p>
        <p><c>command</c> is an integer, obtained from the call from
          Erlang (the second argument to <c>erlang:port_call/3</c>).</p>
        <p><c>buf</c> and <c>len</c> provide the arguments to the call
          (the third argument to <c>erlang:port_call/3</c>). They can
          be decoded using <c>ei</c> functions.</p>
        <p><c>rbuf</c> points to a return buffer, <c>rlen</c> bytes
          long. The return data is to be a valid Erlang term in the
          external (binary) format. This is converted to an Erlang
          term and returned by <c>erlang:port_call/3</c> to the
          caller. If more space than <c>rlen</c> bytes is needed to
          return data, <c>*rbuf</c> can be set to memory allocated with
          <seealso marker="erl_driver#driver_alloc">
          <c>erl_driver:driver_alloc</c></seealso>.
          This memory is freed automatically after <c>call</c> has returned.</p>
        <p>The return value is the number of bytes returned in
          <c>*rbuf</c>. If <c>ERL_DRV_ERROR_GENERAL</c> is returned
          (or in fact, anything &lt; 0), <c>erlang:port_call/3</c>
          throws a <c>BAD_ARG</c>.</p>

          <item>
            <p>The runtime system uses port-level locking on
              all ports executing this driver instead of driver-level
              locking when the driver is run in a runtime
              system with SMP support. For more information, see

              As from ERTS 5.7.4 this flag is required for drivers used

        <p>This field is reserved for the emulator's internal use. The

      <item>
        <p>Called when a monitored process exits. The
          <c>drv_data</c> is the data associated with the port for which

          and the <c>monitor</c> corresponds to the <c>ErlDrvMonitor</c>

          <seealso marker="erl_driver#driver_get_monitored_process">
          <c>erl_driver:driver_get_monitored_process</c></seealso>

          <seealso marker="erl_driver#driver_select">
          <c>erl_driver:driver_select</c></seealso>
          when it is safe to close an event object.</p>
        <p>A typical implementation on Unix is to do
          <c>close((int)event)</c>.</p>
        <p>Argument <c>reserved</c> is intended for future use and is to be
          ignored.</p>
        <p>In contrast to most of the other callback functions,
          <c>stop_select</c> is called independent of any port. No
          <c>ErlDrvData</c> argument is passed to the function. No
          driver lock or port lock is guaranteed to be held. The port that
          called <c>driver_select</c> can even be closed at the
          time <c>stop_select</c> is called. But it can also be
          the case that <c>stop_select</c> is called directly by
          <c>erl_driver:driver_select</c>.</p>
        <p>It is not allowed to call any functions in the
          <seealso marker="erl_driver">driver API</seealso> from
          <c>stop_select</c>. This strict limitation is because the
          volatile context that <c>stop_select</c> can be called.</p>
