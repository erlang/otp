# ERTS Release Notes

This document describes the changes made to the ERTS application.

## Erts 16.1.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixed the `erl` documentation of the default timewarp mode used.

  Own Id: OTP-19790 Aux Id: [PR-9970]

- The `erlang:suspend_process()` BIFs failed to suspend processes currently executing on dirty schedulers.

  Own Id: OTP-19799 Aux Id: [PR-10241]

[PR-9970]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/9970
[PR-10241]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/10241

## Erts 16.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Made sure to not set any terminal settings when they have not been changed. Doing so can trigger a SIGTTOU signal which would terminate Erlang when it should not.

  Own Id: OTP-19685 Aux Id: [PR-9906]

- As an optimization, when the `unicode:characters_to_binary/3` was used to convert from `latin1` to `utf8` or vice versa, it would return the original binary unchanged if it only contained 7-bit ASCII characters. That otpimization was broken in Erlang/OTP 27, and has now been mended.

  Own Id: OTP-19728 Aux Id: [GH-10072], [PR-10093]

[PR-9906]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/9906
[GH-10072]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues/10072
[PR-10093]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/10093

### Improvements and New Features

- Fixed C compiler warnings generated by codechecker.

  Own Id: OTP-19671 Aux Id: [PR-9832]

- Added support in module `re` for export and import of compiled regular expression in order to safely move them between Erlang node instances.

  Own Id: OTP-19730 Aux Id: [PR-9976]

- Added new `erl` command line flag `+Mumadtn <bool>` causing `MADV_DONTNEED` to be passed to `madvise()` instead of `MADV_FREE`.

  Own Id: OTP-19755 Aux Id: [CVE-2025-58050]

- Fixed bug that could cause crash in beam started with `erl -emu_type debug +JPperf true` with any type of tracing return from function.

  Own Id: OTP-19761 Aux Id: [PR-19755]

[CVE-2025-58050]: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/2025-58050
[PR-19755]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/19755

## Erts 16.0.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- prim_net nif used incorrect encoding for family resulting in non-functional address selection.

  Own Id: OTP-19674

- Fix windows uninstall command.

  Own Id: OTP-19683 Aux Id: [PR-9887], [GH-9992], [GH-9884]

- With this change erlang will start if it receives short (ms-dos compatible) path to executable.

[PR-9887]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/9887
[GH-9992]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues/9992
[GH-9884]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues/9884
[PR-9996]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/9996

### Improvements and New Features

- The maximum amount of connections for `epmd` on Windows platforms has been increased from 64 to 1024.

  Own Id: OTP-19710 Aux Id: [PR-10039]

[PR-10039]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/10039

## Erts 16.0.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fix Erlang to not crash when `t:io:standard_error/0` is a terminal but `t:io:standard_io/0` is not. This bug has existed since Erlang/OTP 28.0 and only effects Windows.

  Own Id: OTP-19650 Aux Id: [GH-9872], [PR-9878]

- In a debug build, the BIFs for the native debugger could cause a lock order violation diagnostic from the lock checker.

  Own Id: OTP-19665 Aux Id: [PR-9926]

- When building ERTS make sure correct `pcre2.h` file is included even if CFLAGS contains extra include paths.

  Own Id: OTP-19675 Aux Id: [PR-9892]

[GH-9872]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues/9872
[PR-9878]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/9878
[PR-9926]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/9926
[PR-9892]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/9892

## Erts 16.0

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- ETS tables with more than 2 billion keys are now supported.

  Own Id: OTP-19144 Aux Id: [PR-8589]

- The zlib library included in Erlang/OTP has been updated to version 1.3.1.

  Own Id: OTP-19259 Aux Id: [PR-8862]

- [`to_erl`](`e:system:embedded.md#to_erl`) no longer clears the screen when attaching to a [`run_erl`](run_erl_cmd.md) session.

  Own Id: OTP-19263 Aux Id: [PR-8943]

- The size of an atom in the Erlang source code was limited to 255 bytes in previous releases, meaning that an atom containing only emojis could contain only 63 emojis.
  
  While atoms are still only allowed to contain 255 characters, the number of bytes is no longer limited.
  
  External tools that parse the `AtU8` chunk of a BEAM file directly need to be updated. Tools that use [`beam_lib:chunks(Beam, [atoms])`](`beam_lib:chunks/2`) to read the atom table will continue to work.

  *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

  Own Id: OTP-19285 Aux Id: [PR-8913]

- Fixed a bug where [`erlc`](erlc_cmd.md) would crash if its path contained spaces.

  Own Id: OTP-19295 Aux Id: [PR-8937]

- The [`-noshell`](erl_cmd.md#noshell) mode has been updated to read data lazily from standard input. Before this fix any data would be read greedily which meant that Erlang could consume data not meant for it. It also meant that in order for `shell:start_interactive/0` to work on Windows an API that did not support reading of Unicode characters had to be used.

  Own Id: OTP-19313 Aux Id: [PR-8962], [GH-8113]

- The literals chunk in BEAM is no longer compressed, resulting in slightly smaller BEAM files when a BEAM file is stripped using `beam_lib:strip_files/1`.
  
  This is a potential incompatibility for tools that read and interpret the contents of the literal chunk. One way to update such tools to work with the new format is to retrieve the chunk using [`beam_lib:chunks(Beam, [literals])`](`beam_lib:chunks/2`).

  *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

  Own Id: OTP-19323 Aux Id: [GH-8967], [PR-8988]

- Fixed `erlang:localtime_to_universaltime/2` with `IsDST` set to `true` and a timezone without daylight saving (for example `UTC`) to assume that the provided localtime does not have DST. This has always been the behaviour, but glibc versions after 2.37 changed it so that the behavior in Erlang also changed.

  Own Id: OTP-19453 Aux Id: [PR-9207]

- Support for the `TZ` environment variable has been added on Windows. Before this change only the time zone configured in the OS was ever used.

  Own Id: OTP-19454 Aux Id: [PR-9207]

- Suppressed various warnings when building the emulator with recent versions of GCC

  Own Id: OTP-19488 Aux Id: [GH-9413], [PR-9417]

- Fixed a bug in re:run and re:compile where the pattern parameter would be read incorrectly if it was a sub-binary.

  Own Id: OTP-19507 Aux Id: [PR-9478], [GH-9438]

- Fixed a broken makefile rule that made it so that  `O2` and `-O2` could not be part of the directory path when building Erlang/OTP. Bug has been present since R11B released 2006.

  Own Id: OTP-19518 Aux Id: [PR-9488], [GH-9487]

- Fixed the index types of modules `atomics` and `counters` from `integer()` to `pos_integer()`, which is more correct.

  Own Id: OTP-19532 Aux Id: [PR-9538]

- Fix [`erl`](erl_cmd.md) flags `+Q`, `+P` and `+t` to not allow values greater than 4294975487. Before this fix, the runtime would either truncate the value or crash depending on which value was given.

  Own Id: OTP-19594 Aux Id: [PR-9671], [GH-9668]

- The socket option names for built-in socket options in the module `socket` has been cleaned up.
  
  Now, for known socket options, it is only the canonical protocol names that are allowed such as `ip` for the socket option `{ip,recvtos}`.  Previously, due to being a protocol alias; `{'IP',recvtos}` was also allowed, as was the incorrect `{hopopt,recvtos}` because the protocol `hopopt` on Linux has the same protocol number as `ip`.
  
  So, to reduce confusion, all enumerated protocol names with the same number, are not allowed for the known protocol options, only the canonical name.

  *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

  Own Id: OTP-19615 Aux Id: [PR-9718]

- On windows, socket:sendv could incorrectly return {ok, integer()} on Windows.

### Improvements and New Features

- Functionality making it possible for processes to enable reception of [priority messages](`e:system:ref_man_processes.md#priority-messages`) has been introduced in accordance with [EEP 76](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0076).

  Own Id: OTP-19198 Aux Id: [PR-9269], [PR-9519], [PR-9590]

- The `trace:system/3` function has been added. It has a similar interface as `erlang:system_monitor/2` but it also supports trace sessions.

  Own Id: OTP-19271 Aux Id: [PR-8660]

- Added support for `SIGWINCH`, `SIGCONT`, and `SIGINFO` signals to `os:set_signal/2` where available.

  Own Id: OTP-19278 Aux Id: [PR-8887], [PR-8938]

- The [`erl -noshell`](erl_cmd.md#noshell) mode has been updated to have two sub modes called `raw` and `cooked`, where `cooked` is the old default behaviour and `raw` can be used to bypass the line-editing support of the native terminal. Using `raw` mode it is possible to read keystrokes as they happen without the user having to press Enter. Also, the `raw` mode does not echo the typed characters to stdout. An example of how to create a tic-tac-toe game using this mechanism is included in [the documentation](`e:stdlib:terminal_interface.md`).

  Own Id: OTP-19314 Aux Id: [PR-8962], [GH-8037]

- [EEP-69: Nominal Types](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0069) has been implemented. As a side effect, nominal types can encode opaque types. We changed all opaque-handling logic and improved opaque warnings in Dialyzer.
  
  All existing Erlang type systems are structural: two types are seen as equivalent if their structures are the same. Type comparisons are based on the structures of the types, not on how the user explicitly defines them. For example, in the following example, `meter()` and `foot()` are equivalent. The two types can be used interchangeably. Neither of them differ from the basic type `integer()`.
  
  ````
  -type meter() :: integer().
  -type foot() :: integer().
  ````
  
  Nominal typing is an alternative type system, where two types are equivalent if and only if they are declared with the same type name. The EEP proposes one new syntax -nominal for declaring nominal types. Under nominal typing, `meter()` and `foot()` are no longer compatible. Whenever a function expects type `meter()`, passing in type `foot()` would result in a Dialyzer error.
  
  ````
  -nominal meter() :: integer().
  -nominal foot() :: integer().
  ````
  
  More nominal type-checking rules can be found in the EEP. It is worth noting that most work for adding nominal types and type-checking is in `erl_types.erl`. The rest are changes that removed the previous opaque type-checking, and added an improved version of it using nominal type-checking with reworked warnings.
  
  Backwards compatibility for opaque type-checking is not preserved by this PR. Previous opaque warnings can appear with slightly different wordings. A new kind of opaque warning `opaque_union` is added, together with a Dialyzer option `no_opaque_union` to turn this kind of warnings off.

  Own Id: OTP-19364 Aux Id: [PR-9079]

- Two BIFs have been added to the `m:erlang` module. 
  
  `erlang:processes_iterator/0` returns a process iterator that can be used to
  iterate through the process table.
  
  `erlang:process_next/1` takes in a process iterator and returns a 2-tuple, consisting of a process identifier and a new process iterator. When the process iterator runs out of processes in the process table, `none` will be returned.
  
  Using these BIFs to scan the processes scales better than using `erlang:processes/0`, at the cost of giving less consistency guarantees. Process identifiers returned from consecutive calls of `erlang:process_next/1` may not be a consistent snapshot of all elements existing in the table during any of the calls. A process identifier is only guaranteed to be returned from a call to `erlang:processes_next/1` if it was alive before the call to `erlang:processes_iterator/0` and was still alive when `erlang:processes_next/1` returned `none`.

  Own Id: OTP-19369 Aux Id: [PR-9129]

- Improved open debug for gen_tcp_socket (connect and listen) and gen_udp_socket (open).

  Own Id: OTP-19386

- Module `m:re` has been updated to use PCRE2, which is mostly backward compatible with PCRE.
  
  The most noticeable incompatibilities are
  * The default character encoding is pure ASCII and not Latin1. Unicode support
    is still available with options `unicode` and `ucp`.
  * Options `bsr_anycrlf`, `bsr_unicode` and `{newline,_}` are only set when a
    regex is compiled and cannot be changed at matching for precompiled regex.

  *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

  Own Id: OTP-19431 Aux Id: [PR-9299], [PR-9610]

- When booting the runtime system on a 32-bit computer with a single core, the boot code will try to minimize the peak memory use by disabling parallel loading of BEAM files.

  Own Id: OTP-19450 Aux Id: [PR-9342]

- A `socket` option `{otp,select_read}` has been added that enables keeping a socket in the VM select/poll set between calls to recv functions.
  
  This increases throughput by reducing the number of calls to said functions.

  Own Id: OTP-19451 Aux Id: [PR-9344]

- `erlc` will now write compiler warnings and errors to standard error, instead of standard output, in common with other language compilers.

  Own Id: OTP-19460 Aux Id: [GH-9255], [PR-9363]

- Fixed the Windows build to always include `.pdb` files for all DLLs and executables to help with debugging.

  Own Id: OTP-19465 Aux Id: [PR-9229]

- Improve the naming of the (internal) esock mutex(es). It is now possible to configure (as in autoconf) the use of simple names for the esock mutex(es).

  Own Id: OTP-19472 Aux Id: [PR-9388]

- An optimization for appending 0 bits to a binary was removed in patch releases for OTP versions 25, 26, and 27. This optimization has been reintroduced in Erlang/OTP 28.

  Own Id: OTP-19473 Aux Id: [PR-9396], [PR-8697]

- Fixed licenses in files and added ORT curations to the following apps: otp, eldap, erl_interface, eunit, parsetools, stdlib, syntax_tools, and ERTS.

  Own Id: OTP-19478 Aux Id: [PR-9376], [PR-9402], [PR-9819]

- When using [`enif_select_read`](erl_nif.md#enif_select_read) (or [`enif_select`](erl_nif.md#enif_select) with `ERL_NIF_SELECT_READ`) on systems with kernel polling enabled (that is most Unix systems), file descriptors that are always re-enabled as soon as they trigger are now part of a specialized pollset just as [`driver_select`](erl_driver.md#driver_select). This reduces the CPU usage in such scenarios as the erts does not have to re-insert the FD everytime it it triggered. As a result of this optimization `m:socket` based reading uses a lot less CPU and achieves a higher throughput.

  Own Id: OTP-19479 Aux Id: [PR-9275]

- Added support for compiling Erlang/OTP for Windows on ARM64.

  Own Id: OTP-19480 Aux Id: [PR-8734]

- The Windows installer no longer creates the `erl.ini` file, making installations redistributable.

  Own Id: OTP-19481 Aux Id: [PR-9330]

- Added erlang:hibernate/0, which hibernates a process without discarding the stack.

  Own Id: OTP-19503 Aux Id: [PR-9406]

- The asmjit library (used by BeamJIT) has been updated to version 029075b84bf0161a761beb63e6eda519a29020db.

  Own Id: OTP-19509 Aux Id: [PR-9495]

- When compiling C/C++ code on Unix systems, the compiler hardening flags suggested by the [Open Source Security Foundation](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/blob/main/docs/Compiler-Hardening-Guides/Compiler-Options-Hardening-Guide-for-C-and-C%2B%2B.md) are now enabled by default. To disable them, pass `--disable-security-hardening-flags` to `configure`.

  Own Id: OTP-19519 Aux Id: [PR-9441]

- If a process being suspended using [`erlang:suspend_process()`](`erlang:suspend_process/2`)
  currently is waiting in a `receive ... after` expression, the timer for the timeout will now also be
  suspended until the process is resumed.

  *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

  Own Id: OTP-19536 Aux Id: [PR-8670]

- A test module for TLS distribution over `socket` has been implemented.

  Own Id: OTP-19539 Aux Id: [PR-9511]

- Upgrade pcre2 to 10.45

  Own Id: OTP-19541 Aux Id: [PR-9582]

- The `+R` emulator options has been removed. It has had any effect since Erlang/OTP R9.

  Own Id: OTP-19551 Aux Id: [PR-9608]

- The license and copyright header has changed format to include an `SPDX-License-Identifier`. At the same time, most files have been updated to follow a uniform standard for license headers.

  Own Id: OTP-19575 Aux Id: [PR-9670]

- Increase the default inet-driver buffer size(s). Also introduce kernel parameters for UDP and SCTP to change the sizes when creating (those) sockets.

  Own Id: OTP-19576

- Add [`+JPperfdirectory <dir>`](erl_cmd.md#%2BJPperfdirectory) for specifying which directory Erlang should place perf symbol information files.

  Own Id: OTP-19589 Aux Id: [PR-9639], [GH-9500]

- Allow multiple static nifs to be part of the same archive. See the [NIF documentation](erl_nif.md#initialization) for details.

  Own Id: OTP-19590 Aux Id: [PR-9625]

- Various improvements reducing lock contention on run queues due to task stealing.

  Own Id: OTP-19591 Aux Id: [PR-9594]

- The new implementation has the same behavior as the previous one. The newer compilers already have native support for FP16, so this implementation is only relevant for older compilers. For this reason, the new implementation has not been tested for speed.

  Own Id: OTP-19603 Aux Id: [PR-9735]

- An  **experimental** API for a native debugger has been added. The main components are the following:
  
  * A new compiler option `beam_debug_info` for the Erlang compiler. When given, most optimizations are disabled and debug information suitable for the native debugger are added to generated BEAM files.
  
  * A new `+D` emulator flag. When given, the VM becomes "debuggable", which means that when modules that been compiled with the `beam_debug_info` option are loaded, the code is instrumented so that one can enable and disable breakpoints on executable lines.
  
  * An experimental `erl_debugger` module with a new debugging API. Essentially, it allows a single, local, process to be registered as the "debugger" process for the node. This process is the one that will receive messages notifying that a process hit a breakpoint. This way, the front-end implementation of a debugger (such as [edb from WhatApp](https://github.com/WhatsApp/edb)) can be decoupled from OTP.
  
  * The `erl_debugger` module also exposes new BIFs to inspect `X` and `Y` registers of a suspended process. Together with new code-information BIFs, this let's a debugger show the values of variables in scope for a suspended process.

  Own Id: OTP-19609 Aux Id: [PR-8670], [PR-9334], [PR-9604]

- Update internal `ryu` implementation to use latest version. The new version is a little bit faster in some scenarios. `ryu` is used by `float_to_list/1` and similar functions to convert floats to strings.

  Own Id: OTP-19613 Aux Id: [PR-9733]

- Update of MD5 implementation from OpenSSL version 3.1.4 to 3.5.

  Own Id: OTP-19614 Aux Id: [PR-9775]

- Small optimization in binary_to_term by not allocating an unnecessary large native stack frame.

- `gen_sctp:peeloff/2` has been fixed to inherit socket options to the peeled off socket more like `gen_tcp:accept/1`, for example the options `tos` or `tclass`.
  
  When setting SCTP options that are unsupported on the platform, some should be silently ignored, but a bug caused the option parsing to derail so the options after could bail out and cause an error instead.  This has been fixed.

## Erts 15.1.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- A bug has been fixed where receiving an SCTP message with `gen_sctp` could waste the first fragments of a message and only deliver the last fragment.
  
  This happened with low probability when the OS signaled that the socket was ready for reading in combination with an internal time-out retry.
  
  A bug has been fixed with a lingering time-out from after an SCTP connect that could stop the flow of incoming messages on an active `gen_tcp` socket.

  Own Id: OTP-19235 Aux Id: ERIERL-1133, [PR-8837]

- An boolean option `non_block_send` for SCTP, has ben added to be able to achieve the old behaviour to avoid blocking send operations by passing the OS network stack error message (`{error,eagain}` through.

  Own Id: OTP-19258 Aux Id: OTP-19061, ERIERL-1134

- The call `gen_tcp:send/2` could hang indefinitely despite having set the `send_timeout` option for the following unfortunate combination of circumstances:
  
  * The socket has to be in passive mode.
  * All output buffers had to be filled util the `high_watermark` was hit, causing the `gen_tcp:send/2` operation to block.
  * While the send operation was blocked, a `gen_tcp:recv/2,3` call had to be done from a different process.  It had to block, waiting for data for a while before completing the operation, and the received packet had to fill at least 75% of the receive buffer.
  
  Under these circumstances he information that a send operation was waiting got lost, so the send operation that blocked in the first placed would never return.  The data it had would be sent, though, and send operations from other processes, still work.
  
  This bug has been fixed.

- A boolean option `read_ahead` has been implemented for `gen_tcp`, default `true`, to facilitate not reading past (caching data) the end of a packet.  In particular, for kTLS, caching data could read in data that was supposed to be decrypted by the platform's network stack, before crypto parameters could be activated.

  Own Id: OTP-19199 Aux Id: OTP-19175, [GH-8561], [GH-8690], [GH-8785]

- The `m:zip` module has been updated with support for:
  
  * zip64 archives - Archives larger than 4GB or with more than 2^32 entries.
  * extended timestamps - Higher resolution and in UTC.
  * UID/GID - Save and extract the original UID/GID.
  * Fixes so that permission mode attributes are correctly read and set for files in archives.
  * `zip:list_dir/2` now also returns directories, not only files. (You can disable this behaviour by using the option `skip_directories`).
  
  Various bugs in the original implementation have also been fixed, such as:
  
  * Correctly encode and decode the DOS timestamps for entries within an archive (that is the non-extended timestamp).
  * Fix DOS timestamps to be set to localtime instead of UTC (use extended timestamps for UTC timestamps).
  * Use the unix file attributes read from disk when creating archives instead of setting everything to 644.

### Improvements and New Features

- Refactored how the JIT handles POSIX signals and how they affect thread stacks, allowing us to use the native stack register for Erlang stacks on more platforms.
  
  Notably, containers built on 64-bit x86 Alpine Linux images will now perform much better in sequential code. As an example, running `dialyzer` over the OTP code base finishes about 15% quicker.

  Own Id: OTP-18568 Aux Id: [PR-7174]

- The `m:instrument` module can now track allocations on a per-process or per-port basis.

  Own Id: OTP-18577 Aux Id: [PR-7236]

- The `pid` field returned from [`erlang:fun_info/1,2`](`erlang:fun_info/2`) is now always the pid for the `init` process of the local node, not the pid for the actual process that created the fun.

  *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

  Own Id: OTP-18594 Aux Id: [PR-7274]

- By default, escripts will now be compiled instead of interpreted. That means that the `compiler` application must be installed.

  *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

  Own Id: OTP-18639 Aux Id: [PR-7348]

- A binary returned from the `m:socket` receive functions is no longer created as a sub binary of an often large receive buffer binary (socket option `{otp,rcvbuf}`).  This avoids space waste, trusting the allocators to implement reallocation efficiently.

  Own Id: OTP-18642 Aux Id: [GH-6152], [PR-7465]

- The default process limit has been raised to `1048576` processes.

  Own Id: OTP-18699 Aux Id: [PR-7388]

- The `erlang:system_monitor/2` functionality is now able to monitor long message queues in the system.

  Own Id: OTP-18709 Aux Id: [PR-7651]

- The `erl` command now supports the `-S` flag, which is similar to the `-run` flag, except that it will pass all arguments up to end of the command line to the called function. (The `-run` flag will not pass arguments beginning with a hyphen.) Another difference is that `-S` will always call a function with one argument, passing an empty list if no arguments were given.

  Own Id: OTP-18744 Aux Id: [PR-7470]

- When implementing an alternative carrier for the Erlang distribution, a separate input handler process may now be registered, using `erlang:dist_ctrl_input_handler/2`, also in the case when the distribution controller is a port.

  Own Id: OTP-18774 Aux Id: [PR-7110]

- The call stack trace has now been added to the error reported by `erlang:process_flag/2` when `max_heap_size` limit has been exceeded.

  Own Id: OTP-18779 Aux Id: [PR-7592]

- `-callback` attributes have been added to `m:erl_tracer`.

  Own Id: OTP-18794 Aux Id: [PR-7703]

- For `inet_backend = socket`, setting the `active` socket option alone, to `once`, `true` or `N` has been optimized, as well as the corresponding data delivery.

  Own Id: OTP-18835

- New functions `socket:sendv/*` for sending I/O vectors have been added.

  Own Id: OTP-18845

- Socket options that take string now also accept binaries.

  Own Id: OTP-18849 Aux Id: [PR-6510]

- Native coverage support has been implemented in the JIT. It will  automatically be used by the `m:cover` tool to reduce the execution overhead when running cover-compiled code.
  
  There are also new APIs to support native coverage without using the `cover` tool.
  
  To instrument code for native coverage it must be compiled with the [`line_coverage`](`m:compile#line_coverage`) option.
  
  To enable native coverage in the runtime system, start it like so:
  
  ```text
  $ erl +JPcover true
  ```
  
  There are also the following new functions for supporting native coverage:
  
  * `code:coverage_support/0`
  * `code:get_coverage/2`
  * `code:reset_coverage/1`
  * `code:get_coverage_mode/0`
  * `code:get_coverage_mode/1`
  * `code:set_coverage_mode/1`

  Own Id: OTP-18856 Aux Id: [PR-7856]

- Changed the default value of the command line flag `-code_path_choice` to `strict`. 
  
  Note that for application systems using archives, it is necessary to add the `code_path_choice relaxed` to the command line that invokes `erl`.

  Own Id: OTP-18894 Aux Id: [PR-7243]

- Added module loading to `erl -init_debug` printouts.

  Own Id: OTP-18929 Aux Id: [PR-8004]

- When the runtime system halts, it performs various flush operations before terminating. By default there is no limit on how much time the flush operations are allowed to take. A new *halt flush timeout* functionality has been introduced which can be used for limiting the amount of time that the flushing operations are allowed to take. For more information see the documentation of the [`flush_timeout`](`m:erlang#halt_flush_timeout`) option of the [`erlang:halt/2`](`erlang:halt/2`) BIF and the documentation of the `erl` [`+zhft <Timeout>`](erl_cmd.md#+zhft) command line flag.

- The deprecated functions in `m:zlib` have been removed. That includes `inflateChunk/{1,2}`, `getBufSize/1`, `setBufSize/2`, the CRC32 functions, and the Adler checksum functions.

  Own Id: OTP-18950

- The documentation has been migrated to use Markdown and ExDoc.

  Own Id: OTP-18955 Aux Id: [PR-8026]

- Safe destructive update of tuples has been implemented in the compiler and runtime system. This allows the VM to update tuples in-place when it is safe to do so, thus improving performance by doing less copying but also by producing less garbage.
  
  Example:
  
  ```erlang
  -record(rec, {a,b,c}).
  
  update(#rec{a=needs_update,b=N}=R0) ->
      R = R0#rec{a=up_to_date},
      if
          N < 0 ->
              R#rec{c=negative};
          N == 0 ->
              R#rec{c=zero};
          N > 0 ->
              R#rec{c=positive}
      end.
  ```
  
  The record updates in each of the three clauses of the `if` can safely be done in-place, because variable `R` is not used again.

  Own Id: OTP-18972 Aux Id: [PR-8090]

- The obsolete and undocumented support for opening a port to an external
  resource by passing an atom (or a string) as first argument to
  [`open_port()`](`erlang:open_port/2`), implemented by the vanilla driver,
  has been removed. This feature has been scheduled for removal in OTP 27
  since the release of OTP 26.

  Own Id: OTP-18976 Aux Id: [PR-7125]

- An optional NIF callback `ERL_NIF_OPT_ON_UNLOAD_THREAD` to be called by all scheduler threads when a NIF library is unloaded. Used for releasing thread specific data. Can be set with function `enif_set_option`.

  Own Id: OTP-18977 Aux Id: [PR-7809]

- There is a new module `m:trace` in Kernel providing the same trace functionality as `erlang:trace/3` and `erlang:trace_pattern/3`, but with the addition of **dynamic isolated trace sessions**.

  Own Id: OTP-18980

- Added the `+MMlp on|off` emulator option to let the `mseg` allocator use "large pages" (sometimes known as "huge pages" or "super pages"). This currently only affects super-carrier allocations, but may be extended in the future.

  Own Id: OTP-18984 Aux Id: [PR-7977]

- `inet_backend = socket` has been optimized and reworked to be more compatible with the original `inet_backend = inet`.

  Own Id: OTP-19004 Aux Id: OTP-18835

- The `socket` documentation has been reworked, and due to
  that a few details were fixed:
  * `socket:is_supported/1` now returns `true` for example for `protocols`
    that is a "category", not an item.
  * `socket:cancel_monitor/1` no longer badargs for a monitor that was set by
    another process, instead it returns `false` as for other unknown
    `reference()`s.

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

* A bug has been fixed where receiving an SCTP message with \`gen_sctp\` could waste the first fragments of a message and only deliver the last fragment.

  This happened with low probability when the OS signaled that the socket was ready for reading in combination with an internal time-out retry.

  A bug has been fixed with a lingering time-out from after an SCTP connect that could stop the flow of incoming messages on an active \`gen_tcp\` socket.

  Own Id: OTP-19258 Aux Id: OTP-19061, ERIERL-1134
* The call \`gen_tcp:send/2\` could hang indefinitely despite having set the \`send_timeout\` option for the following unfortunate combination of circumstances:

  \* The socket has to be in passive mode. * All output buffers had to be filled util the \`high_watermark\` was hit, causing the \`gen_tcp:send/2\` operation to block. * While the send operation was blocked, a \`gen_tcp:recv/2,3\` call had to be done from a different process. It had to block, waiting for data for a while before completing the operation, and the received packet had to fill at least 75% of the receive buffer.

  Under these circumstances he information that a send operation was waiting got lost, so the send operation that blocked in the first placed would never return. The data it had would be sent, though, and send operations from other processes, still work.

  This bug has been fixed.

* When [*no time warp mode*](time_correction.md#no-time-warp-mode) was enabled, a smaller Erlang monotonic time could be read than a previously read time, i.e., breaking the monotonic property. The runtime system will abort when detecting an issue like this since OTP 24.3.4.17 and OTP 25.0.

  Up until OTP 25 *no time warp mode* is the default. As of OTP 26 [*multi time warp mode*](time_correction.md#multi-time-warp-mode) is the default.

### Improvements and New Features

* Checks for monotonicity of monotonic time have been improved so that Erlang and OS monotonic time are checked separately.

  A new `configure` argument `--enable-ensure-os-monotonic-time` has also been added. It enables functionality ensuring the monotonicity of monotonic timestamps delivered by the OS. When a non-monotonic timestamp is detected, it will be replaced by the last delivered monotonic timestamp before being used by Erlang's time functionality. Note that you do *not* want to enable this unless the OS monotonic time source on the system fails to produce monotonic timestamps. This since ensuring the monotonicity of OS monotonic timestamps will hurt scalability and performance of the system.

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

* 32-bit runtime systems on most Unix like platforms could crash if a BIF timer was set with a huge timeout of more than 68 years into the future. In order for the crash to occur, the huge timer (at a later time than when it was set) had to become the nearest active timer set on the specific scheduler on which it was set. This could not happen on a system with only one scheduler since there would always be shorter timers in the system.

  Setting a timer larger than 49 days on Windows could under rare circumstances cause the timeout to be delayed.

  inspected using the break menu (CTRL-C). When it ended up in this inconsistent
  state, it was not enqueued into a run queue even though it was set in a
  runnable state.This also effected signals being sent to the process after it
  had gotten into this inconsistent state, in such a way that it was from this
  point not possible to communicate with it.

- A race occurring when a process was selected for dirty execution
  simultaneously as it was scheduled for handling a signal could cause the
  process to end up in an inconsistent state. When it ended up in this
  inconsistent state, it was not enqueued into a run queue even though it was
  set in a runnable state. This also effected signals being sent to the process
  after it had gotten into this inconsistent state, in such a way that it was
  from this point not possible to communicate with it.

  Own Id: OTP-18839 Aux Id: PR-7822, GH-7801

- When a process had to to wait in the run queue for a long time before being
  selected for dirty execution, it could not receive signals. This caused
  inspection of such a process, for example using
  [`process_info/2`](`process_info/2`), to take a long time.

  This issue was introduced in OTP 25.3.2.6 and 26.1 when fixing an issue where
  a constant flow of signals prevented a process from being able to execute
  dirty.

- On OTP 24 and OTP 25, incoming distributed messages larger than 64 KiB sent
  using an alias leaked memory if the alias had been removed prior to entering
  the node. This issue was not present on OTP 26.

  Incoming distributed messages larger than 64 KiB sent using an alias which had
  been removed on the receiving node could crash the node. This crash was quite
  unlikely on OTP 24 and OTP 25, but very likely on OTP 26.

  `'DOWN'` signals with exit reason larger than 64 KiB directed towards a
  process on a node with a not matching creation leaked memory on the receiving
  node. Such signals should however be very rare.

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- If the external term format encoding of an argument list part of a distributed
  spawn operation was faulty, the newly spawned remote process could misbehave.
  The misbehavior included hanging or interpret an incoming message as an
  argument list to use. This was very unlikely to happen unless using an
  alternate implementation of the distribution protocol which made a faulty
  encoding of the argument list. The child process will now detect this error
  and terminate before executing the user specified code.

  [`process_info(self(), message_queue_len)`](`process_info/2`) or
  [`process_info(self(), messages)`](`process_info/2`) and avoiding to execute a
  `receive` expression matching on messages could be very slow in detecting new
  messages. Note that you are still discouraged from using `process_info()` this
  way. A process that wants to check if there are messages available to handle
  should execute a `receive` expression matching on messages.

  Own Id: OTP-17771 Aux Id: GH-5325, PR-6370

- The TTY/terminal subsystem has been rewritten by moving more code to Erlang
  from the old linked-in driver and implementing all the I/O primitives needed
  in a NIF instead.

  On Unix platforms the user should not notice a lot of difference, besides
  better handling of unicode characters and fixing of some long standing bugs.

  Windows users will notice that erl.exe has the same functionality as a normal
  Unix shell and that werl.exe has been removed and replaced with a symlink to
  erl.exe. This makes the Windows Erlang terminal experience identical to that
  of Unix.

  The re-write brings with it a number of bug fixes and feature additions:

  - The TTY is now reset when Erlang exits, fixing zsh to not break when
    terminating an Erlang session.
  - `standard_error` now uses the same unicode mode as `standard_io`.
  - Hitting backspace when searching the shell history with an empty search
    string no longer breaks the shell.
  - Tab expansion now works on remote nodes started using the JCL interface.
  - It is now possible to configure the shell slogan and the session slogans
    (that is the texts that appear when you start an Erlang shell). See the
    kernel documentation for more details.
  - Added shell:start_interactive for starting the interactive shell from a
    non-interactive Erlang session (for example an escript).
  - On Windows, when starting in detached mode the standard handler are now set
    to `nul` devices instead of being unset.
  - Standard I/O now always defaults to `unicode` mode if supported. Previously
    the default was `latin1` if the runtime system had been started with
    `-oldshell` or `-noshell` (for example in an `escript`). To send raw bytes
    over standard out, one now explicitly has to specify
    `io:setopts(standard_io, [{encoding, latin1}]).`

  [multi time warp mode](time_correction.md#multi-time-warp-mode) is now enabled
  by default. This assumes that all code executing on the system is
  [time warp safe](time_correction.md#time-warp-safe-code).

  If you have old code in the system that is not time warp safe, you now
  explicitly need to start the system in
  [no time warp mode](time_correction.md#no-time-warp-mode) (or
  [singe time warp mode](time_correction.md#single-time-warp-mode) if it is
  partially time warp safe) in order to avoid problems. When starting the system
  in no time warp mode, the system behaves as it did prior to the introduction
  of the extended time functionality introduced in OTP 18.

  If you have code that is not time warp safe, you are strongly encouraged to
  change this so that you can use multi time warp mode. Compared to no time warp
  mode, multi time warp mode improves scalability and performance as well as
  accuracy and precision of time measurements.

    storage. The distribution flag
    [`DFLAG_V4_NC`](erl_dist_protocol.md#DFLAG_V4_NC) is therefor now also
    mandatory. OTP has since OTP 24 supported this. Also note that the external
    format produced by `term_to_binary()` and `term_to_iovec()` will
    unconditionally produce pids, ports, and references supporting this larger
    format.
  - the [new link protocol](erl_dist_protocol.md#new_link_protocol) introduced
    in OTP 23.3 is now mandatory. The distribution flag
    [`DFLAG_UNLINK_ID`](erl_dist_protocol.md#DFLAG_UNLINK_ID) is therefor now
    also mandatory.

    balancing may or may not be provided depending on underlying OS.

  - **[`reuseport_lb`](`m:inet#option-reuseport_lb`)** - Reuse of local port.
    Load balancing provided.

  - **[`exclusiveaddruse`](`m:inet#option-exclusiveaddruse`)** - Exclusive
    address/port usage on Windows. This socket option is Windows specific and
    will silently be ignored on other systems.

  The behavior of setting [`reuseaddr`](`m:inet#option-reuseaddr`) on Windows
  have changed in a _backwards incompatible_ way. The underlying `SO_REUSEADDR`
  socket option is now only set if both the `reusaddr` and the `reuseport`
  `inet` options have been set. This since the underlying `SO_REUSEADDR` socket
  option on Windows behaves similar to how BSD behaves if both the underlying
  socket options `SO_REUSEADDR` and `SO_REUSEPORT` have been set. See the
  documentation of the `reuseaddr` option for more information.

  Erlang VM.

  For applications where order is important, there is a new function
  `maps:iterator/2` for creating iterators that return the map elements in a

### Improvements and New Features

* Checks for monotonicity of monotonic time have been improved so that Erlang and OS monotonic time are checked separately.

  A new `configure` argument `--enable-ensure-os-monotonic-time` has also been added. It enables functionality ensuring the monotonicity of monotonic timestamps delivered by the OS. When a non-monotonic timestamp is detected, it will be replaced by the last delivered monotonic timestamp before being used by Erlang's time functionality. Note that you do *not* want to enable this unless the OS monotonic time source on the system fails to produce monotonic timestamps. This since ensuring the monotonicity of OS monotonic timestamps will hurt scalability and performance of the system.

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

* 32-bit runtime systems on most Unix like platforms could crash if a BIF timer was set with a huge timeout of more than 68 years into the future. In order for the crash to occur, the huge timer (at a later time than when it was set) had to become the nearest active timer set on the specific scheduler on which it was set. This could not happen on a system with only one scheduler since there would always be shorter timers in the system.

  Setting a timer larger than 49 days on Windows could under rare circumstances cause the timeout to be delayed.

  an inconsistent state when being `receive` traced, inspected using
  [`process_info/2`](`process_info/2`) with the `message_queue_len` item, or
  inspected using the break menu (CTRL-C). When it ended up in this inconsistent
  state, it was not enqueued into a run queue even though it was set in a
  runnable state.This also effected signals being sent to the process after it
  had gotten into this inconsistent state, in such a way that it was from this
  point not possible to communicate with it.

  [`process_info(self(), messages)`](`process_info/2`) and avoiding to execute a
  `receive` expression matching on messages could be very slow in detecting new
  messages. Note that you are still discouraged from using `process_info()` this
  way. A process that wants to check if there are messages available to handle
  should execute a `receive` expression matching on messages.

- If a runtime system which was starting the distribution already had existing
  pids, ports, or references referring to a node with the same nodename/creation

  ports, or references would not work as expected in various situations after
  the node had gone alive. This could only occur if the runtime system was
  communicated such pids, ports, or references prior to the distribution was
  started. That is, it was extremely unlikely to happen unless the distribution
  was started dynamically and was even then very unlikely to happen. The runtime
  system now checks for already existing pids, ports, and references with the
  same nodename/creation pair that it is about to use. If such are found another
  creation will be chosen in order to avoid these issues.

  Own Id: OTP-18328 Aux Id: GH-6439, PR-6440

- Fix bug in `binary_to_term` (and distributed receive) when decoding a large
  map (>32 keys) with unsorted small maps (<= 32) as keys of the large map.

  This was only a problem if the term was encoded by `erl_interface`,
  `jinterface` or otherwise, as the VM itself always encodes small maps with
  sorted keys.

  The "binary_to_term" would appear as successful but the created large map was
  internally inconsistent. The smaller key-maps could not be found with maps:get
  and friends. Other operations such as map compare and merge could probably
  also give incorrect results.

    not yet established (pending) connection
  - or a fun with a binary/bitstring, in its environment, referring to an
    off-heap binary (larger than 64 bytes).

  The symptom could be failed decoding on the receiving side leading to aborted
  connection. Fix OTP-18093 is a workaround for theses bugs that makes the VM

## Erts 13.0.3

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Distributed exit signals could be lost under the following conditions:

  - An exit signal from a parent process to a child process was lost if:

    - the parent process terminated before the spawn request that created the
      child had completed,
    - the spawn request set up a link between parent and child
    - the spawn request was distributed, and
    - the exit reason was larger than one machine word.

  - Loss of a connection over which a not yet completed spawn request was
    ongoing could cause loss of exit signals. Such loss of exit signals was very
    rare. Besides the above described connection loss also the following
    conditions had to be satisfied:

    - The spawn request that was interrupted by the connection loss also had to
      set up a link between the parent process and the child process.
    - The parent process that issued the spawn request also had to be
      terminating while the spawn request was interrupted by the connection
      loss.
    - The same parent process also had to have made other spawn requests to
      other nodes than to the node to which the connection was lost.
    - These spawn requests to the other nodes also had to set up links.
    - These spawn requests to the other nodes also had to be not yet completed
      at the time of the connection loss. That is, the spawn reply from the
      child process had not yet reached the parent process.

    If all the conditions above were met, exit signals to the children spawned
    due to the above described spawn requests to other nodes _could_ be lost.

    The above bug also caused a significant memory leak when it was triggered
    since the destruction of the parent process never completed.

  Own Id: OTP-18175 Aux Id: PR-6142

- An unlink operation made by a process that terminated before the unlink
  operation completed, i.e., before it had received an unlink-ack signal from
  the linked process, caused an exit signal to erroneously be sent from the
  terminating process to the process being unlinked. This exit signal would most
  often be ignored by the receiver, but if the receiver of the exit signal
  concurrently set up a new link, it could receive the exit signal with the
  actual exit reason of the terminating process instead of a `noproc` exit
  reason. It is however very hard to detect that this has happened and has no
  obvious negative consequences, so it should be considered harmless.

  A distributed unlink-ack signal received by a terminating process was also not
  properly removed which could cause a minor memory leak.

## Erts 13.0.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- A `spawn_reply` signal from a remote node could be delayed and be delivered
  after other signals from the newly spawned process.

  When this bug triggered, the connection to the node where the process was
  spawned sometimes could be taken down due to the bug. The following error
  message would then be logged if this happened:
  `Missing 'spawn_reply' signal from the node <RemoteNode> detected by <Pid> on the node <LocalNode>. The node <RemoteNode> probably suffers from the bug with ticket id OTP-17737.`

  This bug only affected processes which had enabled
  [`off_heap` `message_queue_data`](`m:erlang#process_flag_message_queue_data`)
  and parallel reception of signals had been automatically enabled.

  This bug was introduced in OTP 25.0, ERTS version 13.0.

### Improvements and New Features

- Users can now configure ETS tables with the `{write_concurrency, auto}`
  option. This option forces tables to automatically change the number of locks
  that are used at run-time depending on how much concurrency is detected. The

  `{write_concurrency, auto}` is active.

  Own Id: OTP-16852 Aux Id: ERL-1347, PR-5195

- The signal queue of a process with message_queue_data=off_heap\* has been
  optimized to allow parallel reception of signals from multiple processes.

  This is possible to do as Erlang only guarantees that signals (i.e., message
  signals and non-message signals) sent from a single process to another process
  are ordered in send order. However, there are no ordering guarantees for
  signals sent from different processes to a particular process. Therefore,
  several processes can send signals in parallel to a specific process without
  synchronizing with each other. However, such signal sending was previously
  always serialized as the senders had to acquire the lock for the outer signal
  queue of the receiving process. This parallel signal sending optimization
  yields much better scalability for signal sending than what was previously
  possible, see https://erlang.org/bench/sigq_bench_result.html for benchmark
  results.

  \* Information about how to enable the message_queue_data=off_heap setting can
  be found in the documentation of the function erlang:process_flag/2.

* Fixed a more or less harmless bug that caused time correction of Erlang monotonic time to become slightly off on Windows platforms when `QueryPerformanceCounter()` was used as OS monotonic time source.

  `erlang:system_info(os_monotonic_time_source)` now also returns information about *used resolution* which not always corresponds to the resolution of the OS monotonic time source.

  Own Id: OTP-19048 Aux Id: PR-8343

### Improvements and New Features

* Checks for monotonicity of monotonic time have been improved so that Erlang and OS monotonic time are checked separately.

  A new `configure` argument `--enable-ensure-os-monotonic-time` has also been added. It enables functionality ensuring the monotonicity of monotonic timestamps delivered by the OS. When a non-monotonic timestamp is detected, it will be replaced by the last delivered monotonic timestamp before being used by Erlang's time functionality. Note that you do *not* want to enable this unless the OS monotonic time source on the system fails to produce monotonic timestamps. This since ensuring the monotonicity of OS monotonic timestamps will hurt scalability and performance of the system.

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

* 32-bit runtime systems on most Unix like platforms could crash if a BIF timer was set with a huge timeout of more than 68 years into the future. In order for the crash to occur, the huge timer (at a later time than when it was set) had to become the nearest active timer set on the specific scheduler on which it was set. This could not happen on a system with only one scheduler since there would always be shorter timers in the system.

  Setting a timer larger than 49 days on Windows could under rare circumstances cause the timeout to be delayed.

- If a runtime system which was starting the distribution already had existing
  pids, ports, or references referring to a node with the same nodename/creation
  pair that the runtime system was about to use, these already existing pids,
  ports, or references would not work as expected in various situations after
  the node had gone alive. This could only occur if the runtime system was
  communicated such pids, ports, or references prior to the distribution was
  started. That is, it was extremely unlikely to happen unless the distribution
  was started dynamically and was even then very unlikely to happen. The runtime
  system now checks for already existing pids, ports, and references with the
  same nodename/creation pair that it is about to use. If such are found another
  creation will be chosen in order to avoid these issues.

- Fix bug in `binary_to_term` (and distributed receive) when decoding a large
  map (>32 keys) with unsorted small maps (<= 32) as keys of the large map.

  This was only a problem if the term was encoded by `erl_interface`,
  `jinterface` or otherwise, as the VM itself always encodes small maps with
  sorted keys.

  The "binary_to_term" would appear as successful but the created large map was
  internally inconsistent. The smaller key-maps could not be found with maps:get
  and friends. Other operations such as map compare and merge could probably
  also give incorrect results.

- Distributed exit signals could be lost under the following conditions:

  - An exit signal from a parent process to a child process was lost if:

    - the parent process terminated before the spawn request that created the
      child had completed,
    - the spawn request set up a link between parent and child
    - the spawn request was distributed, and
    - the exit reason was larger than one machine word.

  - Loss of a connection over which a not yet completed spawn request was
    ongoing could cause loss of exit signals. Such loss of exit signals was very
    rare. Besides the above described connection loss also the following
    conditions had to be satisfied:

    - The spawn request that was interrupted by the connection loss also had to
      set up a link between the parent process and the child process.
    - The parent process that issued the spawn request also had to be
      terminating while the spawn request was interrupted by the connection
      loss.
    - The same parent process also had to have made other spawn requests to
      other nodes than to the node to which the connection was lost.
    - These spawn requests to the other nodes also had to set up links.
    - These spawn requests to the other nodes also had to be not yet completed
      at the time of the connection loss. That is, the spawn reply from the
      child process had not yet reached the parent process.

    If all the conditions above were met, exit signals to the children spawned
    due to the above described spawn requests to other nodes _could_ be lost.

    The above bug also caused a significant memory leak when it was triggered
    since the destruction of the parent process never completed.

- An unlink operation made by a process that terminated before the unlink
  operation completed, i.e., before it had received an unlink-ack signal from
  the linked process, caused an exit signal to erroneously be sent from the
  terminating process to the process being unlinked. This exit signal would most
  often be ignored by the receiver, but if the receiver of the exit signal
  concurrently set up a new link, it could receive the exit signal with the
  actual exit reason of the terminating process instead of a `noproc` exit
  reason. It is however very hard to detect that this has happened and has no
  obvious negative consequences, so it should be considered harmless.

  A distributed unlink-ack signal received by a terminating process was also not
  properly removed which could cause a minor memory leak.

- By default `global` does _not_ take any actions to restore a fully connected
  network when connections are lost due to network issues. This is problematic
  for all applications expecting a fully connected network to be provided, such
  as for example `mnesia`, but also for `global` itself. A network of
  overlapping partitions might cause the internal state of `global` to become
  inconsistent. Such an inconsistency can remain even after such partitions have
  been brought together to form a fully connected network again. The effect on
  other applications that expects that a fully connected network is maintained
  may vary, but they might misbehave in very subtle hard to detect ways during
  such a partitioning.

  In order to prevent such issues, we have introduced a _prevent overlapping
  partitions_ fix which can be enabled using the
  [`prevent_overlapping_partitions`](`e:kernel:kernel_app.md#prevent_overlapping_partitions`)
  `kernel(6)` parameter. When this fix has been enabled, `global` will actively
  disconnect from nodes that reports that they have lost connections to other
  nodes. This will cause fully connected partitions to form instead of leaving
  the network in a state with overlapping partitions. Note that this fix _has_
  to be enabled on _all_ nodes in the network in order to work properly. Since
  this quite substantially changes the behavior, this fix is currently disabled
  by default. Since you might get hard to detect issues without this fix you
  are, however, _strongly_ advised to enable this fix in order to avoid issues
  such as the ones described above. As of OTP 25 this fix will become enabled by
  default.

- Responsiveness of processes executing on `normal` or `low` priority could
  suffer due to code purging or literal area removal on systems with a huge
  amount of processes. This since during these operations all processes on the
  system were scheduled for execution at once.

  This problem has been fixed by introducing a limit on outstanding purge and
  copy literal requests in the system. By default this limit is set to twice the
  amount of schedulers on the system. This will ensure that schedulers will have
  enough work scheduled to perform these operations as quickly as possible at
  the same time as other work will be interleaved to a much higher degree.
  Performance of these operations will however be somewhat degraded due to the
  overhead of enforcing this limit compared to when using a very large limit.

  This limit can be set by passing the `+zosrl` command line argument to `erl`,
  or by calling
  `erlang:system_flag(outstanding_system_requests_limit, NewLimit)`.

- The fix for Linux's behaviour when reconnecting an UDP socket in PR-5120
  released in OTP-24.1.2 has been refined to only dissolve the socket's
  connection before a connect if the socket is already connected, that is: only
  for a reconnect.

  This allows code to open a socket with an ephemeral port, get the port number
  and connect; without the port number changing (on Linux). This turned out to
  have at least one valid use case (besides test cases).

  Should one reconnect the socket then the port number may change, on Linux; it
  is a known quirk, which can be worked around by binding to a specific port
  number when opening the socket. If you can do without an ephemeral port, that
  is...

- The following two bugs that caused `erlang:demonitor()` to behave erroneously
  have been fixed. The bugs were only triggered if the monitor that was removed
  by `demonitor()` had previously been created simultaneously as a monitor and
  as an alias.

  - A demonitor operation on a monitor created using the
    `{alias, reply_demonitor}` option erroneously behaved as if the
    `{alias, explicit_unalias}` option had been used.
  - A demonitor operation did not prevent a corresponding `'DOWN'` message from
    being delivered if the monitor reference was kept as an active alias after
    the operation. This could only occur if the monitored process simultaneously
    terminated before the demonitor signal reached it, and the exit reason was
    not an immediate term. That is, a term larger than one machine word.

  Large parts of the `configure` script of `crypto` have been rewritten with
  various improvements and bug fixes. It is now better at finding usable OpenSSL

  as outlined by
  [EEP 53](https://github.com/erlang/eep/blob/master/eeps/eep-0053.md) has been
  introduced. It is introduced in order to provide a lightweight mechanism that
  can prevent late replies after timeout or connection loss. For more
  information, see EEP 53 and the documentation of the new
  [`alias/1`](`erlang:alias/1`) BIF and the new options to the
  [`monitor/3`](`erlang:monitor/3`) BIF.

  The `call` operation in the framework used by `gen_server`, `gen_statem`, and
  `gen_event` has been updated to utilize alias in order to prevent late
  responses. The `gen_statem` behavior still use a proxy process in the
  distributed case, since it has always prevented late replies and aliases won't
  work against pre OTP 24 nodes. The proxy process can be removed in OTP 26.

  The alias feature also made it possible to introduce new functions similar to
  the [`erpc:receive_response()`](`erpc:receive_response/2`) function in the gen
  behaviors, so the new functions
  [`gen_server:receive_response()`](`gen_server:receive_response/2`),
  [`gen_statem:receive_response()`](`gen_statem:receive_response/2`),
  [`gen_event:receive_response()`](`gen_event:receive_response/2`) have also

- By default all ERTS internal memory allocators based on `alloc_util` will now
  use their own separate carrier pool for migration of carriers instead of using
  a node global carrier pool. This was the default behavior between OTP 17 and
  OTP 21, but changed to use a node global carrier pool as of OTP 22.0. Usage of
  the node global carrier pool proved troublesome since it had a tendency to
  spread long lived blocks into allocators with normally short lived blocks
  causing increased memory fragmentation. The node global carrier pool behavior
  as well as other behaviors can be configured using the
  [`+M<S>cp`](erts_alloc.md#M_cp) command line argument.

- New functions have been added to the `maps` module: `merge_with/3`,
  `intersect/2`, `intersect_with/3`, `filtermap/2`, `from_keys/2`, and
  `maps:foreach/2`.

  `maps:merge_with/3` is the same as `merge/2` but takes an extra fun that is
  used to combine items with the same key.

  `maps:intersect/2` computes the intersection of two maps.

  `maps:intersect_with/3` is the same as `intersect/2` but takes an extra fun
  that is used to combine intersecting items.

  `maps:filtermap/2` allows filtering and mapping of a map in a single pass.

  `maps:from_keys/2` constructs a map from a list of keys and a single value and
  can be used to optimize sets operations such as from_list/1, filter/2,
  intersection/2, and subtract/2.

  `maps:foreach/2` allows iteration over a map without returning any value.

  communicated such pids, ports, or references prior to the distribution was
  started. That is, it was extremely unlikely to happen unless the distribution
  was started dynamically and was even then very unlikely to happen. The runtime
  system now checks for already existing pids, ports, and references with the

## Erts 11.2.2.16

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Distributed exit signals could be lost under the following conditions:

  - An exit signal from a parent process to a child process was lost if:

    - the parent process terminated before the spawn request that created the
      child had completed,
    - the spawn request set up a link between parent and child
    - the spawn request was distributed, and
    - the exit reason was larger than one machine word.

  - Loss of a connection over which a not yet completed spawn request was
    ongoing could cause loss of exit signals. Such loss of exit signals was very
    rare. Besides the above described connection loss also the following
    conditions had to be satisfied:

    - The spawn request that was interrupted by the connection loss also had to
      set up a link between the parent process and the child process.
    - The parent process that issued the spawn request also had to be
      terminating while the spawn request was interrupted by the connection
      loss.
    - The same parent process also had to have made other spawn requests to
      other nodes than to the node to which the connection was lost.
    - These spawn requests to the other nodes also had to set up links.
    - These spawn requests to the other nodes also had to be not yet completed
      at the time of the connection loss. That is, the spawn reply from the
      child process had not yet reached the parent process.

    If all the conditions above were met, exit signals to the children spawned
    due to the above described spawn requests to other nodes _could_ be lost.

    The above bug also caused a significant memory leak when it was triggered
    since the destruction of the parent process never completed.

- An unlink operation made by a process that terminated before the unlink
  operation completed, i.e., before it had received an unlink-ack signal from
  the linked process, caused an exit signal to erroneously be sent from the
  terminating process to the process being unlinked. This exit signal would most
  often be ignored by the receiver, but if the receiver of the exit signal
  concurrently set up a new link, it could receive the exit signal with the
  actual exit reason of the terminating process instead of a `noproc` exit
  reason. It is however very hard to detect that this has happened and has no
  obvious negative consequences, so it should be considered harmless.

  A distributed unlink-ack signal received by a terminating process was also not
  properly removed which could cause a minor memory leak.

## Erts 11.2.2.11

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- By default `global` does _not_ take any actions to restore a fully connected
  network when connections are lost due to network issues. This is problematic
  for all applications expecting a fully connected network to be provided, such
  as for example `mnesia`, but also for `global` itself. A network of
  overlapping partitions might cause the internal state of `global` to become
  inconsistent. Such an inconsistency can remain even after such partitions have
  been brought together to form a fully connected network again. The effect on
  other applications that expects that a fully connected network is maintained
  may vary, but they might misbehave in very subtle hard to detect ways during
  such a partitioning.

  In order to prevent such issues, we have introduced a _prevent overlapping
  partitions_ fix which can be enabled using the
  [`prevent_overlapping_partitions`](`e:kernel:kernel_app.md#prevent_overlapping_partitions`)
  `kernel(6)` parameter. When this fix has been enabled, `global` will actively
  disconnect from nodes that reports that they have lost connections to other
  nodes. This will cause fully connected partitions to form instead of leaving
  the network in a state with overlapping partitions. Note that this fix _has_
  to be enabled on _all_ nodes in the network in order to work properly. Since
  this quite substantially changes the behavior, this fix is currently disabled
  by default. Since you might get hard to detect issues without this fix you
  are, however, _strongly_ advised to enable this fix in order to avoid issues
  such as the ones described above. As of OTP 25 this fix will become enabled by
  default.

### Improvements and New Features

- Responsiveness of processes executing on `normal` or `low` priority could
  suffer due to code purging or literal area removal on systems with a huge
  amount of processes. This since during these operations all processes on the
  system were scheduled for execution at once.

  This problem has been fixed by introducing a limit on outstanding purge and
  copy literal requests in the system. By default this limit is set to twice the
  amount of schedulers on the system. This will ensure that schedulers will have
  enough work scheduled to perform these operations as quickly as possible at
  the same time as other work will be interleaved to a much higher degree.
  Performance of these operations will however be somewhat degraded due to the
  overhead of enforcing this limit compared to when using a very large limit.

  This limit can be set by passing the `+zosrl` command line argument to `erl`,
  or by calling
  `erlang:system_flag(outstanding_system_requests_limit, NewLimit)`.

- A [new link protocol](erl_dist_protocol.md#new_link_protocol) has been
  introduced which prevents links from ending up in an inconsistent state where
  one participant considers itself linked while the other doesn't. This bug has
  always existed in the distributed case, but has since OTP 21 also existed in
  the node local case since the distributed link protocol then was adopted also
  for node local links. The bug could, however, only trigger if both
  participants operated on the link simultaneously.

  Own Id: OTP-17229

- Fixed a bug in the timer implementation which could cause timers that were set
  to more than 37.25 hours in the future to be delayed. This could occur if
  there were multiple timers scheduled to be triggered very close in time, but
  still at different times, and the scheduler thread handling the timers was not
  able to handle them quickly enough. Delayed timers were in this case triggered
  when another unrelated timer was triggered.

## Erts 11.1.8

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixed a bug that could cause some work scheduled for execution on scheduler
  threads to be delayed until other similar work appeared. Beside delaying
  various cleanup of internal data structures also the following could be
  delayed:

  - Termination of a distribution controller process
  - Disabling of the distribution on a node
  - Gathering of memory allocator information using the `instrument` module
  - Enabling, disabling, and gathering of `msacc` information
  - Delivery of `'CHANGE'` messages when time offset is monitored
  - A call to `erlang:cancel_timer()`
  - A call to `erlang:read_timer()`
  - A call to `erlang:statistics(io | garbage_collection | scheduler_wall_time)`
  - A call to `ets:all()`
  - A call to `erlang:memory()`
  - A call to `erlang:system_info({allocator | allocator_sizes, _})`
  - A call to `erlang:trace_delivered()`

  The bug existed on runtime systems running on all types of hardware except for
  x86/x86_64.

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixed bugs causing issues when enabling the ERTS internal allocators on a
  system built with the undocumented and unsupported `SMALL_MEMORY` feature.

  Own Id: OTP-16939

- The inet driver used to use 16 as maximum elements in an I/O vector passed to
  `writev()` (and `WSASend()` on Windows). When the data to send contained lots
  of elements, this caused a performance degradation since repeated calls to
  `writev()` had to be made to a much larger extent. The inet driver now looks
  up actual maximum amount of elements that can be used on the system, instead
  of just assuming 16. On most systems this will result in a maximum amount of
  I/O vector elements of 1024.

  As of OTP 23.0 the term encoding of signals to send over the distribution are
  encoded into I/O vectors of buffers instead of into a single buffer. Reference
  counted binaries are referred to directly from the I/O vector instead of being
  copied into the single buffer. That is, Erlang signals containing huge amounts
  of reference counted binaries was effected by this performance degradation.

  Own Id: OTP-16955 Aux Id: ERL-1343, OTP-15618

- In the distributed case, a faulty `reply` option in a call to the
  `spawn_request()` BIF erroneously caused a `badarg` exception instead of a
  `badopt` error message reply.

## Erts 11.1.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- inet:setopts(\[\{active,once\}]) wakes up IO polling thread unnecessarily,
  leading to lock contention and visibly higher CPU utilization.

  Own Id: OTP-16847 Aux Id: ERL-1301

- Two bugs in the ERTS internal thread wakeup functionality have been fixed.
  These bugs mainly hit when all threads in the system tried to go to sleep.
  When the bugs were triggered, certain operations were delayed until a thread
  woke up due to some other reason. Most important operations effected were code
  loading, persistent term updates, and memory deallocation.

  Own Id: OTP-16870

- Fixed bug in `ets:select_replace/2` on `compressed` tables that could produce
  faulty results or VM crash. Bug exists since OTP 20.

  Own Id: OTP-16874 Aux Id: ERL-1356, PR-2763

- When compiling Erlang/OTP on macOS using Xcode 12, the performance of the BEAM
  interpreter would be degraded.

  Own Id: OTP-16892

### Improvements and New Features

- As of OTP 22, the allocator specific memory carrier pools were replaced by a
  node global carrier pool. This unfortunately caused substantial memory
  fragmentation in some cases due to long lived data being spread into carriers
  used by allocators mainly handling short lived data.

  A new command line argument `+M<S>cp` has been introduced with which one can
  enable the old behavior as well as configuring other behaviors for the carrier
  pools. In order to configure the old behavior, with allocator specific carrier
  pools for all allocators, pass `+Mucp :` (including the colon character) as a
  command line argument to `erl` when starting the Erlang system.

  The default configuration for carrier pools will be changed to `+Mucp :` some
  time in the future, but not in this patch.

- The emulator will no longer revert to the default number of schedulers when
  running under a CPU quota lower than 1 CPU.

  Own Id: OTP-16710 Aux Id: ERL-1280

- Fixed a problem with crash dumps. When a process that contained reference to
  literals internally created by the runtime system (such as the tuple returned
  by `os:type/0`), the literal would not be included in the crash dump and the
  crashdump viewer would complain about the heap being incomplete.

  Own Id: OTP-16713

- Fix configure detection of PGO for clang.

  Own Id: OTP-16738

- The to_erl program has been fixed to correctly interpret newline as only
  newline and not newline+return.

  This bug would cause the terminal to behave strangely when using lines longer
  than the terminal size.

  Own Id: OTP-16741

- A race condition when changing process priority by calling
  [`process_flag(priority, Prio)`](`process_flag/2`) could cause elevation of
  priority for a system task to be ignored. This bug hit if the system task was
  scheduled on the process calling `process_flag()` at the same time as the
  priority was changed. The bug is quite harmless and should hit very seldom if
  ever.

- Adjust `/bin/sh` to `/system/bin/sh` in scripts when installing on Android.

  Own Id: OTP-16833 Aux Id: PR-2729

- In rare circumstances, when loading a BEAM file generated by an alternative
  code generator (not the Erlang compiler in OTP) or from handwritten or patched
  BEAM code, the loader could do an unsafe optimization.

  Own Id: OTP-16850 Aux Id: ERL-1344

- A memory and file descriptor leak in socket has been fixed. (When a newly
  opened socket that had not entered the fd into the VM's poll set (neither
  received, sent, accepted nor connected) was abandoned without closing (process
  died), after assigning a different controlling process, then a memory block
  and the file descriptor could be leaked.)

  Own Id: OTP-16857

- The documentation of [`statistics(run_queue)`](`statistics/1`) erroneously
  stated that it returns the total length of all normal run queues when it is
  the total length of all normal and dirty CPU run queues that is returned. The

- An unintentional reuse of an already used emulator internal event object could
  cause a wakeup signal to a thread to be lost. In worst case this could cause
  the runtime system to hang. This hang was however quite rare.

  Own Id: OTP-16766 Aux Id: ERL-1304

- NIF threads and driver threads on non-Linux systems leaked internal resources
  when terminating. On Windows these resources were one event per thread. On
  most other systems one mutex and one condition variable per thread. On these
  other systems that also lacked `pthread_cond_timedwait()` also a pipe with its
  file descriptors was leaked.

## Erts 11.0.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- The functionality utilized by BIFs for temporary disabling of garbage
  collection while yielding could cause system task queues to become
  inconsistent on a process executing such a BIF. Process system tasks are for
  example utilized when purging code, garbage collecting literal data, and when
  issuing an ordinary garbage collection from another process.

  The bug does not trigger frequently. Multiple code purges in direct sequence
  makes it more likely that this bug is triggered. In the cases observed, this
  has resulted in a hanging code purge operation.

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- BIFs now behave like ordinary functions with regard to tracing, allowing
  `call_count` tracing and fixing a few bugs where return trace messages were
  lost when BIFs tail-called themselves or other functions ("trapping").

  Own Id: OTP-14734 Aux Id: ERL-496

- Fix various compiler warnings on 64-bit Windows.

  Own Id: OTP-15800

- `erlang:fun_info(fun foo/1, name/1)` used to return a function name based on

- `erlang:decode_packet` with type set to `httph` no longer accepts http headers
  that have whitespaces in between the header name and the colon. That is:

- Fix the quoting rules in `erl -args_file`, `ERL_FLAGS`, `ERL_AFLAGS` and
  `ERL_ZFLAGS` to work as unix sh quoting.

  This bug fix can make previous configuration options to `erl` passed through
  `ERL_FLAGS`, `ERL_AFLAGS`, `ERL_ZFLAGS` or `-args_file` not be interpreted in
  the same way as before the fix.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

- Fix the Erlang distribution to handle the scenario when a node connects that
  can handle message fragmentation but can not handle the atom cache. This bug
  only affects users that have implemented a custom distribution carrier. It has
  been present since OTP-21.

  The `DFLAG_FRAGMENT` distribution flag was added to the set of flags that can
  be rejected by a distribution implementation.

  Own Id: OTP-16284

- Compiling a match specification with excessive nesting caused the runtime
  system to crash due to scheduler stack exhaustion. Instead of crashing the
  runtime system, effected functions will now raise a `system_limit` error
  exception in this situation.

- Fix bug on Windows causing bad performance when standard input is closed,
  especially if the VM is only assigned one CPU core. Could be provoked for
  example by starting erl or escript via function `os:cmd/1`. Could be avoided
  with command line option `-noinput`.

  The bad performance was caused by an io thread spinning indefinitely.

### Improvements and New Features

- Improved concurrency of `erlang:load_nif/2` as it does no longer block other
  schedulers from executing during initial load of a NIF library.

  Own Id: OTP-10278

- EEP-52 has been implemented.

  In binary matching, the size of the segment to be matched is now allowed to be
  a guard expression, and similarly in map matching the keys can now be guard
  expressions. See the Erlang Reference Manual and Programming Examples for more
  details.

  Language compilers or code generators that generate Core Erlang code may need
  to be updated to be compatible with the compiler in OTP 23. For more details,
  see the section Backwards Compatibility in
  [EEP 52](http://erlang.org/eeps/eep-0052.html).

  Own Id: OTP-14708

- Internally in BEAM, handling of continuation pointers has been simplified.
  This change is not user-visible, except when examining a process stack in the
  crashdump viewer. The continuation pointer for a function will now be stored
  below the y(0) for that function.

  Own Id: OTP-15077

- `seq_trace` tokens are now propagated to spawned processes.

  Own Id: OTP-15232 Aux Id: ERL-700

  New functionality:

  - A distributed [`spawn_monitor()`](`erlang:spawn_monitor/4`) BIF.
  - Support for `monitor` option in the distributed
    [`spawn_opt()`](`erlang:spawn_opt/5`) BIF.
  - New [`spawn_request()`](`erlang:spawn_request/5`) BIFs for asynchronous
    spawn of processes. `spawn_request()` supports all options that
    `spawn_opt()` support plus a few more.

  Own Id: OTP-15251

- Make `ets:insert/2` and `ets:insert_new/2` yield scheduler execution on long
  lists of records to insert.

  Own Id: OTP-15517 Aux Id: ERL-560

- Increased size of node incarnation numbers (aka "creation"), from 2 bits to 32
  bits. This will reduce the risk of pids/ports/refs, from different node
  incarnation with the same name, being mixed up.

  Own Id: OTP-15603

- The runtime system can now encode Erlang terms to the Erlang external term
  format as I/O vectors. The main benefit of this is that reference counted
  binaries can be referred to directly instead of copied into a new binary.

  The default Erlang distribution over TCP will always utilize this. Alternate
  distribution implementations utilizing a port as distribution controller will
  utilize this if the driver implements the [`outputv`](driver_entry.md#outputv)
  callback. Alternate Erlang distribution implementations utilizing a process as
  distribution controller will utilize this if I/O vectors are utilized by the
  functionality that processes the data returned from
  [`erlang:dist_ctrl_get_data()`](`erlang:dist_ctrl_get_data/1`).

  The return type for data returned by
  [`erlang:dist_ctrl_get_data()`](`erlang:dist_ctrl_get_data/1`) has been
  changed from `t:iodata/0` to `iovec()`. Note that `iovec()` data is valid
  `t:iodata/0` so old implementations using `erlang:dist_ctrl_get_data()` do not
  need to be changed, but may benefit from being changed depending on usage
  scenario.

  The new BIFs [`term_to_iovec/1`](`erlang:term_to_iovec/1`) and
  [`term_to_iovec/2`](`erlang:term_to_iovec/2`) have been introduced. These work
  exactly as `term_to_binary()` with the corresponding arity except the return
  type.

  Own Id: OTP-15618

- Improved ETS scalability of concurrent calls that change the size of a table,
  like `ets:insert/2` and `ets:delete/2`.

  This performance feature was implemented for `ordered_set` in OTP 22.0 and
  does now apply for all ETS table types.

  The improved scalability may come at the cost of longer latency of
  `ets:info(T,size)` and `ets:info(T,memory)`. A new table option
  `decentralized_counters` has therefore been added. It is default `true` for
  `ordered_set` with `write_concurrency` enabled and default `false` for all
  other table types.

  - **\-dist_listen false** - Setup the distribution channel, but do not listen
    for incoming connection. This is useful when you want to use the current
    node to interact with another node on the same machine without it joining
    the entire cluster.

  - **\-erl_epmd_port Port** - Configure a default port that the built-in EPMD
    client should return. This allows the local node to know the port to connect
    to for any other node in the cluster.

  The `erl_epmd` callback API has also been extended to allow returning `-1` as
  the creation which means that a random creation will be created by the node.

  In addition a new callback function called `listen_port_please` has been added
  that allows the callback to return which listen port the distribution should
  use. This can be used instead of `inet_dist_listen_min/max` if the listen port
  is to be fetched from an external service.

- On systems without `closefrom()`, such as Linux, iterating over all possible
  file descriptors and calling `close()` for each is inefficient. This is
  markedly so when the maximum number of file descriptors has been tuned to a
  large number.

  Instead, in erl_child_setup, walk the open descriptors under `/dev/fd` and
  close only those which are open.

  This optimization affects the CPU usage of starting a new Erlang instance.

## Erts 10.7.2.17

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- By default `global` does _not_ take any actions to restore a fully connected
  network when connections are lost due to network issues. This is problematic
  for all applications expecting a fully connected network to be provided, such
  as for example `mnesia`, but also for `global` itself. A network of
  overlapping partitions might cause the internal state of `global` to become
  inconsistent. Such an inconsistency can remain even after such partitions have
  been brought together to form a fully connected network again. The effect on
  other applications that expects that a fully connected network is maintained
  may vary, but they might misbehave in very subtle hard to detect ways during
  such a partitioning.

  In order to prevent such issues, we have introduced a _prevent overlapping
  partitions_ fix which can be enabled using the
  `prevent_overlapping_partitions` `kernel(6)` parameter. When this fix has been
  enabled, `global` will actively disconnect from nodes that reports that they
  have lost connections to other nodes. This will cause fully connected
  partitions to form instead of leaving the network in a state with overlapping
  partitions. Note that this fix _has_ to be enabled on _all_ nodes in the
  network in order to work properly. Since this quite substantially changes the
  behavior, this fix is currently disabled by default. Since you might get hard
  to detect issues without this fix you are, however, _strongly_ advised to
  enable this fix in order to avoid issues such as the ones described above. As
  of OTP 25 this fix will become enabled by default.

## Erts 10.7.2.16

### Improvements and New Features

- Responsiveness of processes executing on `normal` or `low` priority could
  suffer due to code purging or literal area removal on systems with a huge
  amount of processes. This since during these operations all processes on the
  system were scheduled for execution at once.

  This problem has been fixed by introducing a limit on outstanding purge and
  copy literal requests in the system. By default this limit is set to twice the
  amount of schedulers on the system. This will ensure that schedulers will have
  enough work scheduled to perform these operations as quickly as possible at
  the same time as other work will be interleaved to a much higher degree.
  Performance of these operations will however be somewhat degraded due to the
  overhead of enforcing this limit compared to when using a very large limit.

  This limit can be set by passing the `+zosrl` command line argument to `erl`,
  or by calling
  `erlang:system_flag(outstanding_system_requests_limit, NewLimit)`.

### Improvements and New Features

- As of OTP 22, the allocator specific memory carrier pools were replaced by a

  used by allocators mainly handling short lived data.

  A new command line argument `+M<S>cp` has been introduced with which one can
  enable the old behavior as well as configuring other behaviors for the carrier
  pools. In order to configure the old behavior, with allocator specific carrier
  pools for all allocators, pass `+Mucp :` (including the colon character) as a
  command line argument to `erl` when starting the Erlang system.

  The default configuration for carrier pools will be changed to `+Mucp :` some

- Fixed a bug that could cause the emulator to crash when purging modules or
  persistent terms.

  Own Id: OTP-16555 Aux Id: ERL-1188

- Fixed a bug in a receive optimization. This could cause a `receive` not to
  match even though a matching message was present in the message queue. This
  bug was introduced in ERTS version 10.6 (OTP 22.2).

  Own Id: OTP-16572 Aux Id: ERL-1199, OTP-16269

## Erts 10.7

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- `gen_udp:recv(S, N, 0)` corrupted the internal state for the socket so after
  receive with `{active, once}` it always returned `{error, timeout}`, and
  wasted the received UDP packets. This bug has now been fixed.

  Reported and pinpointed by Alexander Petrovsky.

  Own Id: OTP-16059

- The atom esock_atom_user and esock_atom_kernel was never actually created.
  This has now been corrected.

  Own Id: OTP-16381

- Fixed bug in `socket` module that could potentially lead to scheduler
  deadlocks.

  Own Id: OTP-16384

- Fix bug causing VM crash if `down` or `stop` callback of a NIF resource is
  called after the NIF module has been purged. The fix will postpone unloading
  until all such resource objects have been garbage collected.

  Own Id: OTP-16399

- Fixed bug in `ets:update_counter/4`, when called with an invalid `UpdateOp`
  and a `Key` that does not exist, causing `ets:info(T,size)` to return
  incorrect values. Bug exists since OTP-19.0.2.

  Own Id: OTP-16404 Aux Id: ERL-1127

- Fix potential heap corrupting bugs when a process calls a BIF that blocks
  other normal schedulers and then writes to its own heap without the main
  process lock. A NIF running on a dirty scheduler trying to interact with such
  a process could corrupt its heap. The fixed BIFs were related to code loading
  and tracing.

  Own Id: OTP-16417

- Fixed bug in `erlang:list_to_ref/1` when called with a reference created by a
  remote note. Function [`list_to_ref/1`](`list_to_ref/1`) is intended for
  debugging and not to be used in application programs. Bug exist since OTP
  20.0.

  Own Id: OTP-16438

- The prim_net nif (net/kernel) made use of an undefined atom, notsup. This has
  now been corrected.

  Own Id: OTP-16440

- Corrected the valid range of the `erl` command line argument
  [`+SDio <NumberOfDirtyIoSchedulers>`](erl_cmd.md#%2BSDio) from `0..1024` to
  `1..1024`. `+SDio 0` was erroneously allowed which just caused the VM to crash
  on the first dirty I/O job scheduled.

  Own Id: OTP-16481

- Fix a crash when attempting to log faults when loading files during early
  boot.

  Own Id: OTP-16491

### Improvements and New Features

- For [socket](`m:socket#`), not all send and receive flags are supported on all
  platforms. In order to (at least) simplify testing, the
  socket:supports/0,1,2,3 functions has been extended with send_flags and
  recv_flags items, which indicates what the current platform can manage.

  Own Id: OTP-16153

- Add a "full featured" version of getifaddrs in the net module.

  Own Id: OTP-16212 Aux Id: ERL-1070

- The options `busy_limits_port` and `busy_limits_msgq` have been added to the
  BIF `erlang:open_port/2`. The `busy_limits_port` option can be used for
  controlling the busy state of a port executing the `spawn_driver` or the
  `fd_driver`. The `busy_limits_msgq` option can be used for controlling the
  busy state of the port message queue.

  Own Id: OTP-16306 Aux Id: ERIERL-439

- A socket "registry" has been added making it possible to list current open
  sockets.

  Own Id: OTP-16309

- The counters managed by the socket nif has been extended. Their "size" has
  been increased from 32 bit to 64. Two max package size (for read and write)
  has been added. And four accept counters has been added.

  Own Id: OTP-16387

- Add gcc option `-fno-common` to detect accidental name clashes of global
  variables.

  Own Id: OTP-16420 Aux Id: PR-2513

- New dynamic lock checker that verifies locking orders and detects potential
  deadlock bugs in drivers and NIFs. Enabled together with the old static lock
  checker (for ERTS internal locks) in emulator started with `-emu_type debug`
  or built with configuration option `--enable-lock-checking`.

## Erts 10.6.4

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- A process could get into an inconsistent state where it was runnable, but
  never scheduled for execution. This could occur when a mix of `normal` and
  `low` priority processes where scheduled on the same type of dirty scheduler
  simultaneously.

  Own Id: OTP-16446 Aux Id: ERL-1157

## Erts 10.6.3

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- A process could end up in a state where it got endlessly rescheduled without
  making any progress. This occurred when a system task, such as check of
  process code (part of a code purge), was scheduled on a high priority process
  trying to execute on a dirty scheduler.

  Own Id: OTP-16436 Aux Id: ERL-1152

### Improvements and New Features

- Improved signal handling for processes executing dirty. For example, avoid
  busy wait in dirty signal handler process when process is doing garbage
  collection on dirty scheduler.

  Own Id: OTP-16358

## Erts 10.6.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Taking a scheduler offline could cause timers set while executing on that
  scheduler to be delayed until the scheduler was put online again. This bug was
  introduced in ERTS version 10.0 (OTP 21.0).

  Own Id: OTP-16371

- The `ets:update_counter/4` core dumped when given an ordered_set with
  write_concurrency enabled and an invalid position. This bug has been fixed.

  Own Id: OTP-16378 Aux Id: ERL-1125

- A process calling
  [`erlang:system_flag(multi_scheduling, block)`](`m:erlang#system_flag_multi_scheduling`)
  could end up blocked waiting for the operation to complete indefinitely.

  Own Id: OTP-16379

### Improvements and New Features

- Duplicate entries for \[socket:]getopt and \[socket:]setopt in man page.

  Own Id: OTP-16333 Aux Id: ERL-1104

## Erts 10.6.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Corrected an issue with the new socket api which could cause a core dump. A
  race during socket close could cause a core dump (an invalid nif environment
  free).

  Own Id: OTP-16314 Aux Id: ERL-1098

- Corrected an issue with the new socket api which could cause a core dump. When
  multiple accept processes waiting for a connect a connect could cause a core
  dump.

  Own Id: OTP-16359

## Erts 10.6

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- The functions [`unicode:characters_to_list()`](`unicode:characters_to_list/2`)
  and [`unicode:characters_to_binary()`](`unicode:characters_to_binary/3`)
  raised a `badarg` exception instead of returning an error tuple when passed
  very large invalid code points as input.

  Own Id: OTP-16052

- `file:allocate/3` will now work properly on Mac OS.

  Own Id: OTP-16074 Aux Id: ERL-1042, PR-2386

- For [socket](`m:socket#`), invalid encoding of send and receive flags caused
  badarg and send failure.

- Fix a bug in `re` on platforms where the native stack grows upwards, for
  instance on HP PA-RISC.

  Own Id: OTP-16150 Aux Id: ERL-1043

- For [socket](`m:socket#`), unable to properly decode the timestamp control
  message header on FreeBSD. We incorrectly used the SO_TIMESTAMP flag for the
  timestamp control message header type. It should have been SCM_TIMESTAMP. This
  caused the timestamp control message header to not be fully decoded.

  Own Id: OTP-16151 Aux Id: #2400

- For [socket](`m:socket#`), when setting the ip option 'recvtos' to true,
  thereby indicating that we want to receive the TOS control message header, we
  don't actually get TOS but RECVTOS on FreeBSD (and maybe others)\! This was
  previously not handled.

  Own Id: OTP-16152 Aux Id: OTP-16114

- Fixed a bug where the emulator would print out error messages forever if it
  crashed during startup.

  Own Id: OTP-16159 Aux Id: ERL-1060

- For [socket](`m:socket#`), wrong type for protocol caused segmentation fault
  if protocol was provided as \{raw, integer()\}.

  Own Id: OTP-16163 Aux Id: ERL-1061

- For [socket](`m:socket#`), when setting the ip option 'recvttl' to true,
  thereby indicating that we want to receive the TTL control message header, we
  don't actually get TTL but RECVTTL on Solaris (and maybe others)\! This was
  previously not handled.

  Own Id: OTP-16172 Aux Id: OTP-16114

- For [socket](`m:socket#`), IPv6 control message headers was incorrectly
  decoded with level ip instead of ipv6.

  Own Id: OTP-16173

- Fix configure bug where `clock_getres` would not correctly be detected causing
  `erlang:system_info(os_system_time_source)` to return an incorrect resolution.

  This bug effects all OSs that use `clock_gettime` to get time (basically all
  OSs except windows) and has been present since OTP-19.2.

  Own Id: OTP-16191 Aux Id: ERL-1067

- Fix bugs when using `ERLC_USE_SERVER=true` on Windows when building
  Erlang/OTP.

  Change the cookie used by the compile server to be hard coded instead of using
  the users cookie.

  Own Id: OTP-16192

- Fix so that `persistent_term` is listed in the erts application file.

  Own Id: OTP-16194

- Fix bug in call_time tracing which could sometimes cause call time
  measurements being attributed to the wrong function.

  Own Id: OTP-16195 Aux Id: ERL-1027

- The [socket](`m:socket#`) socket option 'peek_off' has been disabled. If
  peek_off was set and then socket:recv/3 was called with the peek flag, the
  call could hang.

  Own Id: OTP-16196

- Handle possibly uninitiated (control message header) data.

  Own Id: OTP-16197

- For [net](`m:net#`), a couple of NI macros was deprecated in new versions of
  glibc, so these are no longer used (IDN_ALLOW_UNASSIGNED and
  IDN_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES).

  Own Id: OTP-16203

- The string value from a get operation needed to be truncated.

  Own Id: OTP-16204

- Fix misleading seq_trace message for remote send operation toward named
  process. Changed receiver to be `{Name,Node}` instead of just `Name`.

  Own Id: OTP-16206 Aux Id: PR-2423

- Fixed a bug causing actual nodedown reason reported by
  [`net_kernel:monitor_nodes(true, [nodedown_reason])`](`net_kernel:monitor_nodes/2`)
  to be lost and replaced by the reason `killed`.

  Own Id: OTP-16216

- For [socket](`m:socket#`), the timestamp creation used when printing warning
  messages and debug printouts did not work. The used buffer was too small.

  Own Id: OTP-16223

- Fix compiler warnings generated by GCC 8

  Own Id: OTP-16235

- Fix `erl -emu_type` to accept the option `opt` which means the normal
  optimized emulator. This can be used to override the `-emu_type` option from
  environment variables.

  Own Id: OTP-16297

- Corrected the function spec to reflect the actual code of the function
  socket:bind.

  Own Id: OTP-16310 Aux Id: ERL-1082

- Fixed a performance issue in ETS lookup when using the `compressed` option and
  the term contained atoms. Before this fix the decompress algorithm for atoms
  would unnecessarily take a global lock to validate the atom.

  Own Id: OTP-16316

### Improvements and New Features

- For [socket](`m:socket#`), not all send and receive flags are supported on all
  platforms. In order to (at least) simplify testing, the
  socket:supports/0,1,2,3 functions has been extended with send_flags and
  recv_flags items, which indicates what the current platform can manage.

  Own Id: OTP-16153

- For [socket](`m:socket#`), add support for IPv6 socket options tclass and
  recvtclass. Both has been added, but the use of them are platform dependent.
  Call socket:supports(options, ipv6, Opt) to be sure what option to use in
  order to request a TCLASS control message header.

  Own Id: OTP-16180

- For [socket](`m:socket#`), the TCP socket option cork was not supported even
  though the supports function reported it as such.

  Own Id: OTP-16205

- The Kernel application's User's Guide now contain a Logger Cookbook with
  common usage patterns.

  Own Id: OTP-16208

- Add a "full featured" version of getifaddrs in the net module.

  Own Id: OTP-16212 Aux Id: ERL-1070

- Fix an inefficiency introduced by the bug fix in OTP-16241 which fixed a
  problem with the receive optimization. That bug fix introduced an inefficiency
  when using the receive optimization and a burst of messages arrive at once
  when the receiving process' mailbox was empty.

  Own Id: OTP-16269 Aux Id: OTP-16241

- For [socket](`m:socket#`), added support for the socket option extended_err.
  Andreas Schultz.

  Own Id: OTP-16302 Aux Id: #2449

- ETS tables have been optimized to not use any locks when running in a system
  with only one scheduler enabled. This can provide significant performance
  gains for applications that use ETS tables heavily.

  Own Id: OTP-16315

## Erts 10.5.6

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Large amounts of quickly executed dirty work could cause heavy contention on
  an internal spin lock. The spin lock was replaced by a mutex which behaves
  much better under these conditions.

  Own Id: OTP-16301 Aux Id: ERL-1079

## Erts 10.5.5

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- A literal area could prematurely be released before all uses of it had been
  removed. This occurred either when a terminating process had a complex exit
  reason referring to a literal that concurrently was removed, or when a
  terminating process continued executing a dirty NIF accessing a literal (via
  the heap) that concurrently was removed.

  Own Id: OTP-16193

- Fix bug causing VM crash due to memory corruption of distribution entry.
  Probability of crash increases if Erlang distribution is frequently
  disconnected and reestablished towards same node names. Bug exists since
  OTP-21.0.

  Own Id: OTP-16224 Aux Id: ERL-1044

- Fixed bug causing crash of VM built with configuration
  `--enable--sharing-preserving`. Provoked when a sent message contains both a
  bit string and the heap binary (< 65 bytes) which the bit string was matched
  from. Bug exists since OTP-19.0 but has seen to be easier to provoke since
  OTP-22.1.

  Own Id: OTP-16265 Aux Id: ERL-1064

## Erts 10.5.4

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- The compiler could do an unsafe optimization of receives, which would cause a
  receive to only scan part of the message queue.

  This bug fix in the compiler fixes a bug in the socket module.

  Own Id: OTP-16219 Aux Id: ERL-1076

- Fix bug where the receive marker used by the runtime to do the receive queue
  optimization could be incorrectly set. The symptom of this would be that a
  message that should match in a receive never matches.

  The bug requires the OTP-22 compiler and multiple selective receives to
  trigger. See OTP-16219 for details about the bug fix in the compiler.

## Erts 10.5.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- A terminating process sending distributed `'EXIT'` or `'DOWN'` signals while
  terminating could end up in a state where no progress at all was made. This
  was triggered by a distribution channel that the terminating process was
  sending on got busy. This bug has existed since ERTS version 10.4 (OTP 22.0).

  Own Id: OTP-16069

- When communicating with a simultaneously exiting port via the
  `erlang:port_*()` BIFs one could sometimes get stray `{Ref, What}` messages.
  Where `Ref` was a reference and `What` usually were the atom `badarg`.

  Own Id: OTP-16107 Aux Id: ERL-1049

## Erts 10.5

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- If you set `{linger,{true,0}}` on a `gen_tcp` listen socket, accept a
  connection on that socket, and then close the accepted socket, now the linger
  zero setting is transferred to the accepted socket. Before this correction
  that information was lost and the close behaviour on the accepted socket
  incorrect.

  Own Id: OTP-15370 Aux Id: ERIERL-353

- Sending ancillary data implemented in OTP-15747 accidentally left behind test
  code that caused all UDP sends to fail on Windows. This has now been fixed.

  Own Id: OTP-15422 Aux Id: OTP-15747

- In the socket nif, used invalid flags when if-def'ing for supported TCP flags:
  TCP_MAXSEG and TCP_NODELAY (the support function).

- Fixed memory leaks in experimental socket module.

  Own Id: OTP-15830

- `re:run()` now yields when validating utf8 in a large subject.

  Own Id: OTP-15836 Aux Id: ERL-876

- Fixed bug in `seq_trace:set_token(label,Term)` which could cause VM crash if
  `Term` was heap allocated (not an atom, small integer, local pid or port). Bug
  exists since OTP 21.0 when terms other than small integers were first allowed
  as labels.

  compiler does not support pgo.

  Own Id: OTP-15853 Aux Id: PR-2254

- Fixed hipe_flush_icache_range for non-Linux OS on ARM.

  Own Id: OTP-15874 Aux Id: ERL-958, PR-2266

  optimization in some cases where it was safe.

  Own Id: OTP-15881

- Upgraded the ERTS internal PCRE library from version 8.42 to version 8.43. See
  [http://pcre.org/original/changelog.txt](http://pcre.org/original/changelog.txt)

- Allow more than one `-config` command line option to `erl` on Windows to
  conform with other OS.

  Own Id: OTP-15918 Aux Id: ERL-912

- Fix so that ERL_FLAGS environment variable does not interfere with command
  line arguments. Before this fix you could write:

  `ERL_FLAGS="10" erl +S`

  and erlang would start as if `+S` had been given the argument `10`.

  Own Id: OTP-15931

- The bug with ID ERL-717 has been fixed. The functions `io:columns()` and
  `io:rows()` only worked correctly inside interactive erlang shells before this
  fix. These functions returned `{error,enotsup}` before this fix even if stdout
  and stdin were connected to a terminal when they were invoked from an escript
  or a program started with e.g., `erl -noshell`.

  Own Id: OTP-15959 Aux Id: ERL-717

- Do not use named label in `ethread.c` inline assemble. This allows erts to be
  compiled using gcc 9.1.0 with LTO enabled.

  Own Id: OTP-15975 Aux Id: ERL-1009

- [`process_info(P,binary)`](`process_info/2`) would neglect to look through
  heap fragments, potentially missing a few binaries associated with the
  process.

  Own Id: OTP-15978 Aux Id: ERIERL-366

- HiPE is now automatically disabled on systems with non-glibc implementation
  (for instance musl). This is because musl does not provide the API's for
  guaranteeing that signals are delivered on the correct native stack.

  Own Id: OTP-16037

- Fixed bug triggered if a process is killed during call to

  system for each file to be compiled in a multi-file project. See the
  documentation for how to enable it.

  Own Id: OTP-15738 Aux Id: PR-2361

- The possibility to send ancillary data, in particular the TOS field, has been

- The net module has been split into 'net' (kernel) and prim_net (preloaded).

  Own Id: OTP-15765

- Socket counters now works as expected and can also be extracted with the (new)
  info function.

  Own Id: OTP-15818

- `re:run()` now avoids validating utf8 in the subject more than once in the
  same call. This validation could previously be performed multiple times when
  the `global` option was passed.

  Own Id: OTP-15831 Aux Id: ERL-876

- The un-documented function `erlang:dist_get_stat/1` now returns the real value
  of what the distribution queue contains instead of a boolean.

  Own Id: OTP-15905 Aux Id: PR-2270

- ETS `ordered_set` tables with `write_concurrency` enabled has got a
  performance issue fixed. There were no limits for the values of internal
  statistics counters before this fix. This could result in that the data
  structure sometimes reacted slowly to a change in how many parallel processes
  were using it.

  Own Id: OTP-15906

- Optimize the reception of large distribution messages.

  Own Id: OTP-15926 Aux Id: PR-2291

- Binary matching and functions like [`split_binary/2`](`split_binary/2`) will
  now create heap binaries when the results are small enough, reducing the
  chances of small sub-binaries keeping large binaries alive.

  Own Id: OTP-15977 Aux Id: ERIERL-366

- Fixed rare emulator crash in `instrument:allocations/0-1`.

  Own Id: OTP-15983

- Ports could pass very small binaries as reference counted off heap binaries to
  processes. This could cause an unnecessary large memory usage and an
  unnecessary load on the binary allocator. Small binaries are now always passed
  as heap binaries to processes.

  Own Id: OTP-16001 Aux Id: ERIERL-366

- `unicode:characters_to_binary()` could return very small binaries as reference
  counted off heap binaries. This could cause an unnecessary large memory usage

  functions.

  Own Id: OTP-16028 Aux Id: PR-2362

  `list_to_existing_atom/2` was used with the `latin1` encoding.

  Own Id: OTP-15819 Aux Id: ERL-944

- The runtime system disconnected a connection if it received an
  [`exit/2`](`exit/2`) signal where the recipient was a process on an old

## Erts 10.4.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixed [`process_info(Pid,reductions)`](`process_info/2`) to not categorically
  increase reduction count of the measured process `Pid`. Repeated reduction
  measure of an idle process will most often (but not guaranteed) return the

- In nested use of `try`/`catch`, rethrowing an exception using `erlang:raise/3`
  with a different class would not always be able to change the class of the
  exception.

## Erts 10.4

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Do not allocate new bitstring/binary when an empty binary is appended.

  Own Id: OTP-15535 Aux Id: PR-2055

- Document that [`process_info(_, current_function)`](`process_info/2`) can
  return `{current_function, undefined}` in case of execution of native code.

  Own Id: OTP-15543 Aux Id: PR-2089

- Fixed bug in `ets:select`, `ets:match` and friends which could cause the table
  to remain fixated (as if `ets:safe_fixtable` had been called) after the call
  returned. This could happen for `protected` tables if another concurrent
  running process transferred table ownership to the process during its
  ets:select/match call. Ownership can be transferred using either
  `ets:give_away` or the `heir` table option.

  Own Id: OTP-15672

- Fixed a Windows-specific bug in `file:list_dir/1` that caused it to misbehave
  on network shares.

  Own Id: OTP-15693

- Fixed bug when calling `enif_whereis_*` from NIF resource destructor. Symptoms
  could be emulator crash or hanging scheduler threads.

  Own Id: OTP-15694 Aux Id: ERL-863

- Fixed a bug in the error case of [`apply/3`](`apply/3`), where the exception
  would erroneously have an empty argument list in some cases.

  Own Id: OTP-15698

- A bug has been fixed in the `maps` implementation that could cause a crash or
  memory usage to grow until the machine ran out of memory. This could happen
  when inserting a new key-value pair with a key `K1` containing a binary `B1`
  into a map `M` having a key `K2` with a binary `B2` if the following
  conditions were met:

  - `B1 =/= B2`
  - `size(B1) >= 4294967296`
  - `size(B2) >= 4294967296`
  - `size(M) >= 32`
  - `(size(B1) rem 4294967296) == (size(B2) rem 4294967296)`
  - the first `(size(B1) rem 4294967296)` bytes are the same both in `B1` and
    `B2`
  - substituting `B1` in `K1` with `B2` would create a term with the same value
    as `K2`

  The root cause of the problem is that the `maps` implementation only hashed
  the first `(X rem 4294967296)` bytes of binaries so that different binaries
  could get the same hash value independently of the hash seed.

  Own Id: OTP-15707

- `term_to_binary()` and distributed sends will now throw a `system_limit`
  exception instead of producing erroneous results when trying to encode a
  binary larger than 4 GB.

  Own Id: OTP-15708

- The vxworks configure has been updated to respect the environment CFLAGS.

  Own Id: OTP-15773

- Fix configure to not enable PGO (profile guided optimizations) when linking of
  the PGO binary fails. For instance this happens when there is no gcov lib
  installed.

  Own Id: OTP-15788

- Fix bug on OpenBSD where sockets using `active, true` or `active, N` could
  cause the system to live lock. The bug was introduced in erts-10.2 (OTP-21.2).

  Own Id: OTP-15791

### Improvements and New Features

- Add support for Erlang Distribution protocol to split the payload of large
  signals into several fragments. This allows other processes to communicate
  uninterrupted during the transmission of these signals.

  Own Id: OTP-13397

- A simple socket API is provided through the socket module. This is a low level
  API that does _not_ replace gen\_\[tcp|udp|sctp]. It is intended to
  _eventually_ replace the inet driver, but not the high level gen-modules
  (gen_tcp, gen_udp and gen_sctp). It also provides a basic API that facilitates
  the implementation of other protocols, that is TCP, UDP and SCTP.

  Known issues are; No support for the Windows OS (currently).

  Own Id: OTP-14831

- Added NIF functions
  [`enif_set_pid_undefined`](erl_nif.md#enif_set_pid_undefined),
  [`enif_is_pid_undefined`](erl_nif.md#enif_is_pid_undefined) and
  [`enif_compare_pids`](erl_nif.md#enif_compare_pids).

  Own Id: OTP-15011 Aux Id: PR-2147

- Underutilized memory segments (carriers) can now move between all allocator
  instances, rather than just between instances of the same type, which greatly
  reduces memory usage in some scenarios.

  Own Id: OTP-15063

- The emulator will now mark free blocks in pooled carriers with
  `madvise(2) + MADV_FREE` (or similar), letting the OS reclaim the associated
  physical memory if necessary.

  Own Id: OTP-15075

- New `ERL_NIF_SELECT_CANCEL` feature added to `enif_select` in order to cancel
  (or "deselect") a read or write event on a previously selected file
  descriptor.

  Own Id: OTP-15095

- ETS option `write_concurrency` now also affects and improves the scalability
  of `ordered_set` tables. The implementation is based on a data structure
  called contention adapting search tree, where the lock granularity adapts to
  the actual amount of concurrency exploited by the applications in runtime.

  Own Id: OTP-15128

- Build configuration of the `crypto` application has been moved from the `erts`
  application into the `crypto` application.

  Own Id: OTP-15129

- Anonymous functions that don't capture environment are now created at
  load-time instead of in run-time.

  Own Id: OTP-15195 Aux Id: PR-1812

- Optimize updates of maps with identical keys and values. E.g. in the example
  below the original Map will be reused as the return of the update.

  1> Map = #\{ a => b \}. #\{ a => b \} 2> Map#\{ a := b \}.

- Optimize `binary:match/2` and `binary:matches/2` to use memchr internally.

  Own Id: OTP-15238 Aux Id: PR-1803

- The runtime system used to terminate when a message larger than 2 Gb was
  passed over the distribution. The send operation will now instead throw a
  `system_limit` exception.

  Own Id: OTP-15261

- Change the first module called by erts to be named erl_init instead of
  otp_ring0. systools in sasl have been updated to reflect this change.

  Own Id: OTP-15336 Aux Id: PR-1825

- Minor adjustments made to build system for parallel configure.

  Own Id: OTP-15340 Aux Id: OTP-14625

- Two new NIF interface functions `enif_select_read` and `enif_select_write`.
  They are similar to existing `enif_select` but allow a custom event message as
  an argument.

  Own Id: OTP-15349 Aux Id: PR-2084

- The embedded copy of `zlib` has been updated from `1.2.8` to `1.2.11`.

  Note that this copy is only used as a fallback when the target platform
  doesn't provide any `zlib` development libraries. If your system provides
  `zlib` then it will be used even if it is older than `1.2.11`.

  Own Id: OTP-15351 Aux Id: ERL-749

- New NIF function `enif_make_monitor_term`.

  Own Id: OTP-15362 Aux Id: PR-2127

- Appending lists (The ++ operator) will now yield properly on large inputs.

  Own Id: OTP-15427

- The [`length/1`](`length/1`) BIF used to calculate the length of the list in
  one go without yielding, even if the list was very long. In OTP 22,
  [`length/1`](`length/1`) will yield when called with long lists.

  Own Id: OTP-15439

- Processes sending messages are now punished with a reduction cost based on
  message size. That is, a process sending a large message will yield earlier
  than before.

  Own Id: OTP-15513 Aux Id: ERL-773

- The transitory emulator option `+ztma true` (introduced in OTP 21.3) has been
  removed.

  Own Id: OTP-15581 Aux Id: OTP-15580

- In OTP 22, HiPE (the native code compiler) is not fully functional. The
  reasons for this are:

  There are new BEAM instructions for binary matching that the HiPE native code
  compiler does not support.

  The new optimizations in the Erlang compiler create new combination of
  instructions that HiPE currently does not handle correctly.

  If erlc is invoked with the `+native` option, and if any of the new binary
  matching instructions are used, the compiler will issue a warning and produce
  a BEAM file without native code.

  Own Id: OTP-15596

- The termination behaviour of processes has changed to allow processes to yield
  while sending link exit/monitor down signals.

  The erl crash dump has been expanded to now also include processes that are
  termeinating but have not yet terminated.

  Own Id: OTP-15610

- The dist messages EXIT, EXIT2 and MONITOR_DOWN have been updated with new
  versions that send the reason term as part of the payload of the message
  instead of as part of the control message.

  The old versions are still present and can be used when communicating with
  nodes that don't support the new versions.

  Own Id: OTP-15611

- When sending messages, exit, exit2 and monitor down distributed signals, the
  process sending will now yield appropriately.

  This means that a terminating process will yield and possibly be suspended on
  busy distribution entries while they are terminating. This means that any
  memory held by such processes will not be released until after all
  exit/monitor down signals have been sent.

  Own Id: OTP-15612

- All external pids/ports/refs created by erlang:list_to_pid/port/ref debug
  functions now compare equal to any other pid/port/ref with the same number
  from that node.

  Before this change they compared differently because the node creation of the
  pid/port/ref did not compare equal to any real pid/port/ref creation.

  This will mostly effect pids/ports/refs typed in the shell.

  Own Id: OTP-15613

- The `persistent_term` functions [`put/2`](`put/2`) and [`erase/1`](`erase/1`)
  are now yielding.

  Own Id: OTP-15615

- A new
  [`erlang:dist_ctrl_set_opt(DHandle, get_size, Value)`](`erlang:dist_ctrl_set_opt/3`)
  option has been added. This option makes it possible to configure the
  distribution channel identified by `DHandle` so that
  [`erlang:dist_ctrl_get_data(DHandle)`](`erlang:dist_ctrl_get_data/1`) also
  returns the size of the data to pass over the channel.

  Own Id: OTP-15617

- Previously, all ETS tables used centralized counter variables to keep track of
  the number of items stored and the amount of memory consumed. These counters
  can cause scalability problems (especially on big NUMA systems). This change
  adds an implementation of a decentralized counter and modifies the
  implementation of ETS so that ETS tables of type `ordered_set` with
  `write_concurrency` enabled use the decentralized counter. Experiments
  indicate that this change substantially improves the scalability of ETS
  `ordered_set` tables with `write_concurrency` enabled in scenarios with
  frequent `ets:insert/2` and `ets:delete/2` calls.

  Own Id: OTP-15623 Aux Id: PR-2190

- The [`iolist_size/1`](`iolist_size/1`) function is now yielding which means
  that an Erlang/OTP system will be responsive even if the applications running
  on the system frequently call [`iolist_size/1`](`iolist_size/1`) with large
  iolists.

  Own Id: OTP-15631

- A simple test suite for the net module has been added.

  Own Id: OTP-15635

- Added the NIF function `enif_term_type`, which helps avoid long sequences of
  `enif_is_xyz` by returning the type of the given term. This is especially
  helpful for NIFs that serialize terms, such as JSON encoders, where it can
  improve both performance and readability.

  Own Id: OTP-15640

- The last call optimization is now applied to BIFs. When calling a BIF in the
  tail position of a function, the return address and stack frame will now be
  discarded before calling the BIF. As a consequence of this change, the
  immediate caller of a tail-called BIF will no longer be available in stack
  backtraces.

  Own Id: OTP-15674 Aux Id: PR-2177

- Fix GC bug where distributed messages in a processes mailbox would cause extra
  GCs. This can be very expensive if there many messages in the mailbox.

  Own Id: OTP-15703

- Internal documentation has now been added to the _Erts_ and _Compiler_
  applications.

  The internal documents for _Erts_ describe miscellaneous interesting
  implementation details. Those details can change at any time.

  The internal documentation for _Compiler_ documents the API for the Core
  Erlang modules. While we will not change those APIs without good reason, we
  don't give the same guarantees about backward compatibility as for the rest of
  the APIs in OTP.

  Own Id: OTP-15715

- The performance of non-bignum integer arithmetic has been improved.

  Own Id: OTP-15740

- The `-remsh` option to `erl` now automatically adds the local systems hostname
  to the target node if no nodename is given. e.g.

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fix bug in match spec compilator seen to cause a stack overflow crash on debug
  VM for certain match specs. Could potentially cause problems for standard VM,
  but has not been verified. Match specs are used by `ets:match/select`
  functions and `erlang:trace_pattern`.

- A call to `port_command()` could cause a scheduler to end up in an eternal
  loop if the port was busy and the calling process had incoming signals at the
  time of the call. This bug was introduced in OTP 23.3.2 (ERTS version 11.2.1),
  OTP 22.3.4.18 (ERTS version 10.7.2.10), and OTP 21.3.8.23 (ERTS version

## Erts 10.3.5.18

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- The following signals could pass before other signals from the same sender to
  the same receiver. That is, these signals could arrive too early.

  - `garbage-collect` request. Sent from one process to another using one of the
    `garbage_collect/0` BIFs.
  - `check-process-code` request. Sent from one process to another using one of
    the `check_process_code()` BIFs.
  - `is-process-alive` reply. Sent as a response to a process calling the
    `is_process_alive()` BIF.
  - `process-info` reply. Sent as a response to a process calling one of the
    `process_info()` BIFs.
  - `port-command` reply. Sent as a response to a process calling one of the

- A garbage collection of a literal area missed messages that entirely consisted
  of a term in a literal area. This could in turn lead to a crash of the runtime
  system.

  Own Id: OTP-17307

- A call to [`process_flag(message_queue_data, off_heap)`](`process_flag/2`)
  could cause a crash of the runtime system when sequential tracing was enabled.

  Own Id: OTP-17349

## Erts 10.3.5.17

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixed a bug in the timer implementation which could cause timers that were set
  to more than 37.25 hours in the future to be delayed. This could occur if
  there were multiple timers scheduled to be triggered very close in time, but
  still at different times, and the scheduler thread handling the timers was not
  able to handle them quickly enough. Delayed timers were in this case triggered
  when another unrelated timer was triggered.

  Own Id: OTP-17253

### Improvements and New Features

- Fix a file descriptor leak when using sendfile and the remote side closes the
  connection. This bug has been present since OTP-21.0.

  Own Id: OTP-17244

## Erts 10.3.5.16

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixed a bug that could cause some work scheduled for execution on scheduler
  threads to be delayed until other similar work appeared. Beside delaying
  various cleanup of internal data structures also the following could be
  delayed:

  - Termination of a distribution controller process
  - Disabling of the distribution on a node
  - Gathering of memory allocator information using the `instrument` module
  - Enabling, disabling, and gathering of `msacc` information
  - Delivery of `'CHANGE'` messages when time offset is monitored
  - A call to `erlang:cancel_timer()`
  - A call to `erlang:read_timer()`
  - A call to `erlang:statistics(io | garbage_collection | scheduler_wall_time)`
  - A call to `ets:all()`
  - A call to `erlang:memory()`
  - A call to `erlang:system_info({allocator | allocator_sizes, _})`
  - A call to `erlang:trace_delivered()`

  The bug existed on runtime systems running on all types of hardware except for
  x86/x86_64.

- The ERTS internal I/O poll implementation could get into an inconsistent state
  causing input events to be ignored.

  Own Id: OTP-16780 Aux Id: PR-2701

- The documentation of [`statistics(run_queue)`](`statistics/1`) erroneously
  stated that it returns the total length of all normal run queues when it is
  the total length of all normal and dirty CPU run queues that is returned. The
  documentation has been updated to reflect the actual behavior.

  Own Id: OTP-16866 Aux Id: ERL-1355

- Two bugs in the ERTS internal thread wakeup functionality have been fixed.
  These bugs mainly hit when all threads in the system tried to go to sleep.
  When the bugs were triggered, certain operations were delayed until a thread
  woke up due to some other reason. Most important operations effected were code
  loading, persistent term updates, and memory deallocation.

  Own Id: OTP-16870

- Fixed bug in `ets:select_replace/2` on `compressed` tables that could produce
  faulty results or VM crash. Bug exists since OTP 20.

  Own Id: OTP-16874 Aux Id: ERL-1356, PR-2763

## Erts 10.3.5.13

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- An unintentional reuse of an already used emulator internal event object could
  cause a wakeup signal to a thread to be lost. In worst case this could cause
  the runtime system to hang. This hang was however quite rare.

  Own Id: OTP-16766 Aux Id: ERL-1304

- NIF threads and driver threads on non-Linux systems leaked internal resources
  when terminating. On Windows these resources were one event per thread. On
  most other systems one mutex and one condition variable per thread. On these
  other systems that also lacked `pthread_cond_timedwait()` also a pipe with its
  file descriptors was leaked.

## Erts 10.3.5.12

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- The functionality utilized by BIFs for temporary disabling of garbage
  collection while yielding could cause system task queues to become
  inconsistent on a process executing such a BIF. Process system tasks are for
  example utilized when purging code, garbage collecting literal data, and when
  issuing an ordinary garbage collection from another process.

  The bug does not trigger frequently. Multiple code purges in direct sequence
  makes it more likely that this bug is triggered. In the cases observed, this
  has resulted in a hanging code purge operation.

  Own Id: OTP-16639 Aux Id: ERL-1236

- A literal area could prematurely be released before all uses of it had been
  removed. This occurred either when a terminating process had a complex exit
  reason referring to a literal that concurrently was removed, or when a
  terminating process continued executing a dirty NIF accessing a literal (via
  the heap) that concurrently was removed.

  Own Id: OTP-16640 Aux Id: OTP-16193

- The VM could potentially crash when checking process code of a process that
  terminated while executing a dirty NIF. The checking of process code is part
  of a code purge operation.

  Own Id: OTP-16641

- System tasks of `low` priority were not interleaved with `normal` priority
  system tasks as they should. This could potentially delay garbage collection
  of another process longer than intended if the garbage collection was
  requested from a `low` priority process.

  Own Id: OTP-16642

## Erts 10.3.5.11

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- [re:run(Subject, RE, \[unicode])](`re:run/3`) returned `nomatch` instead of
  failing with a `badarg` error exception when `Subject` contained illegal utf8
  and `RE` was passed as a binary. This has been corrected along with
  corrections of reduction counting in `re:run()` error cases.

  incorrect values. Bug exists since OTP-19.0.2.

  Own Id: OTP-16404 Aux Id: ERL-1127

- A process could get into an inconsistent state where it was runnable, but

  `low` priority processes where scheduled on the same type of dirty scheduler
  simultaneously.

  Own Id: OTP-16446 Aux Id: ERL-1157

- Corrected the valid range of the `erl` command line argument
  [`+SDio <NumberOfDirtyIoSchedulers>`](erl_cmd.md#%2BSDio) from `0..1024` to
  `1..1024`. `+SDio 0` was erroneously allowed which just caused the VM to crash
  on the first dirty I/O job scheduled.

  Own Id: OTP-16481

## Erts 10.3.5.9

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- A process could end up in a state where it got endlessly rescheduled without
  making any progress. This occurred when a system task, such as check of
  process code (part of a code purge), was scheduled on a high priority process
  trying to execute on a dirty scheduler.

  Own Id: OTP-16436 Aux Id: ERL-1152

- Fixed bug in `erlang:list_to_ref/1` when called with a reference created by a

  debugging and not to be used in application programs. Bug exist since OTP
  20.0.

  Own Id: OTP-16438

## Erts 10.3.5.8

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Taking a scheduler offline could cause timers set while executing on that
  scheduler to be delayed until the scheduler was put online again. This bug was
  introduced in ERTS version 10.0 (OTP 21.0).

  Own Id: OTP-16371

  code for some inputs on 64-bit platforms.

  Own Id: OTP-15939

- Fixed bug causing scheduler threads in rare cases to block spinnning
  indefinitely. Bug exists since OTP 21.0.

## Erts 10.3.5.3

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- If you set `{linger,{true,0}}` on a `gen_tcp` listen socket, accept a
  connection on that socket, and then close the accepted socket, now the linger
  zero setting is transferred to the accepted socket. Before this correction
  that information was lost and the close behaviour on the accepted socket
  incorrect.

  Own Id: OTP-15370 Aux Id: ERIERL-353

- Fixed [`process_info(Pid,reductions)`](`process_info/2`) to not categorically
  increase reduction count of the measured process `Pid`. Repeated reduction
  measure of an idle process will most often (but not guaranteed) return the
  same value, like it behaved before OTP 21.3.8.

  Own Id: OTP-15865 Aux Id: ERL-964

- The runtime system disconnected a connection if it received an
  [`exit/2`](`exit/2`) signal where the recipient was a process on an old
  incarnation of the current node. That is, the receiving node had the same node
  name, but another "creation" number. The signal will now just be dropped since
  the receiving process no longer exists.

  Own Id: OTP-15867 Aux Id: ERIERL-373

### Improvements and New Features

- The possibility to send ancillary data, in particular the TOS field, has been
  added to `gen_udp:send/4,5`.

  Own Id: OTP-15747 Aux Id: ERIERL-294

## Erts 10.3.5.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- In nested use of `try`/`catch`, rethrowing an exception using `erlang:raise/3`
  with a different class would not always be able to change the class of the
  exception.

  Own Id: OTP-15834 Aux Id: ERIERL-367

- Fixed bug in `seq_trace:set_token(label,Term)` which could cause VM crash if
  `Term` was heap allocated (not an atom, small integer, local pid or port). Bug
  exists since OTP 21.0 when terms other than small integers were first allowed
  as labels.

  Own Id: OTP-15849 Aux Id: ERL-700

- Fix `seq_trace:print/2` not to raise `badarg` exception if label is not a
  small integer. Bug exists since OTP 21.0.

  Own Id: OTP-15859 Aux Id: ERL-700

## Erts 10.3.5.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixed a buffer overflow when
  [`binary_to_existing_atom/2`](`binary_to_existing_atom/2`) and
  `list_to_existing_atom/2` was used with the `latin1` encoding.

  Own Id: OTP-15819 Aux Id: ERL-944

## Erts 10.3.5

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixed more bugs in [`process_info(reductions)`](`process_info/1`) causing it
  to sometimes behave non-monotonic. That is, a subsequent call toward the same
  process could return a lower reduction value.

  Own Id: OTP-15793 Aux Id: ERIERL-337, OTP-15709

## Erts 10.3.4

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Add missing documentation of new external tags `NEW_PID`, `NEW_PORT` and
  `NEWER_REFERENCE` introduced in OTP 19.

  These new tags are planned to be "activated" in OTP 23 when distribution
  capability flag `DFLAG_BIG_CREATION` becomes mandatory. Older nodes (>= 19)
  are able to decode these new tags and send them back to the new node. Nodes
  older than OTP 23 will however never encode their own local pids, ports and
  references using the new tags.

  Own Id: OTP-15766

## Erts 10.3.3

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fix `erlang:open_port/2` with the `fd` option to correctly cleanup the pollset
  when the port is closed. Before this fix there would be error printouts sent
  to logger when the same fd was reused in a new port.

  Own Id: OTP-15753 Aux Id: ERL-900

## Erts 10.3.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixed a bug in `seq_trace:reset_trace/0` that could crash the emulator.

  sometimes return invalid results.

  Own Id: OTP-15709 Aux Id: ERIERL-337

## Erts 10.3.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- If a suspend/resume signal pair was sent to a process while it was executing
  dirty, the receiving process could later end up in a suspended state
  indefinitely. This bug was introduced in ERTS version 10.0 (OTP 21.0).

  Suspend/resume signals are sent from
  [`erlang:suspend_process()`](`erlang:suspend_process/1`)/[`erlang:resume_process()`](`erlang:resume_process/1`).
  The `m:dbg` trace tool utilize this functionality and could thus trigger this
  bug.

  not releasing it's run-queue lock when terminating.

  Own Id: OTP-15690 Aux Id: PR-2172

## Erts 10.3

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- When multiplying a number by itself, a word beyond the number on the heap
  could be read (and ignored). This bug was extremely unlikely to actually cause
  a real problem.

  Own Id: OTP-15484

- Fix bug where doing `seq_trace:reset_trace()` while another process was doing
  a garbage collection could cause the run-time system to segfault.

  Own Id: OTP-15490

- Fix reading of ancillary data from packet oriented sockets on old Linux kernel
  versions. Without this fix, getting the data would cause the port to enter an
  infinite loop.

  Own Id: OTP-15494

- Fix bug where crash dumping or doing `erlang:system_info(procs)` while another
  process was doing a garbage collection could cause the run-time system to
  segfault.

- Fix `erlang:system_info(kernel_poll)` to return correct value. Before this
  fix, the call always returned `false`.

  Own Id: OTP-15556

- Fix bug in `enif_make_map_from_arrays` that would produce broken maps when
  number of keys were 32. Bug exists since OTP 21.0.

  memory.

  The bug existed since the function was added (OTP R16B02).

  Own Id: OTP-15583 Aux Id: PR-2118

- Fixed a bug that could cause `heart` to kill an exiting node before it had
  time to flush all buffered writes. If environment variable
  `HEART_KILL_SIGNAL=SIGABRT` was set a superfluous core dump could also be
  generated.

  Own Id: OTP-15599 Aux Id: ERIERL-298

- Fixed a bug in all `ets:select*` and `ets:match*` functions that could in some
  rare cases lead to very poor performance.

  Own Id: OTP-15660 Aux Id: ERL-869

### Improvements and New Features

- Add `erlang:system_flag(system_logger, Pid)` and
  `erlang:system_info(system_logger)`. This system_flag can be used to set the
  process that will receive the logging messages generated by ERTS.

  Own Id: OTP-15375

- [`integer_to_list/2`](`integer_to_list/2`) and
  [`integer_to_binary/2`](`integer_to_binary/2`) are now implemented in C,
  improving their performance.

  Own Id: OTP-15503 Aux Id: PR-2052

- Improved `term_to_binary` to do more fair reduction count and yielding when
  encoding large byte lists (strings).

  Own Id: OTP-15514 Aux Id: ERL-774

- Fix bug on NetBSD where the `exit_status` from a port program would never be
  sent.

  Own Id: OTP-15558 Aux Id: ERL-725

- There is a new function `persistent:term(Key, Default)` to allow specifying a
  default when looking up a persistent term.

  Own Id: OTP-15576 Aux Id: ERL-843

- A transitory emulator option '`+ztma true`' has been added to allow running
  existing BEAM code that relies on "tuple calls" (dispatch on parameterized
  modules) which has been compiled under OTP 20 or earlier. This option will be
  removed in OTP 22, so such modules should eventually be recompiled with the
  `+tuple_calls` option.

  Own Id: OTP-15580 Aux Id: PR-2113

## Erts 10.2.5

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixes of install/release phase in build system.

  - The source tree was modified when installing/releasing and/or applying a
    patch.
  - Some files were installed with wrong access rights.
  - If applying a patch (using `otp_patch_apply`) as another user (except root)
    than the user that built the source, the documentation was not properly
    updated.

  Own Id: OTP-15551

- Setting the `recbuf` size of an inet socket the `buffer` is also automatically
  increased. Fix a bug where the auto adjustment of inet buffer size would be
  triggered even if an explicit inet buffer size had already been set.

  Own Id: OTP-15651 Aux Id: ERIERL-304

- Reading from UDP using active `true` or active `N` mode has been optimized
  when more packets than specified by `read_packets` are available on the
  socket.

  Own Id: OTP-15652 Aux Id: ERIERL-304

## Erts 10.2.4

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- When using the `{linger,{true,T}}` option; `gen_tcp:listen/2` used the full
  linger time before returning for example `eaddrinuse`. This bug has now been
  corrected.

  Own Id: OTP-14728 Aux Id: ERIERL-303

## Erts 10.2.3

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fix bug where doing a `gen_tcp:send` on a socket with `delay_send` set to true
  could cause a segfault if the other side closes the connection.

  Bug was introduced in erts-10.2 (OTP-21.2).

  Own Id: OTP-15536 Aux Id: ERL-827

- Fix a race condition when a port program closes that could result in the next
  started port to hang during startup.

  When this fault happens the following error is normally (but not always)
  logged:

  `=ERROR REPORT==== 14-Jan-2019::10:45:52.868246 ===`  
  `Bad input fd in erts_poll()! fd=11, port=#Port<0.505>, driver=spawn, name=/bin/sh -s unix:cmd`

  Own Id: OTP-15509 Aux Id: PR-2027, PR-2093

## Erts 10.2.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixed bug on big endian architectures when changing file permissions or
  ownership with `file:change_mode`, `change_owner`, `change_group` or
  `write_file_info`. Bug exists since OTP-21.0.

  Own Id: OTP-15485

- Fixed bug in `atomics` with option `{signed,false}` when returned values are
  `(1 bsl 63)` or larger. Could cause heap corruption leading to VM crash or
  other unpleasant symptoms. Bug exists since OTP-21.2 when module `atomics` was
  introduced.

  Own Id: OTP-15486 Aux Id: PR-2061

- Fixed bug in operator `band` of two negative operands causing erroneous result
  if the absolute value of one of the operands have the lowest `N*W` bits as
  zero and the other absolute value is not larger than `N*W` bits. `N` is an
  integer of 1 or larger and `W` is 32 or 64 depending on word size.

  Own Id: OTP-15487 Aux Id: ERL-804

## Erts 10.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- When a process was waiting for a TCP socket send operation to complete, and
  another process closed the socket during that send, the sending process could
  hang. This bug has now been corrected.

  Own Id: OTP-12242 Aux Id: ERL-561

- Document `bit_size` in match specifications and allow it in `ets:fun2ms`.

  Own Id: OTP-15343 Aux Id: PR-1962

- Fixed bug in `ets:select_replace` when called with a fully bound key could
  cause a following call to `ets:next` or `ets:prev` to crash the emulator or
  return invalid result.

  Own Id: OTP-15346

- When a module has been purged from memory, any literals belonging to that
  module will be copied to all processes that hold references to them. The max
  heap size limit would be ignored in the garbage collection initiated when
  copying literals to a process. If the max heap size was exceeded, the process
  would typically be terminated in the following garbage collection. Corrected
  to terminate the process directly if copying a literal would exceed the max
  heap size.

  Own Id: OTP-15360

- Fix compilation of run_erl on Solaris 11.4 and later.

  Own Id: OTP-15389

- Fixed a bug where `lists:reverse/1-2` could use far too many reductions. This
  bug was introduced in `OTP 21.1`.

  Own Id: OTP-15436

- Fixed a bug where a dirty scheduler could stay awake forever if a distribution
  entry was removed as part of a dirty GC.

  Own Id: OTP-15446 Aux Id: PR-2024

- Fix microstate accounting handing in various places. Most importantly the GC
  states when the GC is run on a dirty scheduler are now managed correctly.

  Own Id: OTP-15450 Aux Id: ERIERL-229

- Fixed bug in `file:sendfile` when the send operation failed. For sockets in
  `active` modes it could cause emulator crash or a hanging call. For sockets
  with `{active,false}` an unexpected `{inet_reply, _, _}` message could be sent
  to the calling process. The bug exists since OTP-21.0.

  Own Id: OTP-15461 Aux Id: ERL-784

- The erts configure script has been updated to reject any CFLAGS that does not
  have `-O`. This in order to prevent the common mistake of forgetting to add
  `-O2` to custom CFLAGS.

  Own Id: OTP-15465

- Fix reduction count in lists:member/2

  Own Id: OTP-15474 Aux Id: ERIERL-229

### Improvements and New Features

- New `counters` and `atomics` modules supplies access to highly efficient
  operations on mutable fixed word sized variables.

  Own Id: OTP-13468

- There is a new module `persistent_term` that implements a term storage
  suitable for terms that are frequently used but never or infrequently updated.
  Lookups are done in constant time without copying the terms.

  Own Id: OTP-14669 Aux Id: PR-1989

- A function `inet:getifaddrs/1` that takes a list with a namespace option has
  been added, for platforms that support that feature, for example Linux
  (only?).

  Own Id: OTP-15121 Aux Id: ERIERL-189, PR-1974

- Added the `nopush` option for TCP sockets, which corresponds to `TCP_NOPUSH`
  on \*BSD and `TCP_CORK` on Linux.

  This is also used internally in `file:sendfile` to reduce latency on
  subsequent send operations.

  Own Id: OTP-15357 Aux Id: ERL-698

- List subtraction (The `--` operator) will now yield properly on large inputs.

  Own Id: OTP-15371

- Optimize handling of send_delay for tcp sockes to better work with the new
  pollthread implementation introduced in OTP-21.

  Own Id: OTP-15471 Aux Id: ERIERL-229

- Optimize driver_set_timer with a zero timeout to short-circuit and not create
  any timer structure, but instead schedule the timer immediately.

  Own Id: OTP-15472 Aux Id: ERIERL-229

- Add `erl_xcomp_code_model_small` as a cross configure variable in order to let
  the emulator be build with the assumption that a small code model will be used
  on the target machine.

  Own Id: OTP-15473 Aux Id: ERIERL-229

- Add a new pollset that is made to handle sockets that use `{active, true}` or
  `{active, N}`. The new pollset will not be polled by a pollthread, but instead
  polled by a normal scheduler.

  This change was made because of the overhead associated with constantly having
  to re-apply the ONESHOT mechanism on fds that all input events were
  interesting.

  The new pollset is only active on platforms that support concurrent kernel
  poll updates, i.e. Linux and BSD.

  Own Id: OTP-15475 Aux Id: ERIERL-229

- Fix bug where emulator would segfault if a literal message was sent when
  sequence tracing was enabled.

  Own Id: OTP-15478 Aux Id: ERL-741

## Erts 10.1.3

### Improvements and New Features

- Added an optional `./configure` flag to compile the emulator with spectre
  mitigation: `--with-spectre-mitigation`

  Note that this requires a recent version of GCC with support for spectre
  mitigation and the `--mindirect-branch=thunk` flag, such as `8.1`.

  Own Id: OTP-15430 Aux Id: ERIERL-237

## Erts 10.1.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixed a rare bug where files could be closed on a normal instead of an IO

  Own Id: OTP-15333 Aux Id: ERL-737

## Erts 10.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fix the seq_trace token to not be cleared when a process receives messages
  sent by erts. Some examples of when this could happen is all port BIFs, i.e.
  `open_port`, `port_command` etc etc.

  Fix so that messages sent by nifs can be traced using normal and `seq_trace`
  tracing.

  Own Id: OTP-15038 Aux Id: ERL-602

- Fixed specs and documentation for `process_info` item `monitored_by` to
  include port identifiers and nif resources as possible types.

- Fix bug where ctrl-break or ctrl-c would not trigger the break mode properly
  on Windows. This bug was introduced in erts-10.0 (OTP-21).

  Own Id: OTP-15205

- Fix a performance bug for reception of UDP packages, where a memory buffer
  would be reallocated when it should not have been.

  Introduce a limit on the maximum automatic increase of the UDP user-space
  buffer to the theoretical max of the network PATH, i.e. 65535.

  Own Id: OTP-15206

- Fix alignment of erts allocator state internally in erts. With the improper
  alignment the emulator would refuse to start when compiled with clang on
  32-bit systems.

  Own Id: OTP-15208 Aux Id: PR-1897 ERL-677

- Fix bug where too many concurrent calls to
  `erlang:open_port({spawn,"cmd"},...)` would result in the emulator terminating
  with the reason "Failed to write to erl_child_setup: ". After this fix the
  `open_port` call will throw an `emfile` exception instead.

  Own Id: OTP-15210

- Upgraded the ERTS internal PCRE library from version 8.41 to version 8.42. See
  [http://pcre.org/original/changelog.txt](http://pcre.org/original/changelog.txt)
  for information about changes made to PCRE. This library implements major
  parts of the `m:re` regular expressions module.

  Own Id: OTP-15217

- Fix `open_port({fd,X,Y}, ...)` to release the file descriptors from the
  pollset when closing the port. Without this fix the same file descriptor
  number could not be reused when doing multiple open_port and port_close
  sequences.

  Own Id: OTP-15236 Aux Id: ERL-692

- Fixed bug in [`float_to_list/2`](`float_to_list/2`) and
  [`float_to_binary/2`](`float_to_binary/2`) with options
  `[{decimals,0},compact]` causing totally wrong results. Bug exists since
  OTP-21.0.

  Own Id: OTP-15276 Aux Id: PR-1920

- Fixed bug in `erlang:memory` causing `ets` to report too much. This small
  false memory leak (16 bytes each time) can only happen when a specific race
  condition occurs between scheduler threads on a table with option
  `write_concurrency`.

  Own Id: OTP-15278

- Minor `configure` test fixes

  Own Id: OTP-15282

- Improved robustness of distribution connection setup. In OTP-21.0 a truly
  asynchronous connection setup was introduced. This is further improvement on
  that work to make the emulator more robust and also be able to recover in
  cases when involved Erlang processes misbehave.

  Own Id: OTP-15297 Aux Id: OTP-15279, OTP-15280

### Improvements and New Features

- The socket options `recvtos`, `recvttl`, `recvtclass` and `pktoptions` have
  been implemented in the socket modules. See the documentation for the
  `gen_tcp`, `gen_udp` and `inet` modules. Note that support for these in the
  runtime system is platform dependent. Especially for `pktoptions` which is
  very Linux specific and obsoleted by the RFCs that defined it.

  Own Id: OTP-15145 Aux Id: ERIERL-187

## Erts 10.0.8

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- As of ERTS version 10.0 (OTP 21.0) the `erl_child_setup` program, which
  creates port programs, ignores `TERM` signals. This setting was
  unintentionally inherited by port programs. Handling of `TERM` signals in port
  programs has now been restored to the default behavior. That is, terminate the
  process.

  Own Id: OTP-15289 Aux Id: ERIERL-235, OTP-14943, ERL-576

- The fix made for OTP-15279 in erts-10.07 (OTP-21.0.8) was not complete. It
  could cause a new connection attempt to be incorrectly aborted in certain
  cases. This fix will amend that flaw.

  Own Id: OTP-15296 Aux Id: OTP-15279, ERIERL-226

## Erts 10.0.7

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- A process could get stuck in an infinite rescheduling loop between normal and
  dirty schedulers. This bug was introduced in ERTS version 10.0.

  Thanks to Maxim Fedorov for finding and fixing this issue.

  Own Id: OTP-15275 Aux Id: PR-1943

## Erts 10.0.6

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- A race between termination of a process and resume of the same process via
  `erlang:resume_process/1` could cause the VM to crash. This bug was introduced
  in erts version 10.0 (OTP 21.0).

  Own Id: OTP-15237

- When tracing on `running`, `in` trace events could be lost when a process was
  rescheduled between a dirty and a normal scheduler.

  Own Id: OTP-15269 Aux Id: ERL-713

## Erts 10.0.5

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixed a bug which caused an emulator crash when `enif_send()` was called by a
  NIF that executed on a dirty scheduler. The bug was either triggered when the
  NIF called `enif_send()` without a message environment, or when the process
  executing the NIF was `send` traced.

  Own Id: OTP-15223

- Fixed a bug causing some Erlang references to be inconsistently ordered. This
  could for example cause failure to look up certain elements with references as
  keys in search data structures. This bug was introduced in R13B02.

  Thanks to Simon Cornish for finding the bug and supplying a fix.

  in some cases arguments to primitive operations to be mixed up. Filenames
  containing null characters inside the filename are now _rejected_ and will
  cause primitive file operations to fail.

  Also environment variable operations used to accept
  [names](`t:os:env_var_name/0`) and [values](`t:os:env_var_value/0`) of
  environment variables containing null characters (integer value zero). This
  caused operations to silently produce erroneous results. Environment variable
  names and values containing null characters inside the name or value are now
  _rejected_ and will cause environment variable operations to fail.

  Primitive environment variable operations also used to accept the `$=`
  character in environment variable names causing various problems. `$=`
  characters in environment variable names are now also _rejected_.

  Also `os:cmd/1` now reject null characters inside its
  [command](`t:os:os_command/0`).

  `erlang:open_port/2` will also reject null characters inside the port name
  from now on.

- `os:putenv` and `os:getenv` no longer access the process environment directly
  and instead work on a thread-safe emulation. The only observable difference is
  that it's _not_ kept in sync with libc `getenv(3)` / `putenv(3)`, so those who
  relied on that behavior in drivers or NIFs will need to add manual
  synchronization.

  On Windows this means that you can no longer resolve DLL dependencies by
  modifying the `PATH` just before loading the driver/NIF. To make this less of
  a problem, the emulator now adds the target DLL's folder to the DLL search
  path.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-11694

- A new logging API is added to Erlang/OTP, see the `m:logger` manual page, and
  section [Logging](`e:kernel:logger_chapter.md`) in the Kernel User's Guide.

  Calls to `error_logger` are automatically redirected to the new API, and
  legacy error logger event handlers can still be used. It is, however,
  recommended to use the Logger API directly when writing new code.

  Notice the following potential incompatibilities:

  - Kernel configuration parameters `error_logger` still works, but is overruled
    if the default handler's output destination is configured with Kernel
    configuration parameter `logger`.

    In general, parameters for configuring error logger are overwritten by new
    parameters for configuring Logger.

  - The concept of SASL error logging is deprecated, meaning that by default the
    SASL application does not affect which log events are logged.

    By default, supervisor reports and crash reports are logged by the default
    Logger handler started by Kernel, and end up at the same destination
    (terminal or file) as other standard log event from Erlang/OTP.

    Progress reports are not logged by default, but can be enabled by setting
    the primary log level to info, for example with the Kernel configuration
    parameter `logger_level`.

    To obtain backwards compatibility with the SASL error logging functionality
    from earlier releases, set Kernel configuration parameter
    `logger_sasl_compatible` to `true`. This prevents the default Logger handler
    from logging any supervisor-, crash-, or progress reports. Instead, SASL
    adds a separate Logger handler during application start, which takes care of
    these log events. The SASL configuration parameters `sasl_error_logger` and
    `sasl_errlog_type` specify the destination (terminal or file) and severity
    level to log for these events.

  Since Logger is new in Erlang/OTP 21.0, we do reserve the right to introduce
  changes to the Logger API and functionality in patches following this release.
  These changes might or might not be backwards compatible with the initial
  version.

- `gen_sctp:connect_init/4` or rather connect in `inet_drv.c` for SCTP has been
  fixed to not check the write file descriptor for writeability after a connect,
  since for SCTP (SOCK_SEQPACKET) that property does not seem to be any kind of
  indicator for when a connect has finished. This fixes connects that the OS
  returned as "in progress" that was misinterpreted by `gen_sctp:connect_init`
  as failed.

- The file driver has been rewritten as a NIF, decreasing the latency of file
  operations. Notable incompatibilities are:

  - The `use_threads` option for `file:sendfile/5` no longer has any effect; we
    either use non-blocking `sendfile(2)` or fall back to `file:read` \+
    `gen_tcp:send`.
  - The file-specific DTrace probes have been removed. The same effect can be
    achieved with normal tracing together with the `nif__entry`/`nif__return`
    probes to track scheduling.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-14256

- The I/O polling functionality of erts has been re-written to better make use
  of the OSs polling mechanisms. This change means that erts will now always
  prefer to use a kernel-polling mechanism if possible. Also all of the I/O
  polling has been moved to dedicated threads instead of being placed in the
  scheduler loops.

  As a result of this, the `erl` options `+K` and `+secio` have been removed. It
  is still possible to disable kernel-poll, but it has to be done at compile
  time through the configure option `--disable-kernel-poll`.

  The new `erl` options [`+IOt`](erl_cmd.md#%2BIOt) and
  [`+IOp`](erl_cmd.md#%2BIOp) can be used to change how many IO poll threads and
  poll sets that erts should use. See their respective documentation for more
  details.

- Truly asynchronous auto-connect. Earlier, when `erlang:send` was aimed toward
  an unconnected node, the function would not return until the connection setup
  had completed (or failed). Now the function returns directly after the message
  has been enqueued and the connection setup started.

  The same applies to all distributed operations that may trigger auto-connect,
  i.e. `'!'`, `send`, `link`, `monitor`, `monitor_node`, [`exit/2`](`exit/2`)
  and `group_leader`.

  The interface for all these functions are unchanged as they do not return
  connection failures. The only exception is `erlang:monitor` where a _possible
  incompatibility_ is introduced: An attempt to monitor a process on a primitive
  node (such as erl_interface or jinterface), where remote process monitoring is
  not implemented, will no longer fail with `badarg` exception. Instead a
  monitor will be created, but it will only supervise the connection to the
  node.

- Changed the default behaviour of `.erlang` loading: `.erlang` is no longer
  loaded from the current directory. `c:erlangrc(PathList)` can be used to

- New functionality for implementation of alternative carriers for the Erlang
  distribution has been introduced. This mainly consists of support for usage of
  distribution controller processes (previously only ports could be used as
  distribution controllers). For more information see
  [ERTS User's Guide ➜ How to implement an Alternative Carrier for the Erlang Distribution ➜ Distribution Module](alt_dist.md#distribution-module).

- Add support for the lcc compiler and in extension the Elbrus 2000 platform.

  Own Id: OTP-14492

- Support for "tuple calls" have been removed from the run-time system. Tuple
  calls was an undocumented and unsupported feature which allowed the module
  argument for an apply operation to be a tuple: `Var = dict:new(), Var:size()`.
  This "feature" frequently caused confusion, especially when such call failed.
  The stacktrace would point out functions that don't exist in the source code.

  For legacy code that need to use parameterized modules or tuple calls for some
  other reason, there is a new compiler option called `tuple_calls`. When this
  option is given, the compiler will generate extra code that emulates the old
  behavior for calls where the module is a variable.

- Creation of small maps with literal keys has been optimized to be faster and

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-14508

- The non-smp emulators have been removed. This means that the configure options
  `--disable-threads` and `--enable-plain-emulator` have been removed and
  configure will now refuse to build Erlang/OTP on platforms without thread

  In order to achieve a similar setup as the non-smp emulator, it is possible to
  start Erlang/OTP with the `+S 1` option.

- When the value returned from a '`catch`' expression is ignored, no stacktrace
  will be built if an exception is caught. That will save time and produce less

  the compiler and run-time system.

  Own Id: OTP-14683

- The guarantees and non-guarantees of `erlang:get_stacktrace/0` are now

- The number of driver async threads will now default to 1 as the standard

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- The runtime system disconnected a connection if it received an
  [`exit/2`](`exit/2`) signal where the recipient was a process on an old
  incarnation of the current node. That is, the receiving node had the same node
  name, but another "creation" number. The signal will now just be dropped since
  the receiving process no longer exists.

- Fix a bug in `binary_to_term` that would crash the emulator if a term larger
  than 16GB was to be decoded.

  Own Id: OTP-16058 Aux Id: PR-2382

- When communicating with a simultaneously exiting port via the
  `erlang:port_*()` BIFs one could sometimes get stray `{Ref, What}` messages.
  Where `Ref` was a reference and `What` usually were the atom `badarg`.

## Erts 9.3.3.11

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixed a buffer overflow when
  [`binary_to_existing_atom/2`](`binary_to_existing_atom/2`) and
  `list_to_existing_atom/2` was used with the `latin1` encoding.

  Own Id: OTP-15819 Aux Id: ERL-944

## Erts 9.3.3.10

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixes of install/release phase in build system.

  - The source tree was modified when installing/releasing and/or applying a
    patch.
  - Some files were installed with wrong access rights.
  - If applying a patch (using `otp_patch_apply`) as another user (except root)
    than the user that built the source, the documentation was not properly
    updated.

  Own Id: OTP-15551

- Minor fixes for `make clean`.

  Own Id: OTP-15657

- Fixed a bug in all `ets:select*` and `ets:match*` functions that could in some
  rare cases lead to very poor performance.

  Own Id: OTP-15660 Aux Id: ERL-869

- Fix a possible deadlock when terminating the ERTS caused by a dirty scheduler
  not releasing it's run-queue lock when terminating.

  Own Id: OTP-15690 Aux Id: PR-2172

- Add missing documentation of new external tags `NEW_PID`, `NEW_PORT` and
  `NEWER_REFERENCE` introduced in OTP 19.

  These new tags are planned to be "activated" in OTP 23 when distribution
  capability flag `DFLAG_BIG_CREATION` becomes mandatory. Older nodes (>= 19)
  are able to decode these new tags and send them back to the new node. Nodes
  older than OTP 23 will however never encode their own local pids, ports and
  references using the new tags.

  Own Id: OTP-15766

## Erts 9.3.3.9

### Improvements and New Features

- Added an optional `./configure` flag to compile the emulator with spectre
  mitigation: `--with-spectre-mitigation`

  Note that this requires a recent version of GCC with support for spectre
  mitigation and the `--mindirect-branch=thunk` flag, such as `8.1`.

## Erts 9.3.3.7

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixed bug in operator `band` of two negative operands causing erroneous result
  if the absolute value of one of the operands have the lowest `N*W` bits as
  zero and the other absolute value is not larger than `N*W` bits. `N` is an
  integer of 1 or larger and `W` is 32 or 64 depending on word size.

  Own Id: OTP-15371

## Erts 9.3.3.5

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- ERTS internal trees of monitor structures could get into an inconsistent
  state. This could cause `'DOWN'` messages not to be delivered when they
  should, as well as delivery of `'DOWN'` messages that should not be delivered.

  This bug was introduced in ERTS version 9.0 (OTP 20.0) and was fixed in ERTS
  version 10.0 (OTP 21.0) due to a rewrite of the monitor code. That is, this
  bug only exist in the OTP 20 release.

- Fixed bug in `ets:select_replace` when called with a fully bound key could
  cause a following call to `ets:next` or `ets:prev` to crash the emulator or
  return invalid result.

  Own Id: OTP-15346

## Erts 9.3.3.3

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixed a bug which caused an emulator crash when `enif_send()` was called by a
  NIF that executed on a dirty scheduler. The bug was either triggered when the
  NIF called `enif_send()` without a message environment, or when the process
  executing the NIF was `send` traced.

  Own Id: OTP-15223

- Fixed a bug causing some Erlang references to be inconsistently ordered. This
  could for example cause failure to look up certain elements with references as
  keys in search data structures. This bug was introduced in R13B02.

  Thanks to Simon Cornish for finding the bug and supplying a fix.

  Own Id: OTP-15067 Aux Id: ERL-573

## Erts 9.3.3

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixed bug in `ets` that could cause VM crash if process A terminates after
  fixating a table and process B deletes the table at "the same time". The table
  fixation could be done with `ets:safe_fixtable` or if process A terminates in
  the middle of a long running `select` or `match` call.

## Erts 9.3

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixed a `configure` test for `libz` internals that unintentionally caused
  various native code in OTP to link against `libz`. Under certain circumstances
  this caused the build of OTP to fail.

- Fix HiPE bug for binary constructs like `<<X/utf8>>` which could in rare cases
  cause faulty results or VM crash.

  This fix affects both the `hipe` compiler and `erts` runtime in an

- Fixed bug in [`float_to_list/2`](`float_to_list/2`) and
  [`float_to_binary/2`](`float_to_binary/2`) with option `decimals` that caused
  a faulty rounding up of the last decimal digit for about 6% of floats with a
  fraction part.

  For example, [`float_to_list(0.145, [{decimals,1}])`](`float_to_list/2`)
  returned `"0.2"` instead of `"0.1"`.

- Improve search algorithm of abandoned memory carriers. Instead of limited
  linear search, each allocator instance maintain a balanced search tree of all
  its abandoned carriers for faster and more exhaustive search.

  Own Id: OTP-14915 Aux Id: ERIERL-88

- New erts_alloc command line options `+M_acnl` and `+M_acfml` to limit carrier
  abandonment.

  Own Id: OTP-14916 Aux Id: ERIERL-88

- New family of `erts_alloc` strategies: Age Order First Fit. Similar to
  "address order", but instead the oldest possible carrier is always chosen for
  allocation.

  Own Id: OTP-14917 Aux Id: ERIERL-88

- Add possibility to change allocator options at runtime with
  `system_info(erts_alloc, ...)`. Only option `sbct` (single block carrier

## Erts 9.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fix a bug in tracing where the \{caller\} match spec function would be set to
  undefined incorrectly when used in conjunction with return_to or return_trace
  on some functions.

  The functions effected are: erlang:put/2, erlang:erase/1,
  erlang:process_info/1,2, erlang:nif_load/2, erts_internal:garbage_collection/1
  and erts_internal:check_process_code/1.

  Because of this bug, the analysis done by fprof could become incorrect when
  the functions above are the tail-call in a function.

  Own Id: OTP-14677

- Fix emulator deadlock that would happen if `trap_exit` was set to true and a

  [`exit(self(), Reason)`](`exit/2`) while receive tracing was enabled for that
  process.

  Own Id: OTP-14678 Aux Id: ERL-495

- Writing of crash dumps is significantly faster.

  Maps are now included in crash dumps.

  Constants terms would only be shown in one process, while other processes

  Corrected.

  Own Id: OTP-14791

- Setting the size of the atom table to a number near 2147483647 (using the
  '`+t`' option) would cause the emulator to exit with a failure to allocate a
  huge amount of memory. This has been corrected. Also the usage message for the
  '`+t`' option has been corrected to show the correct upper limit 2147483647
  instead of 0.

## Erts 9.1.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- The new zlib module returned a data_error when inflating concatenated streams,
  which was incompatible with the old module's behavior of returning the
  uncompressed data up to the end of the first stream.

  Own Id: OTP-14648

- zlib:gunzip/1 will no longer stop at the end of the first stream when
  decompressing concatenated gzip files.

  parts of the `m:re` regular expressions module.

  Own Id: OTP-14574

- Fixed a bug causing [`statistics(runtime)`](`statistics/1`) to produce
  negative values and a bug in [`statistics(wall_clock)`](`statistics/1`)
  causing it to produce values one second too long.

  [`statistics(runtime)`](`statistics/1`) now also use `getrusage()` as source
  when available preventing the returned value from wrapping as frequent as

  Own Id: OTP-14614 Aux Id: ERL-453

### Improvements and New Features

- Lock counting can now be fully toggled at runtime in the lock counting
  emulator (`-emu_type lcnt`). Everything is enabled by default to match the old
  behavior, but specific categories can be toggled at will with minimal runtime
  overhead when disabled. Refer to the documentation on `lcnt:rt_mask/1` for
  details.

  Own Id: OTP-13170

- The `zlib` module has been refactored and all its operations will now yield
  appropriately, allowing them to be used freely in concurrent applications.

  The following functions have been deprecated, but will not produce compiler
  warnings until OTP 21: `zlib:adler32`, `zlib:crc32`, `zlib:inflateChunk`,
  `zlib:getBufSize`, `zlib:setBufSize`.

  The behavior of throwing an error when a dictionary is required for
  decompression has also been deprecated. Refer to the documentation on
  `inflateSetDictionary/2` for details.

  Own Id: OTP-14185

- `lcnt:collect` and `lcnt:clear` will no longer block all other threads in the
  runtime system.

  Own Id: OTP-14412

- Add `erlang:iolist_to_iovec/1`, which converts an iolist() to an
  erlang:iovec(), which suitable for use with `enif_inspect_iovec`.

  Own Id: OTP-14520

- When provided with bad arguments, the `zlib` module will now raise named
  exceptions instead of just `badarg`. For example, `not_initialized` when using
  `zlib:inflate/2` with an uninitialized stream.

  Own Id: OTP-14527

- `erlang:halt/2` allows any Unicode string as slogan for the crash dump.

  Own Id: OTP-14553

## Erts 9.0.4

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- A timer internal bit-field used for storing scheduler id was too small. As a
  result, VM internal timer data structures could become inconsistent when using
  1024 schedulers on the system. Note that systems with less than 1024
  schedulers are not effected by this bug.

  This bug was introduced in ERTS version 7.0 (OTP 18.0).

  Own Id: OTP-14548 Aux Id: OTP-11997, ERL-468

- Automatic cleanup of a BIF timer, when the owner process terminated, could
  race with the timeout of the timer. This could cause the VM internal data

- Fixed segfault that could happen during cleanup of aborted
  erlang:port_command/3 calls. A port_command is aborted if the port is closed
  at the same time as the port_command was issued. This bug was introduced in
  erts-8.0.

  Own Id: OTP-14481

- Fixed implementation of [`statistics(wall_clock)`](`statistics/1`) and
  [`statistics(runtime)`](`statistics/1`) so that values do not unnecessarily
  wrap due to the emulator. Note that the values returned by
  [`statistics(runtime)`](`statistics/1`) may still wrap due to limitations in
  the underlying functionality provided by the operating system.

  Own Id: OTP-14484

- Fix performance bug in pre-allocators that could cause them to permanently
  fall back on normal more expensive memory allocation. Pre-allocators are used
  for quick allocation of short lived meta data used by messages and other
  scheduled tasks. Bug exists since OTP_R15B02. \[this release note was missing
  in erts-9.0.1]

  Own Id: OTP-14491

## Erts 9.0

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fix various bugs regarding loading, upgrade and purge of HiPE compiled code:

  - The native code memory for a purged module was never deallocated.
  - Wrong functions could in some cases be called after a module upgrade.
  - `erlang:check_process_code` did not check for recursive calls made from
    native code.

  Own Id: OTP-13968

- Hipe optional LLVM backend does require LLVM version 3.9 or later as older
  versions forced strong dependencies on erts internals structures.

  Own Id: OTP-14238

- When an exception such as '[`throw(HugeTerm)`](`throw/1`)' was caught,
  `HugeTerm` term would be kept in the process until the next exception
  occurred, potentially increasing the heap size for the process. That has been
  corrected.

  Own Id: OTP-14255 Aux Id: OTP-14400, OTP-14401

- Slogans in crash dumps have been extended to print more complex terms.

  Own Id: OTP-14303

- Fix 'epmd -kill' to return a failure exit status code if epmd was not killed
  because of some error.

  Own Id: OTP-14324

- Fixed the following dirty scheduler related bugs:

  - the `+SDPcpu` command line argument could cause the amount of dirty CPU
    schedulers to be set to zero
  - `erlang:system_flag(multi_scheduling, _)` failed when only one normal
    scheduler was used together with dirty scheduler support

- Fix erlexec to handle mismatch in sysconf and proc fs when figuring out the
  cpu topology. This behaviour has been seen when using docker together with
  `--cpuset-cpus`.

### Improvements and New Features

- Added `erlang:garbage_collect/2` that takes an option list as the last
  argument that can be used to control whether a minor or a major garbage
  collection is to be done. Doing a minor collection only collects terms that
  have recently died, but is cheaper than a major collection.

  Own Id: OTP-11695

- Optimized test for tuples with an atom as first element.

  Own Id: OTP-12148

- Erlang literals are no longer copied during process to process messaging.

  Own Id: OTP-13529

- Add support in the `erl_nif` API for asynchronous message notifications when
  sockets or other file descriptors are ready to accept read or write
  operations. The following functions have been added:

  - enif_select
  - enif_monitor_process
  - enif_demonitor_process
  - enif_compare_monitors
  - enif_open_resource_type_x

  Own Id: OTP-13684

- There are two new guard BIFs '[`floor/1`](`floor/1`)' and
  '[`ceil/1`](`ceil/1`)'. They both return integers. In the '`math`' module,
  there are two new BIFs with the same names that return floating point values.

  Own Id: OTP-13692

- Remove deprecated `erlang:hash/2`.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-13827

- Replaced usage of deprecated symbolic [`time unit`](`t:erlang:time_unit/0`)
  representations.

  Own Id: OTP-13831 Aux Id: OTP-13735

- Added support in zlib for extraction of the inflation dictionary.

  Own Id: OTP-13842

- The previously used purge strategy has been removed. The optional purge
  strategy introduced in ERTS version 8.1 is now the only strategy available.

  The new purge strategy is slightly incompatible with the old strategy.
  Previously processes holding `fun`s that referred to the module being purged
  either failed a soft purge, or was killed during a hard purge. The new
  strategy completely ignores `fun`s. If `fun`s referring to the code being
  purged exist, and are used after a purge, an exception will be raised upon
  usage. That is, the behavior will be exactly the same as the case when a `fun`
  is received by a process after the purge.

  For more information see the documentation of `erlang:check_process_code/3`.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-13844 Aux Id: OTP-13833

- Dirty schedulers are now enabled by default when the runtime system is built
  with SMP support.

  Own Id: OTP-13860

- Improved ETS lookup/insert/delete speed for large `set`, `bag` and
  `duplicate_bag` by a significant reduction of the hash load factor. This speed
  improvement comes at the expense of less than one word per table entry. Tables
  with less than 256 entries are not affected at all.

  Own Id: OTP-13903

- The NIF library `reload` feature is not supported anymore. It has been marked
  as deprecated since OTP R15B. This means that you are only allowed to do one
  successful call to `erlang:load_nif/2` for each module instance. A second call
  to `erlang:load_nif/2` will return `{error, {reload, _}}` even if the NIF
  library implements the `reload` callback.

  Runtime upgrade of a NIF library is still supported by using the Erlang module
  upgrade mechanics with a current and an old module instance existing at the
  same time with their corresponding NIF libraries.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-13908

- Add `erlang:system_info(atom_count)` and `erlang:system_info(atom_limit)` to
  provide a way to retrieve the current and maximum number of atoms.

  Own Id: OTP-13976

- The function `fmod/2` has been added to the `math` module.

  Own Id: OTP-14000

- `erlang:load_nif/2` returns new error type `notsup` when called for a HiPE
  compiled module, which is not supported.

  Own Id: OTP-14002

- Add driver and nif lock instrumentation to lcnt

  Own Id: OTP-14069

- Reduce memory pressure by converting sub-binaries to heap-binaries when
  possible. This is done during garbage collection.

  Own Id: OTP-14149

- Dirty schedulers are now enabled and supported on Erlang runtime systems with
  SMP support.

  Besides support for dirty NIFs also support for dirty BIFs and dirty garbage
  collection have been introduced. All garbage collections that potentially will
  take a long time to complete are now performed on dirty schedulers if enabled.

  `erlang:statistics/1` with arguments inspecting scheduler and run queue states
  have been changed due to the dirty scheduler support. Code using this
  functionality may have to be rewritten taking these incompatibilities into
  consideration. Examples of such uses are calls to
  [`erlang:statistics(scheduler_wall_time)`](`m:erlang#statistics_scheduler_wall_time`),
  [`statistics(total_run_queue_lengths)`](`m:erlang#statistics_total_run_queue_lengths`),
  [`statistics(total_active_tasks)`](`m:erlang#statistics_total_active_tasks`),
  etc.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-14152

- Atoms may now contain arbitrary Unicode characters.

  Own Id: OTP-14178

- Introduce an event manager in Erlang to handle OS signals. A subset of OS
  signals may be subscribed to and those are described in the Kernel
  application.

  Own Id: OTP-14186

- The `escript` program now handles symbolic links to escripts.

  This is useful for standalone systems with `escript`s residing on a bin
  directory not included in the execution path (as it may cause their `erl`
  program(s) to override the desired one). Instead the `escript`s can be
  referred to via symbolic links from a bin directory in the path.

  Own Id: OTP-14201 Aux Id: PR-1293

- All uses of the magic binary kludge has been replaced by uses of erlang
  references.

  A magic binary was presented as an empty binary, but actually referred other
  data internally in the Erlang VM. Since they were presented as empty binaries,
  different magic binaries compared as equal, and also lost their internal data
  when passed out of an erlang node.

  The new usage of references has not got any of these strange semantic issues,
  and the usage of these references has been optimized to give the same
  performance benefits as well as memory usage benefits as magic binaries had.

  A couple of examples of previous uses of magic binaries are match
  specifications and NIF resources.

  Own Id: OTP-14205

- The non-smp emulators have been deprecated and are scheduled for removal in
  OTP-21.

  In preparation for this, the threaded non-smp emulator is no longer built by
  default and has to be enabled using the --enable-plain-emulator to configure.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-14272

- Allow HiPE to run on VM built with `--enable-m32-build`.

  Own Id: OTP-14330 Aux Id: PR-1397

- Upgraded the OTP internal PCRE library from version 8.33 to version 8.40. This
  library is used for implementation of the `m:re` regular expressions module.

  Besides various bug fixes, the new version allows for better stack protection.
  In order to utilize this feature, the stack size of normal scheduler threads
  is now by default set to 128 kilo words on all platforms. The stack size of
  normal scheduler threads can be set upon system start by passing the
  [`+sss`](erl_cmd.md#sched_thread_stack_size) command line argument to the
  [`erl`](erl_cmd.md) command.

  See
  [http://pcre.org/original/changelog.txt](http://pcre.org/original/changelog.txt)
  for information about changes made to PCRE between the versions 8.33 and 8.40.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-14331 Aux Id: ERL-208

- Remove generation of atoms in old latin1 external format in the distribution
  between erlang nodes, `erl_interface`, and `jinterface`. The new utf8 format
  for atoms was introduced in OTP R16. An OTP 20 node can therefore not connect
  to nodes older than R16.

  Atoms that can be encoded using latin1 are still encoded by `term_to_binary()`
  using latin1 encoding. Note that all atoms will by default be encoded using
  utf8 in a future Erlang/OTP release. For more information see the
  documentation of `erlang:term_to_binary/2`.

  Own Id: OTP-14337

- Added function `re:version/0` which returns information about the OTP internal
  PCRE version used for implementation of the `re` module.

- Various improvements of timer management internally in the VM. These
  improvements both reduced memory consumption of timer wheels as well as reduce
  the amount of work that has to be performed in order to handle timers.

  Own Id: OTP-14356

- Sockets can now be bound to device (SO_BINDTODEVICE) on platforms where it is
  supported.

  This has been implemented e.g to support VRF-Lite under Linux; see
  [VRF ](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/vrf.txt), and
  GitHub pull request [\#1326](https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/1326).

  Own Id: OTP-14357 Aux Id: PR-1326

- Added the following [`erl`](erl_cmd.md) command line arguments with which you
  can set suggested stack for dirty schedulers:

  - **[`+sssdcpu`](erl_cmd.md#dcpu_sched_thread_stack_size)** - for dirty CPU
    schedulers

  - **[`+sssdio`](erl_cmd.md#dio_sched_thread_stack_size)** - for dirty IO
    schedulers

  The default suggested stack size for dirty schedulers is 40 kilo words.

  Own Id: OTP-14380

- Changed erts startup program name, argv 0, to use the environment variable
  `ESCRIPT_NAME` so that `erlc`, `dialyzer`, `typer`, `ct_run`, or the escript
  name can be seen with external programs, such as ps and htop (depending on
  options), on unix.

- '`./configure --enable-lock-counter`' will enabling building of an additional
  emulator that has support for lock counting. (The option previously existed,
  but would turn on lock counting in the default emulator being built.) To start
  the lock-counting emulator, use '`erl -emu_type lcnt`'.

  On Windows, `erl` recognized the undocumented option `-debug` for starting a
  debug-compiled emulator. That option has been removed. Use
  '`erl -emu_type debug`' instead.

  Own Id: OTP-14407

- Warnings have been added to the relevant documentation about not using
  un-secure distributed nodes in exposed environments.

  erts-8.0.

  Own Id: OTP-14481

- Fixed implementation of [`statistics(wall_clock)`](`statistics/1`) and
  [`statistics(runtime)`](`statistics/1`) so that values do not unnecessarily
  wrap due to the emulator. Note that the values returned by
  [`statistics(runtime)`](`statistics/1`) may still wrap due to limitations in
  the underlying functionality provided by the operating system.

  Own Id: OTP-14451

## Erts 8.3.4

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Add option to make SIGTERM trigger the OS default behaviour instead of doing a
  graceful shutdown. To activate this bahviour the environment variable
  ERL_ZZ_SIGTERM_KILL should be set to "true". This option only works in OTP 19
  as OTP 20 will have a different way to deal with SIGTERM.

- A slight improvement of `erlang:get_stacktrace/0` for exceptions raised in
  hipe compiled code. Beam compiled functions in such stack trace was earlier
  replaced by some unrelated function. They are now instead omitted. This is an
  attempt to reduce the confusion in the absence of a complete and correct stack
  trace for mixed beam and hipe functions.

- Faulty arguments could be presented on exception from a NIF that had
  rescheduled itself using `enif_schedule_nif()`.

- The runtime system could crash if a garbage collection on a process was
  performed immediately after a NIF had been rescheduled using
  `enif_schedule_nif()`.

  Own Id: OTP-14049

- A reference to purged code could be left undetected by the purge operation if
  a process just had rescheduled a NIF call using `enif_schedule_nif()` when the
  process was checked. This could cause a runtime system crash.

  Own Id: OTP-14050

- Fixed a number of dirty scheduler related bugs:

  - Process priority was not handled correct when scheduling on a dirty
    scheduler.
  - The runtime system could crash when an exit signal with a compound exit
    reason was sent to a process executing on a dirty scheduler.
  - The runtime system crashed when call tracing a process executing on a dirty
    scheduler.
  - A code purge operation could end up hanging forever when a process executed
    on a dirty scheduler

### Improvements and New Features

- Fix minor soft purge race bug that could incorrectly trigger code_server to
  load new code for the module if the soft purge failed and no current version
  of the module existed.

  Own Id: OTP-13925

- To ease troubleshooting, `erlang:load_nif/2` now includes the return value
  from a failed call to load/reload/upgrade in the text part of the error tuple.
  The `crypto` NIF makes use of this feature by returning the source line
  where/if the initialization fails.

  Own Id: OTP-13951

- New environment variable `ERL_CRASH_DUMP_BYTES` can be used to limit the size
  of crash dumps. If the limit is reached, crash dump generation is aborted and
  the generated file will be truncated.

## Erts 8.1.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- The emulator got a dynamic library dependency towards libsctp, which on Linux
  was not intended since the emulator there loads and resolves the needed sctp
  functions in runtime. This has been fixed and a configure switch
  --enable-sctp=lib has been added for those who want such a library dependency.

- Fix SIGUSR1 crashdump generation

  Do not generate a core when a crashdump is asked for.

  Own Id: OTP-13997

- The new functions in `code` that allows loading of many modules at once had a
  performance problem. While executing a helper function in the
  `erl_prim_loader` process, garbage messages were produced. The garbages
  messages were ignored and ultimately discarded, but there would be a negative
  impact on performance and memory usage. The number of garbage message depended
  on both the number of modules to be loaded and the length of the code path.

  The functions affected of this problem were: `atomic_load/1`,
  `ensure_modules_loaded/1`, and `prepare_loading/1`.

### Improvements and New Features

- Improved accuracy of timeouts on MacOS X. This by setting premature timeouts
  followed by a short actual timeout during scheduler wait.

  Own Id: OTP-13698

- Added the following symbolic time unit representations to the
  `t:erlang:time_unit/0` type:

  - `second`
  - `millisecond`
  - `microsecond`
  - `nanosecond`

  The following symbolic time unit representations are now _deprecated_, but
  still part of the [`erlang:time_unit()`](`t:erlang:time_unit/0`) type:

  - `seconds`
  - `milli_seconds`
  - `micro_seconds`
  - `nano_seconds`

  Own Id: OTP-13735

- Fix maps hashing entropy of maps with maps keys.

  Own Id: OTP-13763 Aux Id: ERL-199

- Improved dirty scheduler support. A purge of a module can now be performed
  without having to wait for completion of all ongoing dirty NIF calls.

  Note that when enabling support for dirty schedulers, a new purge strategy
  will as of ERTS version 8.1 be enabled. This new strategy is not fully
  backwards compatible with the strategy used by default. For more information
  see the documentation of `erlang:check_process_code/3`.

  Own Id: OTP-13808 Aux Id: OTP-13833

- A new purge strategy has been introduced. The new strategy will by default be
  disabled during the OTP 19 release, but will be the only strategy available as
  of the OTP 20 release.

  The new strategy is slightly incompatible with the strategy being used by
  default in OTP 19. Using the default strategy, processes holding `fun`s that
  refer to the module being purged either fail a soft purge, or will be killed
  during a hard purge. The new strategy completely ignores `fun`s. If `fun`s
  referring to the code being purged exist, and are used after a purge, an
  exception will be raised upon usage. That is, the behavior will be exactly the
  same as the case when a `fun` is received by a process after the purge.

  The new strategy can optionally be enabled when building OTP during OTP 19,
  and will automatically be enabled if the runtime system is built with support
  for dirty schedulers.

  For more information see the documentation of `erlang:check_process_code/3`.

  remote group leader. This bug was introduced in ERTS version 8.0.

  Own Id: OTP-13716

## Erts 8.0

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- The handling of `on_load` functions has been improved. The major improvement
  is that if a code upgrade fails because the `on_load` function fails, the
  previous version of the module will now be retained.

  Own Id: OTP-12593

- `is_builtin(erlang, apply, 3)` will now return `true`.

  Own Id: OTP-13034

  would be killed by a SIGUSR2 signal when creating a crash dump.

  Own Id: OTP-13425

- Fix race between [`process_flag(trap_exit,true)`](`process_flag/2`) and a
  received exit signal.

  A process could terminate due to exit signal even though
  [`process_flag(trap_exit,true)`](`process_flag/2`) had returned. A very
  specific timing between call to [`process_flag/2`](`process_flag/2`) and exit
  signal from another scheduler was required for this to happen.

  Own Id: OTP-13452

- Don't search for non-existing Map keys twice

  For `maps:get/2,3` and `maps:find/2`, searching for an immediate key, e.g. an
  atom, in a small map, the search was performed twice if the key did not exist.

- Update configure scripts to not use hard-coded path for /bin/pwd and /bin/rm.

  Own Id: OTP-13562

- When passing a larger binary than the outputv callback of a linked-in driver
  can handle in one io vector slot, the binary is now split into multiple slots
  in the io vector. This change only effects system where the max size of an io
  vector slot is smaller then the word size of the system (e.g. Windows).

  This change means that it is now possible on Windows to send binaries that are
  larger than 4GB to port_command, which is what is used for file:write,
  gen_tcp:send etc.

  Own Id: OTP-13628

- Workaround of Maps output in crashdumps. Currently the atom 'undefined' is
  generated instead of Map data if a Map type is encountered during crash.

  Own Id: OTP-13657

### Improvements and New Features

- The tracing support has been extended to allow a
  [tracer module](`m:erl_tracer`) to be the trace event handler instead of a
  process or port. The [tracer module](`m:erl_tracer`) makes it possible for
  trace tools to filter or manipulate trace event data without the trace event
  first having to be copied from the traced process or port.

  With the introduction of this feature, `erlang:trace(all|existing, _, _)` now
  also returns the tracer process as part of the number of processes on which
  tracing is enabled. The is incompatible with the previous releases.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-10267

- Introduce LTTng tracing of Erlang Runtime System

  For LTTng to be enabled OTP needs to be built with configure option
  `--with-dynamic-trace=lttng`.

  This feature introduces tracepoints for schedulers, drivers, memory carriers,
  memory and async thread pool.

  For a list of all tracepoints, see
  [Runtime Tools User's Guide](`e:runtime_tools:lttng.md`) .

  Own Id: OTP-10282

- Make it possible to monitor/demonitor ports using the `erlang:monitor/2` API.
  The process and port information functions have also been updated to include
  information about monitors from processes to ports.

  Own Id: OTP-11384

- Add microstate accounting

  Microstate accounting is a way to track which state the different threads
  within ERTS are in. The main usage area is to pin point performance
  bottlenecks by checking which states the threads are in and then from there
  figuring out why and where to optimize.

  Since checking whether microstate accounting is on or off is relatively
  expensive only a few of the states are enabled by default and more states can
  be enabled through configure.

  There is a convenience module called msacc that has been added to
  runtime_tools that can assist in gathering and interpreting the data from
  Microstate accounting.

  For more information see
  [erlang:statistics(microstate*accounting, *)](`m:erlang#statistics_microstate_accounting`)
  and the `m:msacc` module in runtime_tools.

  Own Id: OTP-12345

- The port of Erlang/OTP to the real-time operating system OSE has been removed.

  Own Id: OTP-12573

- Sharing preserved copy for messages and exit signals

  Enable sharing preserved copy with configure option
  `--enable-sharing-preserving`. This will preserve sharing, within the process,
  when communication with other processes in the Erlang node. There is a
  trade-off, the copy is more costly but this cost can be reclaimed if there is
  a lot of sharing in the message. In addition literals will not be copied in a
  send except during a purge phase of the module where the literals are located.
  This feature is considered experimental in 19.0.

  Own Id: OTP-12590 Aux Id: OTP-10251

- Halfword BEAM has been removed.

  Own Id: OTP-12883

- Added `os:perf_counter/1`.

  The perf_counter is a very very cheap and high resolution timer that can be
  used to timestamp system events. It does not have monoticity guarantees, but
  should on most OS's expose a monotonous time.

  Own Id: OTP-12908

- Support for a fragmented young heap generation. That is, the young heap
  generation can consist of multiple non continuous memory areas. The main
  reason for this change is to avoid extra copying of messages that could not be
  allocated directly on the receivers heap.

  Own Id: OTP-13047

- Erlang linked-in driver can now force the call to open_port to block until a
  call to erl_drv_init_ack is made inside the driver. This is useful when you
  want to do some asynchronous initialization, for example getting configuration
  from a pipe, and you want the initial open_port call to fail if the
  configuration is incomplete or wrong. See the erl_driver documentation for
  more details on the API.

  Own Id: OTP-13086

- Erlang linked-in drivers can now set their own pids as seen in
  `erlang:port_info/1` by using the `erl_drv_set_pid` function. For more details
  see the erl_driver documentation.

  Own Id: OTP-13087

- The functionality behind `erlang:open_port/2` when called with spawn or
  spawn_executable has been redone so that the forking of the new program is
  done in a separate process called erl_child_setup. This allows for a much more
  robust implementation that uses less memory and does not block the entire
  emulator if the program to be started is on an un-accessible NFS. Benchmarks
  have shown this approach to be about 3-5 times as fast as the old approach
  where the fork/vfork was done by erts. This is a pure stability and
  performance fix, however some error messages may have changed, which is why it
  is marked as a backwards incompatible change.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-13088

- Improved yielding strategy in the implementation of the following native
  functions:

  - `erlang:binary_to_list/1`
  - `erlang:binary_to_list/3`
  - `erlang:bitstring_to_list/1`
  - `erlang:list_to_binary/1`
  - `erlang:iolist_to_binary/1`
  - `erlang:list_to_bitstring/1`
  - `binary:list_to_bin/1`

  This in order to improve performance of these functions.

  Own Id: OTP-13096

- All garbage collections of processes now bump reductions. Also the amount of
  reductions bumped when garbage collecting has been adjusted. It now better
  corresponds to the amount of work performed. This in order to improve the real
  time characteristics of the system.

  Own Id: OTP-13097

- New functions that can load multiple modules at once have been added to the
  '`code`' module. The functions are `code:atomic_load/1`,
  `code:prepare_loading/1`, `code:finish_loading/1`, and
  `code:ensure_modules_loaded/1`.

  Own Id: OTP-13111

- The `-boot_var` option for `erl` now only supports a single key and single
  value (as documented). The option used to allow multiple key/value pairs, but
  that behavior was undocumented.

  The function `erl_prim_loader:start/3` has been removed. Its documentation has
  also been removed.

  The undocumented and unsupported function `erl_prim_loader:get_files/2` has
  been removed.

  Own Id: OTP-13112

- Low level BIF `erlang:purge_module/1` is made more robust against incorrect
  use. Lingering processes that still refer the old code are now killed before
  the module is purged to prevent fatal VM behavior.

  Own Id: OTP-13122

- Improved dirty scheduler implementation. For more information see the
  [NIF documentation](erl_nif.md#dirty_nifs).

  > #### Note {: .info }
  >
  > - The dirty scheduler support is still _experimental_.
  > - The support for determining whether dirty NIF support exist or not at
  >   compile time using the C preprocessor macro
  >   `ERL_NIF_DIRTY_SCHEDULER_SUPPORT` has been removed.
  > - The `enif_is_on_dirty_scheduler()` function has been removed. Use
  >   [`enif_thread_type()`](erl_nif.md#enif_thread_type) instead.

  Own Id: OTP-13123

- Various optimizations done to process dictionary access.

  Own Id: OTP-13167

- The functions `erlang:list_to_integer/1` and `string:to_integer/1` have been
  optimized for large inputs.

  Own Id: OTP-13293

- Improved memory allocation strategy for hipe native code on x86_64 (amd64)
  architectures by reserving enough low virtual address space needed for the
  HiPE/AMD64 small code model. The default virtual address area for hipe code is
  set to 512Mb, but can be changed with emulator flag `+MXscs`.

  Own Id: OTP-13359

- Introduction of configurable management of data referred to by the message
  queue of a process. Each process can be configured individually.

  It is now possible to configure the message queue of a process, so that all
  data referred by it will be kept outside of the heap, and by this prevent this
  data from being part of garbage collections.

  For more information see the documentation of
  [`process_flag(message_queue_data, MQD)`](`m:erlang#process_flag_message_queue_data`).

  Own Id: OTP-13366 Aux Id: OTP-13047

- Processes now yield when scanning large message queues and not finding a
  matching message. This in order to improve real time characteristics.

  Own Id: OTP-13401

- Optimized an erts internal function that is used to traverse erlang terms. The
  internal function was mainly used by term_to_binary and comparison of terms.
  Benchmarks have shown up to a 10% performance increase in those functions
  after the optimization.

  Own Id: OTP-13440

- Add the following NIF API functions:

  - [`enif_cpu_time`](erl_nif.md#enif_cpu_time)
  - [`enif_now_time`](erl_nif.md#enif_now_time)
  - [`enif_make_unique_integer`](erl_nif.md#enif_make_unique_integer)

  a new list while checking for properness.

  Own Id: OTP-13487

- Handle terms (pids,ports and refs) from nodes with a 'creation' value larger
  than 3. This is a preparation of the distribution protocol to allow OTP 19
  nodes to correctly communicate with future nodes (20 or higher). The
  'creation' value differentiates different incarnations of the same node
  (name).

  Own Id: OTP-13488

- Don't send unasked for systemd notifications in epmd

  Own Id: OTP-13493 Aux Id: PR-999

- The enif_send API has been extended to allow NULL to be used as the message
  environment. When used this way, a message environment is implicitly created
  and the given term is copied into that environment before sending. This can be
  an optimization if many small messages are being sent by the nif.

  Own Id: OTP-13495

- The tracing support has been extended to allow tracing on ports. Ports can be
  traced on using the 'ports', 'send' and 'receive' trace flags.

  The first argument of `erlang:trace/3` has been extended so that `'all'`,
  `'existing'` and `'new'` now include both processes and ports. New `Tracee`
  variants, `'all_processes'`, `'all_ports'`, `'existing_processes'` etc have
  been added to specify only processes or ports.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-13496

- When the `'procs'` trace flag is enabled, a `'spawned'` trace event is now
  also generated by a newly created process. The previous event `'spawn'`
  remains, but as it is generated by the process that did the spawn, it is not
  guaranteed that it is ordered with other trace events from the newly spawned
  process. So when tracking the lifetime of a process this new event should be
  used as the creation event.

  This new trace event is marked as an incompatibility because tools that expect
  certain trace events when enabling 'procs' will have to updated.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-13497

- Add the `erlang:match_spec_test/3` function. The functions allows the testing
  of match specifications for both tracing and ets tables. It can be used to
  test that a match specification does the expected filtering on specific data.
  It also returns more verbose error reasons for incorrectly constructed match
  specifications.

  Own Id: OTP-13501

- The erts internal tracing support has been changed to have much less overhead
  and be more scalable.

  This rewrite does not break any backwards incompatibilities, but it does
  change the ordering of some trace messages when compared to previous releases.
  It should be noted that this only applies to trace messages sent to processes
  or ports, it does not apply to the new tracer module. However in future
  releases they may also be effected by this.

  Trace messages are only guaranteed to be ordered from one traced process or
  port. In previous releases this was not visible as a `'send'` trace message
  would always arrive before the corresponding `'receive'` trace message that is
  no longer always the case. This also means that timestamped trace messages may
  seem to arrive out of order as the timestamp is taken when the event is
  triggered and not when it is put in the queue of the tracer.

- Add possibility to filter `send` and `receive` trace with match
  specifications.

  Own Id: OTP-13507

- Add `maps:update_with/3,4` and `maps:take/2`

  Own Id: OTP-13522 Aux Id: PR-1025

- Introduce LTTng tracing via Erlang tracing.

  For LTTng to be enabled OTP needs to be built with configure option
  `--with-dynamic-trace=lttng`.

  The dynamic trace module `dyntrace` is now capable to be used as a LTTng sink
  for Erlang tracing. For a list of all tracepoints, see
  [Runtime Tools User's Guide](`e:runtime_tools:lttng.md`) .

  This feature also introduces an incompatible change in trace tags. The trace
  tags `gc_start` and `gc_end` has been split into `gc_minor_start`,
  `gc_minor_end` and `gc_major_start`, `gc_major_end`.

- Add enif_snprintf to the NIF API

  The function `enif_snprintf` is similar to `snprintf` call but can handle
  formatting of Erlang terms via `%T` format specifier.

- A timer internal bit-field used for storing scheduler id was too small. As a
  result, VM internal timer data structures could become inconsistent when using

  Own Id: OTP-13420

- A process communicating with a port via one of the `erlang:port_*` BIFs could
  potentially end up in an inconsistent state if the port terminated during the
  communication. When this occurred the process could later block in a `receive`

- Fix race between [`process_flag(trap_exit,true)`](`process_flag/2`) and a
  received exit signal.

  A process could terminate due to exit signal even though
  [`process_flag(trap_exit,true)`](`process_flag/2`) had returned. A very
  specific timing between call to [`process_flag/2`](`process_flag/2`) and exit
  signal from another scheduler was required for this to happen.

## Erts 7.3

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- The '-path' flag to 'erl' has been documented. This flag replaces the path
  specified in the boot script. It has always existed, but was earlier only
  documented in SASL (script).

  Own Id: OTP-13060

- The `call_time` tracing functionality internally used a time based on OS
  system time in order to measure call time which could cause erroneous results
  if OS system time was changed during tracing.

  This functionality now use Erlang monotonic time in order to measure time.
  Besides fixing the erroneous results due to OS system time being used, the
  results are often also better since Erlang monotonic time often has better
  accuracy and precision.

- Fix bug in `erlang:halt/1,2` for large exit status values, causing either
  `badarg` (on 32-bit) or exit with a crash dump and/or core dump (on 64-bit).

  truncate high order bits if the OS does not support it.

  Own Id: OTP-13251 Aux Id: ERL-49

- `gen_tcp:accept/2` was not
  [time warp safe](time_correction.md#time-warp-safe-code). This since it used

  fixed.

  Own Id: OTP-13298 Aux Id: OTP-11388

- A workaround for an issue with older gcc versions (less than 5) and inline
  assembly on 32-bit x86 caused an emulator crash when it had been compiled with
  a newer gcc version. An improved `configure` test, run when building OTP, now
  detects whether the workaround should be used or not.

  Own Id: OTP-13326 Aux Id: ERL-80

  Own Id: OTP-13201

- Time warp safety improvements.

  Introduced the options `monotonic_timestamp`, and `strict_monotonic_timestamp`
  to the trace, sequential trace, and system profile functionality. This since
  the already existing `timestamp` option is not time warp safe.

  Introduced the option `safe_fixed_monotonic_time` to `ets:info/2` and
  `dets:info/2`. This since the already existing `safe_fixed` option is not time
  warp safe.

- The runtime system on various posix platforms (except for Linux and Solaris)
  could crash when large amounts of file-descriptors were in use.

  Own Id: OTP-12954

- A beam file compiled by hipe for an incompatible runtime system was sometimes

  Own Id: OTP-12989

### Improvements and New Features

- Changed default clock source used for OS system time on MacOS X to
  `gettimeofday()` in order to improve performance. The system can be configured
  during build to use the previously used higher resolution clock source by
  passing the switch
  [`--with-clock-resolution=high`](`e:system:install.md#advanced-configuration-and-build-of-erlang-otp_configuring`)
  when configuring the build.

  Own Id: OTP-12945 Aux Id: OTP-12892

- Added the `configure` option
  [`--disable-saved-compile-time`](`e:system:install.md#advanced-configuration-and-build-of-erlang-otp_configuring`)

## Erts 7.0.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- A process could end up in an inconsistent half exited state in the runtime
  system without SMP support. This could occur if the processes was traced by a
  port that it also was linked to, and the port terminated abnormally while
  handling a trace message for the process.

  This bug has always existed in the runtime system without SMP support, but
  never in the runtime system with SMP support.

  Own Id: OTP-12889 Aux Id: seq12885

- Removed unnecessary copying of data when retrieving corrected Erlang monotonic
  time.

  Own Id: OTP-12894

- Changed default OS monotonic clock source chosen at build time. This in order
  to improve performance. The behavior will now on most systems be that (both OS
  and Erlang) monotonic time stops when the system is suspended.

  If you prefer that monotonic time elapse during suspend of the machine, you
  can pass the command line argument
  `--enable-prefer-elapsed-monotonic-time-during-suspend` to `configure` when
  building Erlang/OTP. The configuration stage will try to find such a clock
  source, but might not be able to find it. Note that there might be a
  performance penalty associated with such a clock source.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-12895

- `erlang:system_info(end_time)` returned a faulty value on 32-bit
  architectures.

  Own Id: OTP-12896

### Improvements and New Features

- The `configure` command line argument
  `--enable-gettimeofday-as-os-system-time` has been added which force usage of
  `gettimeofday()` for OS system time. This will improve performance of
  `os:system_time()` and `os:timestamp()` on MacOS X, at the expense of worse
  accuracy, resolution and precision of Erlang monotonic time, Erlang system
  time, and OS system time.

## Erts 7.0

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fix issuing with spaces and quoting in the arguments when using

- Fix global call trace when hipe compiled code call beam compiled functions.
  Tracing of beam functions should now always work regardless who the caller is.

  Own Id: OTP-11939

- Correct cache alignment for ETS `write_concurrency` locks to improve
  performance by reduced false sharing. May increase memory footprint for tables
  with `write_concurrency`.

  Own Id: OTP-11974

- All possibly blocking operations in the fd/spawn and terminal driver have been
  converted to non-blocking operations. Before this fix it was possible for the
  VM to be blocked for a long time if the entity consuming stdout/stderr did not
  consume it fast enough.

  Own Id: OTP-12239

- Add missing overhead for offheap binaries created from external format. This
  fix can improve the garbage collection of large binaries originating from
  `binary_to_term` or messages from remote nodes.

  Own Id: OTP-12554

- Ensure hashing of zero is consistent

  Erlang treats positive and negative zero as equal:

  `true = 0.0 =:= 0.0/-1`

  However, Erlangs hash functions: hash, phash and phash2 did not reflect this
  behaviour. The hash values produced by the different hash functions would not
  be identical for positive and negative zero.

  This change ensures that hash value of positive zero is always produced
  regardless of the signedness of the zero float, i.e.,

  `true = erlang:phash2(0.0) =:= erlang:phash2(0.0/-1)`

  Own Id: OTP-12641

- Ensure NIF term creation disallows illegal floating point values and too long
  atoms. Such values will cause a NIF to throw badarg exception when it returns.

  Own Id: OTP-12655

- Fixed building of Map results from match_specs

  A faulty "box-value" entered into the heap which could cause a segmentation
  fault in the garbage collector if it was written on a heap fragment.

  Own Id: OTP-12656

- Fix hipe bug when matching a "writable" binary. The bug has been seen to

  Own Id: OTP-12820

- Fix garbage collection of literals in code purge

  During code purging and check_process_code, the checking of the binary

- Debug function `erlang:display/1` shows content of binaries and bitstrings,
  not only the length.

  Own Id: OTP-11941

- The time functionality of Erlang has been extended. This both includes a
  [new API](time_correction.md#new-time-api) for time, as well as
  [time warp modes](time_correction.md#time-warp-modes) which alters the
  behavior of the system when system time changes. _You are strongly encouraged
  to use the new API_ instead of the old API based on `erlang:now/0`.
  `erlang:now/0` has been deprecated since it is and forever will be a
  scalability bottleneck. For more information see the
  [Time and Time Correction](time_correction.md) chapter of the ERTS User's
  Guide.

  Besides the API changes and time warp modes a lot of scalability and
  performance improvements regarding time management has been made internally in
  the runtime system. Examples of such improvements are scheduler specific timer
  wheels, scheduler specific BIF timer management, parallel retrieval of
  monotonic time and system time on systems with primitives that are not buggy.

    operations.
  - A slightly reduced priority of externally triggered I/O operations.

- Improved usage of `gcc`'s builtins for atomic memory access. These are used
  when no other implementation of atomic memory operations is available. For
  example, when compiling for ARM when `libatomic_ops` is not available.

  The largest improvement will be seen when compiling with a `gcc` with support
  for the `__atomic_*` builtins (using a `gcc` of at least version 4.7), but
  also when only the legacy `__sync_*` builtins are available (using a `gcc` of
  at least version 4.1) an improvement can be seen.

  For more information see the
  "[Atomic Memory Operations and the VM](`e:system:install.md#advanced-configuration-and-build-of-erlang-otp_configuring_atomic-memory-operations-and-the-vm`)"

- The documentation of the Abstract Format (in the ERTS User's Guide) has been
  updated with types and specification. (Thanks to Anthony Ramine.)

  The explicit representation of parentheses used in types of the abstract

  inserting parentheses where needed.

- Use persistent hashmaps for large Maps

  Maps will use a persistent hashmap implementation when the number of pairs in
  a Map becomes sufficiently large. The change will occur when a Map reaches 33
  pairs in size but this limit might change in the future.

  The most significant impact for the user by this change is speed, and to a
  lesser degree memory consumption and introspection of Maps. Memory consumption
  size is probalistic but lesser than `gb_trees` or `dict` for instance. Any
  other impacts will be transparent for the user except for the following
  changes.

  Semantics of Maps have changed in two incompatible ways compared to the
  experimental implementation in OTP 17:

  - Hashing of maps is done different by `erlang:phash2/1,2`, `erlang:phash/1`
    and `erlang:hash/2`.
  - Comparing two maps with ==, /=, =<, <, >= and >, is done different if the
    keys contain floating point numbers.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-12585

- Scalability improvement for `erlang:make_ref/0`, and other functionality that
  create references. Each scheduler now manage its own set of references. By
  this no communication at all is needed when creating references.

  Previous implementation generated a strictly monotonically increasing sequence
  of references corresponding to creation time on the runtime system instance.
  This is _not_ the case with current implementation. You can only expect
  reference to be unique. The Erlang/OTP documentation has never mentioned
  anything else but the uniqueness property, so this change _is_ fully
  compatible. The only reason we've marked this as a potential incompatibility
  is since an early draft for an Erlang specification mentions strict
  monotonicity as a property.

  If you need to create data with a strict monotonicity property use
  [erlang:unique_integer(\[monotonic])](`erlang:unique_integer/1`). Do _not_ use
  the deprecated [erlang:now()](`erlang:now/0`).

- Enable different abort signal from heart

  By using environment variable HEART_KILL_SIGNAL, heart can now use a different

- Update autconf to latest version 2015-03-04

  Own Id: OTP-12646

- Optimization of timers internally in the VM. This include process timers
  (`receive ... after`), port timers (`driver_set_timer()`) as well as BIF
  timers (`erlang:send_after()`/`erlang:start_timer()`).

  Each scheduler thread now has its own lock-free timer service instead of one
  locked central service. This dramatically improves performance of timer
  management on systems with a large amount of schedulers and timers.

  The timer service internal data structure has also been optimized to be able
  to handle more timers than before. That is, each timer service is by its self
  able to handle more timers without dramatic performance loss than the old
  centralized timer service.

  The API of BIF timers has also been extended. Timeout values are for example
  no longer limited to 32-bit integers. For more information see the
  documentation of `erlang:start_timer/4`, `erlang:send_after/4`,
  `erlang:cancel_timer/2`, and `erlang:read_timer/2`.

  Characteristics impact: Calls to the synchronous versions of
  `erlang:cancel_timer()`, and `erlang:read_timer()` may take substantially
  longer time to complete than before. This occur when the timer that is
  accessed is managed by a remote scheduler. You typically want to use the new
  asynchronous option in order to avoid blocking the calling process.

- Specialize instructions from common assembler patterns

  Specialize common instructions of `rem`, `band`, `minus` and `plus` in the
  beam loader. This will reduce the number of fetches and thus lessen the
  instruction dispatch pressure during runtime and speed up those operations in
  some common cases.

  Specialize move patterns from x-registers to the stack with a new
  `move_window` instruction. This change will reduce instruction dispatch
  pressure.

- gen_tcp:shutdown/2 is now asynchronous

  This solves the following problems with the old implementation:

  It doesn't block when the TCP peer is idle or slow. This is the expected
  behaviour when shutdown() is called: the caller needs to be able to continue
  reading from the socket, not be prevented from doing so.

  It doesn't truncate the output. The current version of gen_tcp:shutdown/2 will
  truncate any outbound data in the driver queue after about 10 seconds if the
  TCP peer is idle of slow. Worse yet, it doesn't even inform anyone that the
  data has been truncated: 'ok' is returned to the caller; and a FIN rather than
  an RST is sent to the TCP peer.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-12797

- Introduced delayed node table GC. This in order to avoid oscillation of
  entries in and out of the tables. The oscillation caused unnecessary lock
  contention on the table locks. The delay length can be set by passing the
  [`+zdntgc`](erl_cmd.md#%2Bzdntgc) command line argument.

  Characteristics impact: The tables can grow to very large sizes with unused
  entries if the node is get huge amounts of short lived connections from other
  nodes. This problem can be alleviated by shortening the length of the delay
  using the `+zdntgc` command line argument.

  Own Id: OTP-12802

- Improved implementation of [`erlang:statistics`](`erlang:statistics/1`)`(io)`

- There are many cases where user code needs to be able to distinguish between a

- A process communicating with a port via one of the `erlang:port_*` BIFs could
  potentially end up in an inconsistent state if the port terminated during the

- Fix getifaddrs realloc pointer error

  When a buffer was exhausted and subsequently reallocated, we could get an

  For this to occur we would need to have a large number of interfaces and a

  The symptom would be garbage returned from erlang:port_control(Port, 25, [])
  (prim_inet:getifaddrs(Port) resulting in a badarg) or a segmentation fault.

- Don't close all file descriptors twice in child_setup

  The commit c2b4eab25c907f453a394d382c04cd04e6c06b49 introduced an error in
  which child_setup erroneously tried to close all file descriptors twice.

  Use closefrom() if available when closing all file descriptors.

  The function closefrom() was only used in the vfork() case before but is now
  also used in the fork() case if available.

  Own Id: OTP-12446

- During a crashdump all file descriptors are closed to ensure the closing of
  the epmd port and to reserve a file descriptor for the crashdump file.

  If a driver (third party library) cannot handle closing of sockets this could
  result in a segmentation fault in which case a crashdump would not be
  produced. This is now fixed by only closing inets sockets via an emergency
  close callback to the driver and thus closing the epmd socket.

### Improvements and New Features

- Introduced support for eager check I/O.

  By default eager check I/O will be disabled, but this will most likely be
  changed in OTP 18. When eager check I/O is enabled, schedulers will more
  frequently check for I/O work. Outstanding I/O operations will however not be
  prioritized to the same extent as when eager check I/O is disabled.

  Eager check I/O can be enabled using the `erl` command line argument:
  `+secio true`

  Characteristics impact when enabled:

  - Lower latency and smoother management of externally triggered I/O
    operations.
  - A slightly reduced priority of externally triggered I/O operations.

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- General documentation updates.

  Own Id: OTP-12052

- A bug in the VM code implementing sending of signals to ports could cause the
  receiving port queue to remain in a busy state forever. When this state had
  been reached, processes sending command signals to the port either got
  suspended forever, or, if the `nosuspend` feature was used, always failed to
  send to the port. This bug was introduced in ERTS version 5.10.

  In order for this bug to be triggered on a port, one had to at least once
  utilize the `nosuspend` functionality when passing a signal to the port. This
  by either calling

  - [`port_command(Port, Data, [nosuspend | Options])`](`erlang:port_command/3`),
  - [`erlang:send(Port, {PortOwner, {command, Data}}, [nosuspend | Options])`](`erlang:send/3`),
  - [`erlang:send_nosuspend(Port, {PortOwner, {command, Data}})`](`erlang:send_nosuspend/2`),
    or
  - [`erlang:send_nosuspend(Port, {PortOwner, {command, Data}}, Options)`](`erlang:send_nosuspend/3`).

### Improvements and New Features

- Add log2 histogram to lcnt for lock wait time

  Own Id: OTP-12059

- Introduced [`enif_schedule_nif()`](erl_nif.md#enif_schedule_nif) to the NIF
  API.

  The `enif_schedule_nif()` function allows a long-running NIF to be broken into
  separate NIF invocations without the help of a wrapper function written in
  Erlang. The NIF first executes part of the long-running task, then calls
  `enif_schedule_nif()` to schedule a NIF for later execution to continue the
  task. Any number of NIFs can be scheduled in this manner, one after another.
  Since the emulator regains control between invocations, this helps avoid
  problems caused by native code tying up scheduler threads for too long.

  The `enif_schedule_nif()` function also replaces the

## Erts 6.1.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- OTP-11850 fixed filelib:wildcard/1 to work with broken symlinks. This
  correction, however, introduced problems since symlinks were no longer
  followed for functions like filelib:ensure_dir/1, filelib:is_dir/1,
  filelib:file_size/1, etc. This is now corrected.

  `large_heap` was ever sent on non-smp VM. Bug exist since R16B.

  Own Id: OTP-11852

- The emulator without SMP support crashed when passing a message to a process
  without enough heap space for the message. This bug was introduced in
  `erts-6.0`.

- Fix race between ETS table deletion and unfixation that could cause VM crash.
  The race could happen between a terminating process that does not own the
  table but has a fixation on it and another process that deletes the table
  (maybe the owner terminating) at the same time. Bug existed since R15B02.

  Own Id: OTP-11892

- The string following the `-eval` option when invoking `erl` would not be
  properly translated from UTF-8 to a list of Unicode characters (as would the
  arguments for `-run`).

  That bug would cause the build of Erlang/OTP to fail when building in a
  directory whose pathname contained non-US ASCII characters encoded in UTF-8.

- Fixed a bug where `send` trace events were erroneously dropped when the send
  was done to a registered process. This bug was introduced in R16B.

  Own Id: OTP-11968

### Improvements and New Features

- The following native functions now bump an appropriate amount of reductions
  and yield when out of reductions:

  - `erlang:binary_to_list/1`
  - `erlang:binary_to_list/3`
  - `erlang:bitstring_to_list/1`
  - `erlang:list_to_binary/1`
  - `erlang:iolist_to_binary/1`
  - `erlang:list_to_bitstring/1`
  - `binary:list_to_bin/1`

  Characteristics impact:

  - **Performance** - The functions converting from lists got a performance loss
    for very small lists, and a performance gain for very large lists.

  - **Priority** - Previously a process executing one of these functions
    effectively got an unfair priority boost. This priority boost depended on
    the input size. The larger the input was, the larger the priority boost got.
    This unfair priority boost is now lost.

  Own Id: OTP-11888

- The systemd features of epmd have been removed from epmd by default. To enable
  them you have to build erlang with the configure option --enable-systemd.

  Own Id: OTP-11921

- Removed Erlang wrapper code used when calling
  [`binary_to_term/1`](`binary_to_term/1`), and
  [`binary_to_term/2`](`binary_to_term/2`). This improves the performance of
  these BIFs especially when they are called with small binaries as input.

## Erts 6.0

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- The option dupnames did not work as intended in re. When looking for names
  with \{capture, \[Name, ...]\}, re:run returned a random instance of the match
  for that name, instead of the leftmost matching instance, which was what the
  documentation stated. This is now corrected to adhere to the documentation.
  The option \{capture,all_names\} along with a re:inspect/2 function is also
  added to further help in using named subpatterns.

  Own Id: OTP-11565

- Correction of the examples in escript documentation. (Thanks to Pierre
  Fenoll).

  Own Id: OTP-11577

- Fix bs_get_integer instruction

  The instruction bs_get_integer could unnecessarily trigger a garbage
  collection in failure cases which is unwanted or outright dangerous.

  Ex:

  <<X:Sz,\_/bits>> = <<"some binary">>

  Previously, if Sz induced X to a bignum it would reserved memory size this on
  the heap via a garbage collection before checking if the size could actually
  match.

  It will now check the binary size before triggering a collection.

  Own Id: OTP-11581

- Remove heap space overestimation in `binary_to_term` (and remote message
  reception) for integers in the intervals \[-2147483648,-1] and

- Fixed bug where sendfile would return the wrong error code for a remotely
  closed socket if the socket was in passive mode. (Thanks to Vincent Siliakus
  for reporting the bug.)

  Own Id: OTP-11614

- Increase garbage collection tenure rate

  The garbage collector tries to maintain the previous heap block size during a
  minor gc, i.e. 'need' is not utilized in determining the size of the new heap,
  instead it relies on tenure and garbage to be sufficiently large.

  In instances during intense growing with exclusively live data on the heap
  coupled with delayed tenure, fullsweeps would be triggered directly after a
  minor gc to make room for 'need' since the new heap would be full.

  To remedy this, the tenure of terms on the minor heap will always happen (if
  it is below the high watermark) instead of every other minor gc.

  Characteristics Impact: Reduced CPU-time spent in garbage collection but may
  infer delays in collecting garbage from the heap. Tweak 'fullsweep_after'
  options to increase gc pressure if needed.

- sendfile no longer uses async threads by default

  This has been done because a slow client attack is possible if the async
  thread pool is used. The scenario is:

  Client does a request for a file and then slowly receives the file one byte at
  a time. This will eventually fill the async thread pool with blocking sendfile
  operations and thus starving the vm of all file operations.

  If you still want to use the async threads pool for sendfile an option to
  enable it has been introduced.

  Thanks to Christopher Faulet for identifying this vulnerability.

  callbacks of NIF library return failure.

  Own Id: OTP-11722

- Changed the default configuration when configuring with `$ERL_TOP/configure`
  to be the same as when configuring with `$ERL_TOP/otp_build configure`.

  Previously floating point exceptions got enabled by default on Linux when HiPE
  was enabled when configuring with `$ERL_TOP/configure`, but not when
  configuring with `$ERL_TOP/otp_build configure`. The default is now in both
  cases not to use floating point exceptions since there still exist unresolved
  issues with floating point exceptions on Linux.

### Improvements and New Features

- Options to set match_limit and match_limit_recursion are added to re:run. The
  option report_errors is also added to get more information when re:run fails
  due to limits or compilation errors.

  Own Id: OTP-10285

- Dialyzer's `unmatched_return` warnings have been corrected.

  Own Id: OTP-10908

- A common case is to wrap an argument to
  [`list_to_binary/1`](`list_to_binary/1`) in a list to ensure conversion can
  happen even though the argument may already be a binary. Take special care of
  this case and do not copy binary.

  Impact: May cause incompatibility since a single binary is no longer copied.
  Use `binary:copy/1,2` instead.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-11082

- Make erlang:open_port/2 spawn and spawn_executable handle unicode.

  Own Id: OTP-11135

- The version of the PCRE library Used by Erlang's re module is raised to 8.33
  from 7.6. This means, among other things, better Unicode and Unicode Character
  Properties support. New options connected to PCRE 8.33 are also added to the
  re module (ucd, notempty_atstart, no_start_optimize). PCRE has extended the
  regular expression syntax between 7.6 and 8.33, why this imposes a potential
  incompatibility. Only very complicated regular expressions may be affected,
  but if you know you are using obscure features, please test run your regular
  expressions and verify that their behavior has not changed.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-11204

- Filenames containing UTF-8 encoded characters can now be handled by erlc.

  If you have set the `ERLC_EMULATOR` environment variable, note that `erlc` in
  OTP 17 will only work with `erl` in OTP 17 since the protocol between the
  `erlc` program and the `erl_compile` module has changed.

  Own Id: OTP-11248

- By giving --enable-static-\{nifs,drivers\} to configure it is now possible to
  statically linking of nifs and drivers to the main Erlang VM binary. At the
  moment only the asn1 and crypto nifs of the Erlang/OTP nifs and drivers have
  been prepared to be statically linked. For more details see the Installation
  Guide in the System documentation.

- Erlang/OTP has been ported to the realtime operating system OSE. The port
  supports both smp and non-smp emulator. For details around the port and how to
  started see the User's Guide in the _ose_ application.

  Note that not all parts of Erlang/OTP has been ported.

  Notable things that work are: non-smp and smp emulators, OSE signal
  interaction, crypto, asn1, run_erl/to_erl, tcp, epmd, distribution and most if
  not all non-os specific functionality of Erlang.

  Notable things that does not work are: udp/sctp, os_mon, erl_interface,
  binding of schedulers.

  Own Id: OTP-11334

- Add the \{active,N\} socket option for TCP, UDP, and SCTP, where N is an
  integer in the range -32768..32767, to allow a caller to specify the number of
  data messages to be delivered to the controlling process. Once the socket's
  delivered message count either reaches 0 or is explicitly set to 0 with
  inet:setopts/2 or by including \{active,0\} as an option when the socket is
  created, the socket transitions to passive (\{active, false\}) mode and the
  socket's controlling process receives a message to inform it of the
  transition. TCP sockets receive \{tcp_passive,Socket\}, UDP sockets receive
  \{udp_passive,Socket\} and SCTP sockets receive \{sctp_passive,Socket\}.

  The socket's delivered message counter defaults to 0, but it can be set using
  \{active,N\} via any gen_tcp, gen_udp, or gen_sctp function that takes socket
  options as arguments, or via inet:setopts/2. New N values are added to the
  socket's current counter value, and negative numbers can be used to reduce the
  counter value. Specifying a number that would cause the socket's counter value
  to go above 32767 causes an einval error. If a negative number is specified
  such that the counter value would become negative, the socket's counter value
  is set to 0 and the socket transitions to passive mode. If the counter value
  is already 0 and inet:setopts(Socket, \[\{active,0\}]) is specified, the
  counter value remains at 0 but the appropriate passive mode transition message
  is generated for the socket.

  Own Id: OTP-11368

- A new optional scheduler utilization balancing mechanism has been introduced.
  For more information see the [`+sub`](erl_cmd.md#%2Bsub) command line
  argument.

  Characteristics impact: None, when not enabled. When enabled, changed timing
  in the system, normally a small overhead due to measuring of utilization and
  calculating balancing information. On some systems, such as old Windows
  systems, the overhead can be quite substantial. This time measurement overhead
  highly depend on the underlying primitives provided by the OS.

  Own Id: OTP-11385

- A call to either the [`garbage_collect/1`](`garbage_collect/1`) BIF or the
  [`check_process_code/2`](`check_process_code/2`) BIF may trigger garbage
  collection of another processes than the process calling the BIF. The previous
  implementations performed these kinds of garbage collections without
  considering the internal state of the process being garbage collected. In
  order to be able to more easily and more efficiently implement yielding native
  code, these types of garbage collections have been rewritten. A garbage
  collection like this is now triggered by an asynchronous request signal, the
  actual garbage collection is performed by the process being garbage collected
  itself, and finalized by a reply signal to the process issuing the request.
  Using this approach processes can disable garbage collection and yield without
  having to set up the heap in a state that can be garbage collected.

  The [`garbage_collect/2`](`erlang:garbage_collect/2`), and
  [`check_process_code/3`](`erlang:check_process_code/3`) BIFs have been
  introduced. Both taking an option list as last argument. Using these, one can
  issue asynchronous requests.

  `code:purge/1` and `code:soft_purge/1` have been rewritten to utilize
  asynchronous `check_process_code` requests in order to parallelize work.

  Characteristics impact: A call to the
  [`garbage_collect/1`](`garbage_collect/1`) BIF or the
  [`check_process_code/2`](`check_process_code/2`) BIF will normally take longer
  time to complete while the system as a whole won't be as much negatively
  effected by the operation as before. A call to `code:purge/1` and
  `code:soft_purge/1` may complete faster or slower depending on the state of
  the system while the system as a whole won't be as much negatively effected by
  the operation as before.

- Cleanup 'Buckets' and 'Time left' fields in crashdump to ease parsing.

  Own Id: OTP-11419

- Add sync option to file:open/2.

  The sync option adds the POSIX O_SYNC flag to the open system call on
  platforms that support the flag or its equivalent, e.g.,
  FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH on Windows. For platforms that don't support it,
  file:open/2 returns \{error, enotsup\} if the sync option is passed in. Thank
  to Steve Vinoski and Joseph Blomstedt

  Own Id: OTP-11498

- erlang:binary_to_term will now cost an appropriate amount of reductions and
  will interrupt (yield) for reschedule if the term is big. This avoids too long
  schedules when binary_to_term is used. (Thanks to Svante Karlsson for the
  original patch)

  Impact: Programs running binary_to_term on large binaries will run more
  smoothly, but rescheduling will impact the single process performance of the
  BIF. Single threaded benchmarks might show degraded performance of the BIF,
  while general system behaviour will be improved.

- Migration of memory carriers has been enabled by default on all ERTS internal
  memory allocators based on the [`alloc_util`](erts_alloc.md#alloc_util)
  framework except for `temp_alloc`. That is,
  [`+M<S>acul de`](erts_alloc.md#M_acul) is default for these allocators. Note
  that this also implies changed allocation strategies for all of these
  allocators. They will all now use the "address order first fit carrier best
  fit" strategy.

  By passing `+Muacul 0` on the command line, all configuration changes made by
  this change will be reverted.

  Characteristics impact: Improved memory characteristics with a smaller memory
  footprint at the expense of a quite small performance cost.

  For information on how to use Maps please see Map Expressions in the
  [Reference Manual](`e:system:expressions.md#map-expressions`).

  The current implementation is without the following features:

- Experimental "dirty scheduler" functionality has been introduced. In order to
  try the functionality out, you need to pass the command line argument
  `--enable-dirty-schedulers` to `configure` when building the system.

  Dirty schedulers can currently only be used by NIFs on a system with SMP
  support. More information can be found in the
  [`erl_nif(3)`](erl_nif.md#dirty_nifs) documentation, the
  [`erl(1)`](erl_cmd.md) documentation, and in the git commit comment of commit
  'c1c03ae4ee50e58b7669ea88ec4d29c6b2b67c7b'.

  Note that the functionality is _experimental_, and _not supported_. This
  functionality _will_ be subject to backward incompatible changes. You should
  _not_ enable the dirty scheduler functionality on production systems. It is
  only provided for testing.

  Thanks to Steve Vinoski.

- A new memory allocation feature called "super carrier" has been introduced.
  The super carrier feature can be used in different ways. It can for example be
  used for pre-allocation of all memory that the runtime system should be able
  to use.

  By default the super carrier is disabled. It is enabled by passing the
  [`+MMscs <size in MB>`](erts_alloc.md#MMscs) command line argument. For more
  information see the documentation of the [`+MMsco`](erts_alloc.md#MMsco),
  [`+MMscrfsd`](erts_alloc.md#MMscrfsd), [`+MMscrpm`](erts_alloc.md#MMscrpm),
  [`+MMscs`](erts_alloc.md#MMscs), [`+MMusac`](erts_alloc.md#Musac), and,
  [`+Mlpm`](erts_alloc.md#Mlpm) command line arguments in the
  [`erts_alloc(3)`](erts_alloc.md) documentation.

  Since it is disabled by default there should be no impact on system
  characteristics if not used.

  This change has been marked as a potential incompatibility since the returned
  list when calling
  [`erlang:system_info({allocator, mseg_alloc})`](`m:erlang#system_info_allocator_tuple`)
  now also include an `{erts_mmap, _}` tuple as one element in the list.

- Add new BIF os:unsetenv/1 which deletes an environment variable. Thanks to
  Martin Hässler.

  Own Id: OTP-11446

- Introduced a new guarantee regarding exit signals from ports:

  If the process calling one of the synchronous port BIFs listed below is linked
  to the port identified by the first argument, and the port exits before
  sending the result of the port operation, the exit signal issued due to this
  link will be received by the processes before the BIF returns, or fail with an
  exception due to the port not being open.

  The synchronous port BIFs are:

  - [`port_close/1`](`erlang:port_close/1`)
  - [`port_command/2`](`erlang:port_command/2`)
  - [`port_command/3`](`erlang:port_command/3`)
  - [`port_connect/2`](`erlang:port_connect/2`)
  - [`port_control/3`](`erlang:port_control/3`)
  - `erlang:port_call/3`
  - `erlang:port_info/1`
  - `erlang:port_info/2`

  Note that some ports under certain circumstances unlink themselves from the
  calling process before exiting, i.e. even though the process linked itself to
  the port there might be no link triggering an exit signal.

  Characteristics impact: The return or exception from the synchronous port BIF
  will be delayed if the port simultaneously exit due to some issue unrelated to
  the outstanding synchronous port BIF call. In all other cases characteristics
  are unchanged.

## Erts 5.10.3.1

### Improvements and New Features

- Memory allocators will be able to create `sys_alloc` carriers as fallback, if
  `mseg_alloc` cannot create more carriers, on systems with `posix_memalign()`
  support. This is similar to how it worked in pre-R16 releases.

  Windows systems will create carriers using `_aligned_malloc()` and can by this
  use the new optimized allocator header scheme introduced in R16 on other
  platforms.

- Export type zlib:zstream/0. Thanks to Loic Hoguin.

  Own Id: OTP-11278

- Add erl option to set schedulers by percentages.

  For applications where measurements show enhanced performance from the use of
  a non-default number of emulator scheduler threads, having to accurately set
  the right number of scheduler threads across multiple hosts each with
  different numbers of logical processors is difficult because the erl +S option
  requires absolute numbers of scheduler threads and scheduler threads online to
  be specified.

  To address this issue, add a +SP option to erl, similar to the existing +S
  option but allowing the number of scheduler threads and scheduler threads
  online to be set as percentages of logical processors configured and logical
  processors available, respectively. For example, "+SP 50:25" sets the number
  of scheduler threads to 50% of the logical processors configured, and the
  number of scheduler threads online to 25% of the logical processors available.
  The +SP option also interacts with any settings specified with the +S option,
  such that the combination of options "+S 4:4 +SP 50:50" (in either order)
  results in 2 scheduler threads and 2 scheduler threads online.

  Thanks to Steve Vinoski

- When converting a faulty binary to a list with unicode:characters_to_list, the
  error return value could contain a faulty "rest", i.e. the io_list of
  characters that could not be converted was wrong. This happened only if input
  was a sub binary and conversion was from utf8. This is now corrected.

- erlang:now() could suddenly jump ~24 days into the future on Windows. This is
  now corrected. Thanks to Garret Smith for reporting and testing fixes.

  Own Id: OTP-11146

- erlang:term_to_binary will now cost an appropriate amount of reductions and
  will interrupt (yield) for reschedule if the term is big. This avoids too long
  schedules when term_to_binary is used.

  Impact: Programs running term_to_binary on large terms will run more smothly,
  but rescheduling will impact the single process performance of the BIF. Single
  threaded benchmarks will show degraded performance of the BIF when called with
  very large terms, while general system behaviour will be improved. The
  overhead for allowing restart and reduction counting also degrades local
  performance of the BIF with between 5% and 10% even for small terms.

### Improvements and New Features

- Replaced the lock protecting gathering of garbage collection statistics with a
  lock-free solution.

  Own Id: OTP-10271 Aux Id: kunagi-108 \[04c5410f-9cc4-4696-8639-36bf98686c7a-7]

- Support for migration of memory carriers between memory allocator instances
  has been introduced.

  By default this feature is not enabled and do not effect the characteristics
  of the system. When enabled it has the following impact on the characteristics
  of the system:

  - Reduced memory footprint when the memory load is unevenly distributed
    between scheduler specific allocator instances.
  - Depending on the default allocation strategy used on a specific allocator
    there might or might not be a slight performance loss.
  - When enabled on the `fix_alloc` allocator, a different strategy for
    management of fix blocks will be used.
  - The information returned from
    [`erlang:system_info({allocator, A})`](`m:erlang#system_info_allocator_tuple`),
    and
    [`erlang:system_info({allocator_sizes, A})`](`m:erlang#system_info_allocator_sizes`)
    will be slightly different when this feature has been enabled. An
    `mbcs_pool` tuple will be present giving information about abandoned
    carriers, and in the `fix_alloc` case no `fix_types` tuple will be present.

  For more information, see the documentation of the
  [`+M<S>acul`](erts_alloc.md#M_acul) command line argument.

- Optimization of simultaneous `inet_db` operations on the same socket by using
  a lock free implementation.

  Impact on the characteristics of the system: Improved performance.

  Own Id: OTP-11074

- The `high_msgq_watermark` and `low_msgq_watermark` `inet` socket options
  introduced in OTP-R16A could only be set on TCP sockets. These options are now
  generic and can be set on all types of sockets.

  Own Id: OTP-11075 Aux Id: OTP-10336

- A new better algorithm for management of the process, and port tables has been
  introduced.

  Impact on the characteristics of the system:

  - The new algorithm ensures that both insert and delete operations can be made
    in O(1) time complexity. Previously used algorithm either caused insert or
    delete to be O(N).
  - The new algorithm will also ensure that reuse of identifiers will be less
    frequent than when the old algorithm was used.
  - Previously used algorithm ensured that the latest created identifier
    compared as the largest when comparing two identifiers of the same type that
    had been created on the same node as long as no identifiers had been reused.
    Since identifiers can be reused quite fast, one has never been able to rely
    on this property. Due to the introduction of this new algorithm this
    property will not hold even if no identifiers has been reused yet. This
    could be considered as an incompatibility.

  Due to the above mensioned potential incompatibility, it will still be
  possible to enable the old algorithm for some time. The command line argument
  [`+P legacy`](erl_cmd.md#%2BP) will enable the old algorithm on the process
  table, and [`+Q legacy`](erl_cmd.md#%2BQ) will do the same for the port table.
  These command line arguments are however deprecated as of their introduction
  and have been scheduled for removal in OTP-R18.

### Known Bugs and Problems

- Miscellaneous native code in OTP misbehave either due to lengthy execution, or
  due to not bumping reductions properly. Problems typically occur when passing
  huge sets of data to a misbehaving BIF. Fixing this has high priority and is
  being worked on, but there will remain issues like this for some time.

  In order to alleviate problems with scheduling which might occur when
  executing misbehaving native code, the command line argument
  [\+sfwi](erl_cmd.md#%2Bsfwi) has been introduced.

  By default this feature is disabled and you are advised not to enable it if
  you do not encounter problems with misbehaving native code.

  When enabled it has the following impact on the characteristics of the system:

  - Work will always be distributed between schedulers even when executing
    misbehaving native code.
  - It may cause an increased amount of processes and/or ports bouncing between
    schedulers which in turn will cause a performance loss.
  - It may cause reduced performance due to reduced or lost work compaction when
    all schedulers do not execute under full load.
  - An increased contention on run queue locks.

## Erts 5.10.1.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- A bug in the implementation of offline schedulers has been fixed. The bug was
  introduced in OTP-R16A/ERTS-5.10, and caused work-stealing between schedulers
  to fail. This in turn, caused work to accumulate in some run-queues. The bug
  was only triggered when there were offline schedulers in the system, i.e.,
  when the amount of online schedulers was less than the total amount of
  schedulers. The effect of the bug got more severe the larger amount of offline
  schedulers the system had.

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

  Own Id: OTP-11000

### Improvements and New Features

- Scheduler threads will now by default be less eager requesting wakeup due to
  certain cleanup operations. This can also be controlled using the
  [`+swct`](erl_cmd.md#%2Bswct) command line argument of [`erl(1)`](erl_cmd.md).

- Bugs due to the port optimizations introduced in erts-5.10/OTP-R16A have been
  fixed:

  - Memory leak when terminating ports
  - Memory leak when reaching the system limit of maximum amount of concurrently
    existing ports
  - Crashes due to missing, or late test of bad port handle
  - The newly introduced driver API function `erl_drv_busy_msgq_limits()` could

  Own Id: OTP-10841

- A bug in an ERTS internal queue implementation could cause the loss of a wake
  up signal to a consumer thread. This has now been fixed.

  The effect of this bug, when triggered, was often only a small or even no
  delay of certain operations. This since, threads often are woken due to other
  unrelated reasons. However, if the consumer thread was not woken due to other
  reasons when the bug was triggered, these operations could be left hanging,
  potentially for ever. Such effects seems to have been very rare, but we have
  on at least one occasion gotten a report about such an issue.

  Operations potentially effected by this bug:

  - **Inspection of memory allocation status** - The Erlang process calling
    `erlang:memory/[0,1]`, or
    `erlang:system_info({allocator|allocator_sizes, _})` could potentially hang
    waiting for responses from involved threads.

  - **Async thread pool jobs** - An async thread pool job request and/or reply
    could potentially be left hanging. In OTP this only effected file
    operations, but user implemented drivers using the async thread pool were
    also effected. In the file operation case, this would typically translate
    into an Erlang process potentially hanging on the file operation.

  - **Shutting down the runtime system** - Due to the issue with the async
    thread pool mentioned above, flushing of I/O while terminating the runtime
    system could also potentially hang.

  - **ETS memory deallocation** - Scheduled jobs handling deallocation of the
    main structure of an ETS table could potentially hang. This more or less
    only translates into minor memory leaks.

  - **Shutting down distribution** - The distribution shutdown phase used when
    manually shutting down the distribution, i.e., when calling
    `net_kernel:stop()`, could potentially hang.

  Own Id: OTP-10170

- Added four new bifs, `erlang:binary_to_integer/1,2`,
  `erlang:integer_to_binary/1`, `erlang:binary_to_float/1` and
  `erlang:float_to_binary/1,2`. These bifs work similarly to how their list
  counterparts work, except they operate on binaries. In most cases converting
  from and to binaries is faster than converting from and to lists.

  These bifs are auto-imported into erlang source files and can therefore be
  used without the `erlang` prefix.

  the NIF API function
  [`enif_consume_timeslice()`](erl_nif.md#enif_consume_timeslice) have been
  introduced.

  These functions are provided in order to better support co-operative
  scheduling, improve system responsiveness, and to make it easier to prevent
  misbehaviors of the VM due to a process or port monopolizing a scheduler
  thread. They can be used when dividing lengthy work into a number of repeated
  calls without the need to use threads.

- Change caching policy for memory segment allocator. For instance, prefer sbc
  segments over mbc segments, caching policy is time-arrow aware, evicting older

  The default number of cacheable segment has been increased from five to ten
  segments. This can be modified, same as before, with the command line option
  `+MMmcs 5`

  Impact: Increased speed for processing on larger objects, e.g. binaries.
  Slight increase of mapped and resident memory. Tune your system with memory
  options to `erl` for best performance.

- As of ERTS-5.10/OTP-R16A node names passed in the EPMD protocol are required
  to be encoded in UTF-8. Since EPMD previously accepted latin1 encoded node

  required characters in node names to be 7-bit ASCII characters (and still do
  require this), this incompatibility should not effect anyone using EPMD as an
  Erlang Port Mapper Daemon.

- Fix fd leak when using async thread pool

  When using the async thread pool, if an erlang process asks to open a file and

### Improvements and New Features

- A boolean socket option 'ipv6_v6only' for IPv6 sockets has been added. The
  default value of the option is OS dependent, so applications aiming to be
  portable should consider using `{ipv6_v6only,true}` when creating an `inet6`
  listening/destination socket, and if necessary also create an `inet` socket on
  the same port for IPv4 traffic. See the documentation.

- It is now allowed to define stubs for BIFs, to allow type specs to be written
  for BIFs. For example, if there is BIF called `lists:member/2`, a dummy

- Process optimizations. The most notable:

  - New internal process table implementation allowing for both parallel reads
    as well as writes. Especially read operations have become really cheap. This
    reduce contention in various situations. For example when, spawning
    processes, terminating processes, sending messages, etc.
  - Optimizations of run queue management reducing contention.
  - Optimizations of process internal state changes reducing contention.

  These changes imply changes of the characteristics the system. Most notable:
  changed timing in the system.

- Non-blocking code loading. Earlier when an Erlang module was loaded, all other
  execution in the VM were halted while the load operation was carried out in
  single threaded mode. Now modules are loaded without blocking the VM.
  Processes may continue executing undisturbed in parallel during the entire
  load operation. The load operation is completed by making the loaded code
  visible to all processes in a consistent way with one single atomic
  instruction. Non-blocking code loading will improve realtime characteristics
  when modules are loaded/upgraded on a running SMP system.

  Impact: Reduces size on object allocated in multiblock carriers by one word

  Own Id: OTP-10273 Aux Id: kunagi-20 \[20]

- Major port improvements. The most notable:

  - New internal port table implementation allowing for both parallel reads as
    well as writes. Especially read operations have become really cheap.This
    reduce contention in various situations. For example when, creating ports,
    terminating ports, etc.
  - Dynamic allocation of port structures. This allow for a much larger maximum
    amount of ports allowed as a default. The previous default of 1024 has been
    raised to 65536. Maximum amount of ports can be set using the
    [\+Q](erl_cmd.md#%2BQ) command line flag of [erl(1)](erl_cmd.md). The
    previously used environment variable `ERL_MAX_PORTS` has been deprecated and
    scheduled for removal in OTP-R17.
  - Major rewrite of scheduling of port tasks. Major benefits of the rewrite are
    reduced contention on run queue locks, and reduced amount of memory
    allocation operations needed. The rewrite was also necessary in order to
    make it possible to schedule signals from processes to ports.
  - Improved internal thread progress functionality for easy management of
    unmanaged threads. This improvement was necessary for the rewrite of the
    port task scheduling.
  - Rewrite of all process to port signal implementations in order to make it
    possible to schedule those operations. All port operations can now be
    scheduled which allows for reduced lock contention on the port lock as well
    as truly asynchronous communication with ports.
  - Optimized lookup of port handles from drivers.
  - Optimized driver lookup when creating ports.
  - Preemptible `erlang:ports/0` BIF.
  - Improving responsiveness by bumping reductions for a process calling a
    driver callback directly.

  These changes imply changes of the characteristics of the system. The most
  notable:

  - **Order of signal delivery** - The previous implementation of the VM has
    delivered signals from processes to ports in a synchronous stricter fashion
    than required by the language. As of ERTS version 5.10, signals are truly
    asynchronously delivered. The order of signal delivery still adheres to the
    requirements of the language, but only to the requirements. That is, some
    signal sequences that previously always were delivered in one specific order
    may now from time to time be delivered in different orders. This may cause
    Erlang programs that have made _false assumptions_ about signal delivery
    order to fail even though they previously succeeded. For more information
    about signal ordering guarantees, see the chapter on
    [communication](communication.md) in the ERTS user's guide. The `+n` command
    line flag of [erl(1)](erl_cmd.md) can be helpful when trying to find
    signaling order bugs in Erlang code that have been exposed by these changes.

  - **Latency of signals sent from processes to ports** - Signals from processes
    to ports where previously always delivered immediately. This kept latency
    for such communication to a minimum, but it could cause lock contention
    which was very expensive for the system as a whole. In order to keep this
    latency low also in the future, most signals from processes to ports are by
    default still delivered immediately as long as no conflicts occur. Such
    conflicts include not being able to acquire the port lock, but also include
    other conflicts. When a conflict occur, the signal will be scheduled for
    delivery at a later time. A scheduled signal delivery may cause a higher
    latency for this specific communication, but improves the overall
    performance of the system since it reduce lock contention between
    schedulers. The default behavior of only scheduling delivery of these
    signals on conflict can be changed by passing the [\+spp](erl_cmd.md#%2Bspp)
    command line flag to [erl(1)](erl_cmd.md). The behavior can also be changed
    on port basis using the [parallelism](`m:erlang#open_port_parallelism`)
    option of the [open_port/2](`erlang:open_port/2`) BIF.

  - **Execution time of the `erlang:ports/0` BIF** - Since `erlang:ports/0` now
    can be preempted, the responsiveness of the system as a whole has been
    improved. A call to `erlang:ports/0` may, however, take a much longer time
    to complete than before. How much longer time heavily depends on the system
    load.

  - **Reduction cost of calling driver callbacks** - Calling a driver callback
    is quite costly. This was previously not reflected in reduction cost at all.
    Since the reduction cost now has increased, a process performing lots of
    direct driver calls will be scheduled out more frequently than before.

  _Potential incompatibilities_:

  - `driver_send_term()` has been deprecated and has been scheduled for removal
    in OTP-R17. Replace usage of `driver_send_term()` with usage of
    [erl_drv_send_term()](erl_driver.md#erl_drv_send_term).
  - `driver_output_term()` has been deprecated and has been scheduled for
    removal in OTP-R17. Replace usage of `driver_output_term()` with usage of
    [erl_drv_output_term()](erl_driver.md#erl_drv_output_term).
  - The new function
    [erl_drv_busy_msgq_limits()](erl_driver.md#erl_drv_busy_msgq_limits) has
    been added in order to able to control management of port queues.

  The [driver API version](erl_driver.md#version_management) has been bumped to
  2.1 from 2.0 due to the above changes in the driver API.

- The previously (in R15) proposed scheduler wakeup strategy is now used by
  default. This strategy is not as quick to forget about previous overload as
  the previous strategy.

  This change imply changes of the characteristics the system. Most notable:
  When a small overload comes and then disappears repeatedly, the system will
  for a bit longer time be willing to wake up schedulers than before. Timing in
  the system will due to this also change.

  Own Id: OTP-10733

- The runtime system will now by default use 10 async threads if thread support
  has been enabled when building the runtime system.

  This will prevent long blocking file-operations from blocking scheduler
  threads for long periods of time, which can be harmful. Apart from
  file-operations, it also effects other operations scheduled on the async
  thread pool by user implemented drivers.

  The amount of async threads can be controlled by using the
  [`+A`](erl_cmd.md#async_thread_pool_size) command line argument of
  [erl](erl_cmd.md). When running some offline tools you _might_ want to disable
  async threads, but you are advised _not_ to in the general case. Instead, you
  might want to increase the amount of async threads used.

  This change imply changes of the characteristics the system compared to the
  previous default. The responsiveness of the system as a whole will be
  improved. Operations scheduled on the async thread pool will get an increased
  latency. The throughput of these operations may increase, or decrease
  depending on the type of the operations and how they get scheduled. In the
  case of file operations, the throughput very much depends on how the Erlang
  application access files. Multiple concurrent accesses to different files have
  the potential of an increased throughput.

- The default reader group limit has been increased to 64 from 8. This limit can
  be set using the `+rg` command line argument of [erl](erl_cmd.md).

  This change of default value will reduce lock contention on ETS tables using
  the `read_concurrency` option at the expense of memory consumption when the
  amount of schedulers and logical processors are between 8 and 64. For more
  information, see documentation of the `+rg` command line argument of
  [erl](erl_cmd.md).

- Limited support for unicode atoms in the external format and in the internal

- Increased potential concurrency in ETS for `write_concurrency` option. The
  number of internal table locks has increased from 16 to 64. This makes it four
  times less likely that two concurrent processes writing to the same table
  would collide and thereby serialized. The cost is an increased constant memory
  footprint for tables using write_concurrency. The memory consumption per
  inserted record is not affected. The increased footprint can be particularly
  large if `write_concurrency` is combined with `read_concurrency`.

  - If primary archive was named "xxx", then a file in the same directory named
    "xxxyyy" would be interpreted as a file named "yyy" inside the archive.
  - erl_prim_loader did not correctly create and normalize absolute paths for
    primary archive and files inside it, so unless given with exact same path
    files inside the archive would not be found. E.g. if escript was started as
    /full/path/to/xxx then "./xxx/file" would not be found since erl_prim_loader
    would try to match /full/path/to/xxx with /full/path/to/./xxx. Same problem
    with ../.
  - Depending on how the primary archive was built, erl_prim_loader:list_dir/1
    would sometimes return an empty string inside the file list. This was a
    virtual element representing the top directory of the archive. This has been
    removed.

  default, heart could fire even though Erlang was running fine after approx 298
  to 497 days (depending on kernel config). This was due to the behaviour of the
  times(2) system call. Usage of times(2) is now replaced with clock_gettime(2)
  and the CLOCK_MONOTONIC clock, resulting in a more stable solution. The Erlang
  VM itself has used clock_gettime(2) on linux since before R12B, so this only
  affects the heart program.

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- If threads support for the runtime system had been disabled at compile time
  (`--disable-threads` had been passed to `configure`), and the `+A` command
  line argument of `erl` was passed when starting the runtime system,
  [driver_system_info()](erl_driver.md#driver_system_info) erroneously claimed
  that the runtime system had async threads even though it had not.

  Due to this bug the file driver did not split tasks into smaller chunks, but
  instead completed the whole task at once, i.e., the scheduler got occupied
  with I/O for a longer time than intended.

  Own Id: OTP-10059

### Improvements and New Features

- A proposal for a new scheduler wakeup strategy has been implemented. For more
  information see the documentation of the [\+sws](erl_cmd.md#%2Bsws) command
  line argument of `erl`.

  Own Id: OTP-10033 Aux Id: Seq12025

- A switch for configuration of busy wait length for scheduler threads has been

- The extra memory barriers introduced by bug-fix OTP-9281 were unnecessarily
  used also on tables without the `write_concurrency` option enabled. This could
  unnecessarily degrade performance of ETS tables without `write_concurrency` on
  some hardware (e.g. PowerPC) while not effecting performance at all on other
  hardware (e.g. x86/x86_64).

  OTP-9281 (R14B03): ETS tables using the `write_concurrency` option could
  potentially get into an internally inconsistent state.

  Own Id: OTP-9978

- When an escript ends now all printout to standard output and standard error
  gets out on the terminal. This bug has been corrected by changing the
  behaviour of erlang:halt/0,1, which should fix the same problem for other
  escript-like applications, i.e that data stored in the output port driver
  buffers got lost when printing on a TTY and exiting through erlang:halt/0,1.

  The BIF:s erlang:halt/0,1 has gotten improved semantics and there is a new BIF
  erlang:halt/2 to accomplish something like the old semantics. See the
  documentation.

  Now erlang:halt/0 and erlang:halt/1 with an integer argument will close all
  ports and allow all pending async threads operations to finish before exiting
  the emulator. Previously erlang:halt/0 and erlang:halt(0) would just wait for
  pending async threads operations but not close ports. And erlang:halt/1 with a
  non-zero integer argument would not even wait for pending async threads
  operations.

  To roughly the old behaviour, to not wait for ports and async threads
  operations when you exit the emulator, you use erlang:halt/2 with an integer
  first argument and an option list containing \{flush,false\} as the second
  argument. Note that now is flushing not dependent of the exit code, and you
  cannot only flush async threads operations which we deemed as a strange
  behaviour anyway.

  Also, erlang:halt/1,2 has gotten a new feature: If the first argument is the
  atom 'abort' the emulator is aborted producing a core dump, if the operating
  system so allows.

- Honor option `packet_size` for http packet parsing by both TCP socket and
  `erlang:decode_packet`. This gives the ability to accept HTTP headers larger

- Calls to `erlang:system_flag(schedulers_online, N)` and/or
  `erlang:system_flag(multi_scheduling, block|unblock)` could cause internal

  and set time type information in the call. Valid options are
  `{time, local}, {time, universal}` and `{time, posix}`. In the case of `posix`
  time no conversions are made which makes the operation a bit faster.

  Own Id: OTP-7687

- A number of memory allocation optimizations have been implemented. Most
  optimizations reduce contention caused by synchronization between threads
  during allocation and deallocation of memory. Most notably:

  - Synchronization of memory management in scheduler specific allocator
    instances has been rewritten to use lock-free synchronization.
  - Synchronization of memory management in scheduler specific pre-allocators
    has been rewritten to use lock-free synchronization.
  - The 'mseg_alloc' memory segment allocator now use scheduler specific
    instances instead of one instance. Apart from reducing contention this also
    ensures that memory allocators always create memory segments on the local
    NUMA node on a NUMA system.

  Own Id: OTP-7775

- The ethread atomic memory operations API used by the runtime system has been
  extended and improved.

  The ethread library now also performs runtime tests for presence of hardware
  features, such as for example SSE2 instructions, instead of requiring this to
  be determined at compile time.

  All uses of the old deprecated atomic API in the runtime system have been
  replaced with the use of the new atomic API. In a lot of places this change
  imply a relaxation of memory barriers used.

- The ERTS internal system block functionality has been replaced by new
  functionality for blocking the system. The old system block functionality had
  contention issues and complexity issues. The new functionality piggy-backs on
  thread progress tracking functionality needed by newly introduced lock-free
  synchronization in the runtime system. When the functionality for blocking the
  system isn't used, there is more or less no overhead at all. This since the
  functionality for tracking thread progress is there and needed anyway.

  Own Id: OTP-9631

- An ERTS internal, generic, many to one, lock-free queue for communication
  between threads has been introduced. The many to one scenario is very common
  in ERTS, so it can be used in a lot of places in the future. Currently it is
  used by scheduling of certain jobs, and the async thread pool, but more uses
  are planned for the future.

  Drivers using the driver_async functionality are not automatically locked to
  the system anymore, and can be unloaded as any dynamically linked in driver.

  Scheduling of ready async jobs is now also interleaved in between other jobs.
  Previously all ready async jobs were performed at once.

  Own Id: OTP-9632

- Tuple funs (a two-element tuple with a module name and a function) are now

- When loading a module, the system use to run on a single scheduler during the
  entire loading process. This has been changed to only take down the system
  just before inserting the loaded code into the system tables, resulting in a
  much shorter disruption if a module is loaded in a busy system. (Suggested by
  Bob Ippolito.)

- Possible to run HiPE without floating point exceptions (FPE). Useful on
  platforms that lack reliable FPE. Slower float operations compared to HiPE
  with FPE.

  Own Id: OTP-9724

- As of ERTS version 5.9 (OTP-R15B) the runtime system will by default _not_
  bind schedulers to logical processors.

  If the Erlang runtime system is the only operating system process that binds
  threads to logical processors, this improves the performance of the runtime
  system. However, if other operating system processes (as for example another
  Erlang runtime system) also bind threads to logical processors, there might be
  a performance penalty instead. In some cases this performance penalty might be
  severe. Due to this, we change the default so that the user must make an
  active decision in order to bind schedulers.

- The use of `erlang:system_flag(scheduler_bind_type, _)` and

- The driver interface has been changed to enable 64-bit aware drivers. Most
  importantly the return types for ErlDrvEntry callbacks 'call' and 'control'

  emulator crashes. See
  [Rewrites for 64-bit driver interface ](erl_driver.md#rewrites-for-64-bit-driver-interface)in
  the driver manual.

  Due to this driver [version management](erl_driver.md#version_management) is
  now mandatory. A driver that is not written with version management or a
  driver that was compiled with the wrong major version will be not be loaded by
  the emulator.

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Several bugs concerning constant binary constructions such as <<0:4294967295>>
  have been corrected. Depending on the actual size of the binary and the type
  of run-time system (32-bit, halfword, 64-bit), such expression could either
  crash the run-time system or make the loader refuse loading of the module.

  An experimental version of Dialyzer discovered that the atom that replaced the

- inet: error if fd does not match socket domain

  If an IPv4 fd is opened as an IPv6 socket, unexpected behaviour can occur. For
  example, if an IPv4 UDP socket is opened and passed into Erlang as an IPv6
  socket, the first 3 bytes (corresponding to 1 byte representing the protocol
  family, 2 bytes set to the port) are stripped from the payload. The cause of
  the UDP payload truncation happens in inet_drv.c:packet_inet_input when a call
  to inet_get_address fails silently because the family is set to PF_INET6 but
  the buffer len is the size of an IPv4 struct sockaddr_in.

  - On Linux systems not using the NPTL thread library (typically ancient
    systems with kernel versions prior to 2.6) and Windows systems, the
    `{Port, {exit_status, Status}}` message from a terminating port program
    could be delayed. That is, it only effected port programs which had been

- Allow user to specify the IP address epmd binds to

  The IP address(es) epmd binds to can now be specified by the user, either via
  epmd's new "-address" option or (if that's not used) by setting the
  environment variable ERL_EPMD_ADDRESS. Multiple addresses may be specified
  using a comma-separated list. If the loopback address is not in this list, it
  will be added implicitly, so that the daemon can be queried by an interactive
  epmd process.(Thanks to Holger Weiß)

- The following bugs due to missing memory barriers have been fixed:

  - ETS tables using the `write_concurrency` option could potentially get into
    an internally inconsistent state.
  - ETS tables using the `ordered_set` option could potentially get into an
    internally inconsistent state.
  - A number of memory barriers have been added when building with the
    `libatomic_ops` API (i.e. when passing `--with-libatomic_ops=PATH` to
    `configure`) and the tilera atomics API (i.e. when building for the tilera
    chip). Note that these bugs were due to erroneous usage of the APIs, and not
    in the implementations of the APIs. When using these APIs the following bugs
    where present:

    - The BIF `erlang:ports/0` could return an erroneous result.
    - A thread blocking other threads during code loading, or setup of tracing
      could potentially read invalid data.
    - Fixation of ETS tables could potentially get into an internally
      inconsistent state.

### Improvements and New Features

- New `enif_is_exception function` to allow NIFs to determine whether an
  `ERL_NIF_TERM` represents an exception. (Thanks to Steve Vinoski)

  Own Id: OTP-9150

- A process being garbage collected by another process could be scheduled on
  another scheduler. This prevented this scheduler from doing any useful work
  until the garbage collection was done. This either occurred due to a explicit
  call to the [`garbage_collect/1`](`garbage_collect/1`) BIF, or due to a
  garbage collection part of code loading. A process being garbage collected
  like this will now not be scheduled until the garbage collection has
  completed.

- Due to standard library DLL mismatches between versions of OpenSSL and
  Erlang/OTP, OpenSSL is now linked statically to the crypto driver on Windows.
  This fixes problems starting crypto when running Erlang as a service on all
  Windows versions.

- Halfword emulator memory handling improvements:

  - Much more of internal memory structures have been made able to use "high"
    memory and are no longer restricted to the 4Gb limit that still applies for
    all process heap data.
  - Fixed faulty values from `erlang:memory()` caused by 32-bit counter
    overflow.
  - New counter `low` in `erlang:memory()` that sums up all memory restricted by
    4Gb limit.

- Ets table type ordered_set could order large integer keys wrongly on pure
  64bit platforms. This is now corrected.

  Own Id: OTP-9181

- The status of a process was unnecessarily set to waiting before a process was
  enqueued in a run queue. This bug was harmless up until OTP-R14B01. In
  OTP-R14B02 `erlang:hibernate/3` was fixed (OTP-9125). After the introduction
  of OTP-9125, the previously harmless process status bug sometimes caused
  erroneous badarg exceptions from `process_info()`.

  OTP-9125 also introduced a thread unsafe access to the status field of a
  process which now also have been fixed.

  Own Id: OTP-9056 Aux Id: Seq11779

- Two problems were fixed in crash dump: The time left for timers are now shown
  as unsigned integers and the contents of ordered_set ETS tables is no longer
  included.

  Own Id: OTP-9057

- The VM could fail to set IP_TOS and SO_PRIORITY in certain situations, either
  because sockets were supplied as open file descriptors, or because SO_PRIORITY
  by default was set higher than the user can explicitly set it to. Those
  situations are now handled.

  Own Id: OTP-9117

- Fix erlang:hibernate/3 on HiPE enabled emulator (Thanks to Paul Guyot)

  Own Id: OTP-9125

### Improvements and New Features

- From this release, the previously experimental halfword emulator is now
  official. It can be enabled by giving the `--enable-halfword-emulator` option
  to the `configure` script.

  The halfword emulator is a 64-bit application, but uses halfwords (32-bit
  words) for all data in Erlang processes, therefore using less memory and being
  faster than the standard 64-bit emulator. The total size of all BEAM code and
  all process data for all processes is limited to 4Gb, but ETS tables and
  off-heap binaries are only limited by the amount of available memory.

  Own Id: OTP-8941

- 32-bit atomic memory operations have been introduced internally in the run
  time system, and are now used where appropriate. There were previously only
  atomic memory operations of word size available. The 32-bit atomic memory
  operations slightly reduce memory consumption, and slightly improve
  performance on 64-bit runtime systems.

  Own Id: OTP-8974

- Performance enhancements for looking up timer-entries and removing timers from
  the wheel.

  Own Id: OTP-8990

- Write accesses to ETS tables have been optimized by reducing the amount of
  atomic memory operations needed during a write access.

  Own Id: OTP-9000

- Strange C coding in the VM made the -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE option to gcc-4.5 react
  badly. The code is now cleaned up so that it's accepted by gcc-4.5.

  Own Id: OTP-9025

- The memory footprint for loaded code has been somewhat reduced (especially in
  the 64-bit BEAM machine).

  Own Id: OTP-9030

- The maximum number of allowed arguments for an Erlang function has been
  lowered from 256 to 255, so that the number of arguments can now fit in a
  byte.

  Own Id: OTP-9049

- Dependency generation for Makefiles has been added to the compiler and erlc.
  See the manual pages for `compile` and `erlc`. (Thanks to Jean-Sebastien
  Pedron.)

  Own Id: OTP-9065

## Erts 5.8.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fix format_man_pages so it handles all man sections and remove warnings/errors
  in various man pages.

  Own Id: OTP-8600

- The `configure` command line argument
  [\--enable-ethread-pre-pentium4-compatibility](`e:system:install.md#advanced-configuration-and-build-of-erlang-otp`)
  had no effect. This option is now also automatically enabled if required on
  the build machine.

  Own Id: OTP-8847

- Windows 2003 and Windows XP pre SP3 would sometimes not start the Erlang R14B
  VM at all due to a bug in the cpu topology detection. The bug affects Windows
  only, no other platform is even remotely affected. The bug is now corrected.

  Own Id: OTP-8876

- The HiPE run-time in the 64-bit emulator could do a 64-bit write to a 32-bit
  struct field. It happened to be harmless on Intel/AMD processors. Corrected.
  (Thanks to Mikael Pettersson.)

  Own Id: OTP-8877

- A bug in [erl_drv_tsd_get()](erl_driver.md#erl_drv_tsd_get) and
  [enif_tsd_get()](erl_nif.md#enif_tsd_get) could cause an emulator crash. These
  functions are currently not used in OTP. That is, the crash only occur on
  systems with user implemented NIF libraries, or drivers that use one of these
  functions.

  Own Id: OTP-8889

- Calling `erlang:system_info({cpu_topology, CpuTopologyType})` with another
  `CpuTopologyType` element than one of the documented atoms `defined`,
  `detected`, or `used` caused an emulator crash. (Thanks to Paul Guyot)

  Own Id: OTP-8914

- The ERTS internal rwlock implementation could get into an inconsistent state.
  This bug was very seldom triggered, but could be during heavy contention. The
  bug was introduced in R14B (erts-5.8.1).

  The bug was most likely to be triggered when using the `read_concurrency`
  option on an ETS table that was frequently accessed from multiple processes
  doing lots of writes and reads. That is, in a situation where you typically
  don't want to use the `read_concurrency` option in the first place.

  Own Id: OTP-8925 Aux Id: OTP-8544

- Tracing to port could cause an emulator crash when unloading the trace driver.

  Own Id: OTP-8932

- Removed use of CancelIoEx on Windows that had been shown to cause problems
  with some drivers.

  Own Id: OTP-8937

- The fallback implementation used when no native atomic implementation was
  found did not compile. (Thanks to Patrick Baggett, and Tuncer Ayaz)

  Own Id: OTP-8944

- Some integer values used during load balancing could under rare circumstances
  wrap causing a load unbalance between schedulers.

  Own Id: OTP-8950

- The windows VM now correctly handles appending to large files (> 4GB).

  Own Id: OTP-8958

- Name resolving of IPv6 addresses has been implemented for Windows versions
  that support it. The use of ancient resolver flags (AI_V4MAPPED |
  AI_ADDRCONFIG) to the getaddrinfo() function has been removed since e.g
  FreeBSD regard mapped IPv4 addresses to be a security problem and the
  semantics of the address configured flag is uncertain.

  Own Id: OTP-8969

### Improvements and New Features

- The help texts produced by the `configure` scripts in the top directory and in
  the erts directory have been aligned and cleaned up.

  Own Id: OTP-8859

- When the runtime system had fewer schedulers than logical processors, the
  system could get an unnecessarily large amount reader groups.

  Own Id: OTP-8861

- `run_rel` has been updated to support Solaris's /dev/ptmx device and to load
  the necessary STREAMS modules so that `to_erl` can provide terminal echo of
  keyboard input. (Thanks to Ryan Tilder.)

  Own Id: OTP-8878

- The Erlang VM now supports Unicode filenames. The feature is turned on by
  default on systems where Unicode filenames are mandatory (Windows and MacOSX),
  but can be enabled on other systems with the '+fnu' emulator option. Enabling
  the Unicode filename feature on systems where it is not default is however
  considered experimental and not to be used for production. Together with the
  Unicode file name support, the concept of "raw filenames" is introduced, which
  means filenames provided without implicit unicode encoding translation. Raw
  filenames are provided as binaries, not lists. For further information, see
  stdlib users guide and the chapter about using Unicode in Erlang. Also see the
  file module manual page.

  `run_test`, `heart`, `escript`, and `erlexec`.

  (Thanks to Michael Santos.)

  Own Id: OTP-8892

- The runtime system is now less eager to suspend processes sending messages
  over the distribution. The default value of the distribution buffer busy limit
  has also been increased from 128 KB to 1 MB. This in order to improve
  throughput.

  Own Id: OTP-8901

- The distribution buffer busy limit can now be configured at system startup.

  [\+zdbbl](erl_cmd.md#%2Bzdbbl) command line flag. (Thanks to Scott Lystig
  Fritchie)

  Own Id: OTP-8912

- The inet driver internal buffer stack implementation has been rewritten in
  order to reduce lock contention.

  Own Id: OTP-8916

- New ETS option `compressed`, to enable a more compact storage format at the
  expence of heavier table operations. For test and evaluation, `erl +ec` can be
  used to force compression on all ETS tables.

  Own Id: OTP-8922 Aux Id: seq11658

- There is now a new function inet:getifaddrs/0 modeled after C library function
  getifaddrs() on BSD and LInux that reports existing interfaces and their
  addresses on the host. This replaces the undocumented and unsupported
  inet:getiflist/0 and inet:ifget/2.

  Own Id: OTP-8926

- Support for detection of CPU topology and binding of schedulers on FreeBSD 8
  have been added. (Thanks to Paul Guyot)

- Several bugs related to hibernate/3 and HiPE have been corrected. (Thanks to
  Paul Guyot.)

  Own Id: OTP-8952

- Support for soft and hard links on Windows versions and filesystems that
  support them is added.

  Own Id: OTP-8955

- The win32 virtual machine is now linked large address aware. his allows the
  Erlang VM to use up to 3 gigs of address space on Windows instead of the
  default of 2 gigs.

  Own Id: OTP-8956

## Erts 5.8.1.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fix that the documentation top index generator can handle an Ericsson internal
  application group.

  Own Id: OTP-8875

- In embedded mode, on_load handlers that called `code:priv_dir/1` or other
  functions in `code` would hang the system. Since the `crypto` application now
  contains an on_loader handler that calls `code:priv_dir/1`, including the
  `crypto` application in the boot file would prevent the system from starting.

  Also extended the `-init_debug` option to print information about on_load
  handlers being run to facilitate debugging.

## Erts 5.8.1.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

  Own Id: OTP-8876

## Erts 5.8.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Very small floating point numbers generated errors when converting from list
  to float in some versions of the VM, this is now corrected so that i.e.
  list_to_float("1.0e-324"). returns 0.0 in all versions of Erlang.

  Own Id: OTP-7178

- Windows Vista and Windows 7 file system virtualization, which makes "old
  style" windows programs execute in a file system sandbox, was previously
  unintentionally turned on for the Erlang VM. This is now corrected so that
  i.e. writes to C:\\Program Files\\. without administrator privileges will
  fail.

  Own Id: OTP-7405

- Fix faulty 64-bit integer term output from drivers. Large 64-bits integers did
  not generate correct bignums and could even cause emulator crash. Only affects
  drivers using ERL_DRV_INT64 or ERL_DRV_UINT64, introduced in R13B03.

  Own Id: OTP-8716

- Fixed: inet:setopts(S, \[\{linger,\{true,2\}\}]) returned \{error,einval\} for
  SCTP sockets. The inet_drv had a bug when checking the option size.

  Own Id: OTP-8728

- gen_udp:connect/3 was broken for SCTP enabled builds. It did not detect remote
  end errors as it should.

  Own Id: OTP-8729

- Reduce the risk of integer wrapping in bin vheap size counting.

  The vheap size series will now use the golden ratio instead of doubling and
  fibonacci sequences.

  Own Id: OTP-8730

- ETS ordered_set containing `[]` as key could cause strange thing to happen,
  like an infinite hanging `ets:select`.

  Own Id: OTP-8732

- reference() has been substituted for ref() in the documentation.

  Own Id: OTP-8733

- When a native compiled module called a not loaded non-native compiled module
  that had an on_load function, the export entries were trashed after code
  loading so on the next call from the native compiled module to the non-native
  compiled the emulator crashed. This bug has now been fixed.

  Own Id: OTP-8736

- HiPE-enabled Erlang VMs running on BSD systems sometimes generated messages
  like "Yikes\! erts_alloc() returned misaligned address 0x8016a512c". Fixed.
  (Thanks to Mikael Pettersson.)

  Own Id: OTP-8769

- A race condition in `erts_poll()` could cause delay of poll for I/O.

  Own Id: OTP-8773

- Removed some potential vulnerabilities from the Erlang Port Mapper Daemon
  (epmd) and straightened up access control. Also removed hazardous interfaces
  allowing anyone on a machine to forcefully unregister other nodes. This means
  that the ei_unregister/erl_unregister interfaces in erl_interface is rendered
  not only error prone and mystifying as before, but totally ineffective. The
  old behaviour of unchecked node unregistering can be restored if needed, see
  epmd documentation for details.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-8780

- Building in a source tree without prebuilt platform independent build results
  failed on the SSL examples when:

  Own Id: OTP-8821

- A rare memory leak in binary:matches is removed

  Own Id: OTP-8823

- For a socket in the HTTP packet mode, the return value from `gen_tcp:recv/2,3`
  if there is an error in the header will be `{ok,{http_error,String}}` instead

  Own Id: OTP-8831

### Improvements and New Features

- ets:select_reverse/\{1,2,3\} are now documented.

  Own Id: OTP-7863

- External format of integers changed to make full use of all 32 bits of
  INTEGER_EXT. This is a compatible change as old code can read full 32-bit
  integers but only produce 28-bit integers as INTEGER_EXT.

  Own Id: OTP-8540 Aux Id: seq11534

- Large parts of the `ethread` library have been rewritten. The `ethread`
  library is an Erlang runtime system internal, portable thread library used by
  the runtime system itself.

  Most notable improvement is a reader optimized rwlock implementation which
  dramatically improve the performance of read-lock/read-unlock operations on
  multi processor systems by avoiding ping-ponging of the rwlock cache lines.
  The reader optimized rwlock implementation is used by miscellaneous rwlocks in
  the runtime system that are known to be read-locked frequently, and can be
  enabled on ETS tables by passing the
  [\{read_concurrency, true\}](`m:ets#new_2_read_concurrency`) option upon table
  creation. See the documentation of `ets:new/2` for more information. The
  reader optimized rwlock implementation can be fine tuned when starting the
  runtime system. For more information, see the documentation of the
  [\+rg](erl_cmd.md#%2Brg) command line argument of `erl`.

  There is also a new implementation of rwlocks that is not optimized for
  readers. Both implementations interleaves readers and writers during
  contention as opposed to, e.g., the NPTL (Linux) pthread rwlock implementation
  which use either a reader or writer preferred strategy. The reader/writer
  preferred strategy is problematic since it starves threads doing the
  non-preferred operation.

  The new rwlock implementations in general performs better in ERTS than common
  pthread implementations. However, in some extremely heavily contended cases
  this is not the case. Such heavy contention can more or less only appear on
  ETS tables. This when multiple processes do very large amounts of write locked
  operations simultaneously on the same table. Such use of ETS is bad regardless
  of rwlock implementation, will never scale, and is something we strongly
  advise against.

  The new rwlock implementations depend on atomic operations. If no native
  atomic implementation is found, a fallback solution will be used. Using the
  fallback implies a performance degradation. That is, it is more important now
  than before to build OTP with a native atomic implementation.

  The `ethread` library contains native atomic implementations for, x86 (32 and
  64 bit), powerpc (32 bit), sparc V9 (32 and 64 bit), and tilera (32 bit). On
  other hardware gcc's builtin support for atomic memory access will be used if
  such exists. If no such support is found, `configure` will warn about no
  atomic implementation available.

  The `ethread` library can now also use the `libatomic_ops` library for atomic
  memory accesses. This makes it possible for the Erlang runtime system to
  utilize optimized native atomic operations on more platforms than before. If
  `configure` warns about no atomic implementation available, try using the
  `libatomic_ops` library. Use the
  [\--with-libatomic_ops=PATH](`e:system:install.md#advanced-configuration-and-build-of-erlang-otp`)
  `configure` command line argument when specifying where the `libatomic_ops`
  installation is located. The `libatomic_ops` library can be downloaded from:
  [http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/atomic_ops/](http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/atomic_ops/)

  The changed API of the `ethread` library has also caused modifications in the
  Erlang runtime system. Preparations for the to come "delayed deallocation"
  feature has also been done since it depends on the `ethread` library.

  _Note_: When building for x86, the `ethread` library will now use instructions
  that first appeared on the pentium 4 processor. If you want the runtime system
  to be compatible with older processors (back to 486) you need to pass the
  [\--enable-ethread-pre-pentium4-compatibility](`e:system:install.md#advanced-configuration-and-build-of-erlang-otp`)
  `configure` command line argument when configuring the system.

- Alignment of trailing data in messages has been adjusted. This in order to be
  able to pass data of any type as trailing data in the future.

- The obsolete/driver.h header file has been removed. It has been obsolete and
  deprecated since R8B. Drivers that still include obsolete/driver.h must be
  updated to include erl_driver.h.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-8758

- Added erlang:system_info(build_type) which makes it easier to chose drivers,
  NIF libraries, etc based on build type of the runtime system.

  The NIF library for crypto can now be built for valgrind and/or debug as
  separate NIF libraries that will be automatically loaded if the runtime system
  has been built with a matching build type.

  Own Id: OTP-8760

- Further lessened the memory requirements of ETS objects.

  Own Id: OTP-8762

- The broken elib_malloc alternate memory allocator has been removed.
  `erlang:system_info(elib_malloc)` will always return `false`, and in R15,
  `erlang:system_info(elib_malloc)` will fail with a `badarg` exception.

  Own Id: OTP-8764

- Calling `erlang:system_info/1` with the new argument `update_cpu_info` will
  make the runtime system reread and update the internally stored CPU
  information. For more information see the documentation of
  [erlang:system_info(update_cpu_info)](`m:erlang#system_info_update_cpu_info`).

  The CPU topology is now automatically detected on Windows systems with less
  than 33 logical processors. The runtime system will now, also on Windows, by
  default bind schedulers to logical processors using the `default_bind` bind
  type if the amount of schedulers is at least equal to the amount of logical
  processors configured, binding of schedulers is supported, and a CPU topology
  is available at startup.

- The SMP ERTS internal child waiter thread used on Linux system with NPTL was
  unintentionally disabled during cross compilation rewrites (OTP-8323 in
  R13B03). It has now been re-enabled. Enabling it again gives a slight
  performance improvement.

  Own Id: OTP-8774

- `epmd` used to generate a message to the syslog when it started up, which
  could be annoying. This has been changed to only generate the message if the
  debug switch is given. (Thanks to Michael Santos.)

- The undocumented function inet:ifget/2 has been improved to return interface
  hardware address (MAC) on platforms supporting getaddrinfo() (such as BSD
  unixes). Note it still does not work on all platforms for example not Windows

  [port data locks](erl_driver.md#ErlDrvPDL) peeked at the port status field
  without proper locking when looking up the driver queue.

  Own Id: OTP-8475

- The use of `mmap()` was unnecessarily disabled when cross compiling.

  The `configure` arguments `--with-ssl`, and `--with-odbc` refused to accept
  libraries outside of `$erl_xcomp_sysroot` when cross compiling for no good
  reason.

  The `configure` argument `--with-odbc` didn't handle the value `yes` correct.

  The `configure` arguments `--with-odbc`, and `--without-odbc` have also been
  added to the configure help.

- [`open_port/2`](`open_port/2`) with the `spawn` and `spawn_executable` options
  can include an `{env,Env}` option. In some cases unsetting variables would not
  work on Unix (typically if more variables were unset than were actually
  present in the environment).

- A user defined CPU topology set via a call to
  [erlang:system_flag(cpu_topology, CPUTopology)](`m:erlang#system_flag_cpu_topology`)

### Improvements and New Features

- The grammar for match specifications in ERTS users guide only described the
  tracing dialect of match specifications. An informal grammar for the ETS
  dialect is added.

  been included in the lists of BIFs allowed in guards in the Reference Manual.

  Own Id: OTP-8477

- Added function `zip:foldl/3` to iterate over zip archives.

  Added functions to create and extract escripts. See `escript:create/2` and
  `escript:extract/2`.

  The undocumented function `escript:foldl/3` has been removed. The same
  functionality can be achieved with the more flexible functions
  `escript:extract/2` and `zip:foldl/3`.

  Record fields has been annotated with type info. Source files as been adapted
  to fit within 80 chars and trailing whitespace has been removed.

  Own Id: OTP-8521

- A regular expression with many levels of parenthesis could cause a buffer
  overflow. That has been corrected. (Thanks to Michael Santos.)

  Own Id: OTP-8539

- `erlang:decode_packet(httph_bin,..)` could return corrupt header strings or
  even crash the VM. This has been fixed. It only happened on 32-bit VM if the
  header name was unknown and between 16 and 20 characters long. Sockets with
  simular `packet` option did not suffer from this bug.

  Own Id: OTP-8548

- New NIF features:

  - Send messages from a NIF, or from thread created by NIF, to any local
    process (`enif_send`)
  - Store terms between NIF calls (`enif_alloc_env`, `enif_make_copy`)
  - Create binary terms with user defined memory management
    (`enif_make_resource_binary`)

  And some incompatible changes made to the API. For more information see the
  warning text in [erl_nif(3)](erl_nif.md).

- If the '`fop`' program (needed for building PDF files) cannot not be found, it
  is now possible to build the HTML and man pages anyway (there will also be
  dummy PDF files with no real content created). (Thanks to Tuncer Ayaz.)

  Own Id: OTP-8559

- When defining macros the closing right parenthesis before the dot is now
  mandatory.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-8562

- Local and imported functions now override the auto-imported BIFs when the
  names clash. The pre R14 behaviour was that auto-imported BIFs would override
  local functions. To avoid that old programs change behaviour, the following
  will generate an error:

  - Doing a call without explicit module name to a local function having a name
    clashing with the name of an auto-imported BIF that was present (and
    auto-imported) before OTP R14A
  - Explicitly importing a function having a name clashing with the name of an
    autoimported BIF that was present (and autoimported) before OTP R14A
  - Using any form of the old compiler directive `nowarn_bif_clash`

  If the BIF was added or auto-imported in OTP R14A or later, overriding it with
  an import or a local function will only result in a warning,

  To resolve clashes, you can either use the explicit module name `erlang` to
  call the BIF, or you can remove the auto-import of that specific BIF by using
  the new compiler directive `-compile({no_auto_import,[F/A]}).`, which makes
  all calls to the local or imported function without explicit module name pass
  without warnings or errors.

  The change makes it possible to add auto-imported BIFs without breaking or
  silently changing old code in the future. However some current code
  ingeniously utilizing the old behaviour or the `nowarn_bif_clash` compiler
  directive, might need changing to be accepted by the compiler.

  Own Id: OTP-8579

- A bug in re that could cause certain regular expression matches never to
  terminate is corrected. (Thanks to Michael Santos and Gordon Guthrie.)

  Own Id: OTP-8589

- The erlang:open_port spawn and spawn_executable directives can include an
  `{env,Env}` directive to set up environment variables for the spawned process.
  A bug prevented applications from using `{env,Env}` to set an environment
  variable whose value ended with a '`=`' (equal sign) character; the trailing
  equal sign was mistaken as an indication that an environment variable was to
  be cleared from the environment of the spawned process. (Thanks to Steve
  Vinoski.)

  Own Id: OTP-8614

- `receive` statements that can only read out a newly created reference are now
  specially optimized so that it will execute in constant time regardless of the
  number of messages in the receive queue for the process. That optimization
  will benefit calls to `gen_server:call()`. (See `gen:do_call/4` for an example
  of a receive statement that will be optimized.)

  Own Id: OTP-8623

- The functions file:advise/4 and file:datasync/1 have been added. (Thanks to
  Filipe David Manana.)

  Own Id: OTP-8637

- New NIF API functions: `enif_make_atom_len`, `enif_make_existing_atom_len`,
  `enif_make_string_len`, `enif_get_atom_length`, `enif_get_list_length`,
  `enif_is_list`, `enif_is_tuple` (by Tuncer Ayaz)

  Own Id: OTP-8640

- Support for using gcc's built-in functions for atomic memory access has been
  added. This functionality will be used if available and no other native atomic
  implementation in ERTS is available.

  Own Id: OTP-8659

- The number of spinlocks used when implementing atomic fall-backs when no
  native atomic implementation is available has been increased from 16 to 1024.

  Own Id: OTP-8660

- Writer preferred pthread read/write locks has been enabled on Linux.

  Own Id: OTP-8661

- The runtime system will by default bind schedulers to logical processors using
  the `default_bind` bind type if the amount of schedulers are at least equal to
  the amount of logical processors configured, binding of schedulers is
  supported, and a CPU topology is available at startup.

  _NOTE:_ If the Erlang runtime system is the only operating system process that
  binds threads to logical processors, this improves the performance of the
  runtime system. However, if other operating system processes (as for example
  another Erlang runtime system) also bind threads to logical processors, there
  might be a performance penalty instead. If this is the case you, are are
  advised to unbind the schedulers using the [\+sbtu](erl_cmd.md#%2Bsbt) command
  line argument, or by invoking
  [erlang:system_flag(scheduler_bind_type, unbound)](`m:erlang#system_flag_scheduler_bind_type`).

  Own Id: OTP-8666

- The recently added BIFs erlang:min/2, erlang:max/2 and erlang:port_command/3
  are now auto-imported (as they were originally intended to be). Due to the
  recent compiler change (OTP-8579), the only impact on old code defining it's
  own min/2, max/2 or port_command/3 functions will be a warning, the local
  functions will still be used. The warning can be removed by using
  -compile(\{no_auto_import,\[min/2,max/2,port_command/3]\}). in the source
  file.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-8669 Aux Id: OTP-8579

- There is a new option 'exclusive' to file:open/2 that uses the OS O_EXCL flag
  where supported to open the file in exclusive mode.

  Own Id: OTP-8670

- Now, binary_to_term/2 is auto-imported. This will cause a compile warning if
  and only if a module has got a local function with that name.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-8671

- Alignment of scheduler data and run queues were adjusted.

  Own Id: OTP-8673

- Call time breakpoint tracing

  - Introduce a `call_time` option to `erlang:trace_pattern/3`.This option
    enables call time breakpoint tracing on code that is executed by processes
    with call tracing enabled. Call time tracing stores the number of calls and
    the time spent of each function with this trace pattern enabled. The
    information can be retrieved with `erlang:trace_info/2`
  - Add a scheduler array for BpData. To solve the issue of multiple schedulers
    constantly updating the head pointer to the bp data wheel, each scheduler
    now has its own entrypoint to the wheel. This head pointer can be updated
    without a locking being taken.

  Teach call count tracing to use atomics

  - Call count previously used a global lock for accessing and writing its
    counter in the breakpoint. This is now changed to atomics instead.
  - The change will let call count tracing and cprof to scale better when
    increasing the number of schedulers.

  Own Id: OTP-8677

- `eprof` has been reimplemented with support in the Erlang virtual machine and
  is now both faster (i.e. slows down the code being measured less) and scales
  much better. In measurements we saw speed-ups compared to the old eprof
  ranging from 6 times (for sequential code that only uses one scheduler/core)
  up to 84 times (for parallel code that uses 8 cores).

  Note: The API for the `eprof` has been cleaned up and extended. See the
  documentation.

- ERTS makefiles used to detect the use of a gcc C compiler by checking if CC
  equaled gcc. That is, the makefiles failed to detect gcc C compilers with

- The resolver routines failed to look up the own node name as hostname, if the
  OS native resolver was erroneously configured, bug reported by Yogish Baliga,
  now fixed.

  The resolver routines now tries to parse the hostname as an IP string as most
  OS resolvers do, unless the native resolver is used.

  The DNS resolver inet_res and file resolver inet_hosts now do not read OS
  configuration files until they are needed. Since the native resolver is
  default, in most cases they are never needed.

  The DNS resolver's automatic updating of OS configuration file data
  (/etc/resolv.conf) now uses the 'domain' keyword as default search domain if
  there is no 'search' keyword.

  Own Id: OTP-8304

- Cross compilation improvements and other build system improvements.

  Most notable:

  - Lots of cross compilation improvements. The old cross compilation support
    was more or less non-existing as well as broken. Please, note that the cross
    compilation support should still be considered as experimental. Also note
    that old cross compilation configurations cannot be used without
    modifications. For more information on cross compiling Erlang/OTP see the
    `$ERL_TOP/INSTALL-CROSS.md` file.
  - Support for staged install using
    [DESTDIR](http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/DESTDIR.html). The old
    broken `INSTALL_PREFIX` has also been fixed. For more information see the
    `$ERL_TOP/INSTALL.md` file.
  - Documentation of the `release` target of the top `Makefile`. For more
    information see the `$ERL_TOP/INSTALL.md` file.
  - `make install` now by default creates relative symbolic links instead of
    absolute ones. For more information see the `$ERL_TOP/INSTALL.md` file.
  - `$ERL_TOP/configure --help=recursive` now works and prints help for all
    applications with `configure` scripts.
  - Doing `make install`, or `make release` directly after `make all` no longer
    triggers miscellaneous rebuilds.
  - Existing bootstrap system is now used when doing `make install`, or
    `make release` without a preceding `make all`.
  - The `crypto` and `ssl` applications use the same runtime library path when
    dynamically linking against `libssl.so` and `libcrypto.so`. The runtime
    library search path has also been extended.
  - The `configure` scripts of Erl_interface and ODBC now search for thread
    libraries and thread library quirks the same way as ERTS do.
  - The `configure` script of the `odbc` application now also looks for odbc
    libraries in `lib64` and `lib/64` directories when building on a 64-bit
    system.
  - The `config.h.in` file in the `erl_interface` application is now
    automatically generated in instead of statically updated which reduces the
    risk of `configure` tests without any effect.

    way.
  - Support for references, floats and term comparison.
  - Various new functions, like `enif_inspect_iolist_as_binary`,
    `enif_make_sub_binary`, `enif_get_string`, `enif_get_atom`,
    `enif_make_tuple_from_array`, `enif_make_list_from_array`,

- The documentation is now possible to build in an open source environment after
  a number of bugs are fixed and some features are added in the documentation
  build process.

  \- The arity calculation is updated.

  \- The module prefix used in the function names for bif's are removed in the
  generated links so the links will look like
  "http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#append_element-2" instead of
  "http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#erlang:append_element-2".

  \- Enhanced the menu positioning in the html documentation when a new page is
  loaded.

  \- A number of corrections in the generation of man pages (thanks to Sergei
  Golovan)

  \- The legal notice is taken from the xml book file so OTP's build process can
  be used for non OTP applications.

- There is new `erlang:binary_to_term/2` BIF that takes an option list. The
  option `safe` can be used to prevent creation of resources that are not
  garbage collected (such as atoms). (Thanks to Jayson Vantuyl.)

  Own Id: OTP-8367

- The default settings for garbage collection of binaries has been adjusted to
  be less aggressive than in R13B03. It is now also possible configure the
  settings for binary GC. See the documentation for `spawn_opt/2-5`,
  `erlang:system_info/1`, `erlang:system_flag/2`, `process_flag/2-3`,
  `erlang:trace/3`, and the documentation for `erl` for the new command line
  options `+hms` and `+hmbs`.

  Own Id: OTP-8370

- A bug causing memory corruption in re:run() has been corrected. (Thanks to
  Yamashina Hio.)

  Own Id: OTP-8375

- The `-Werror` option for `erlc` and the compiler option `warnings_as_errors`
  will cause warnings to be treated as errors. (Thanks to Christopher Faulet.)

  Own Id: OTP-8382

- Explicit top directories in archive files are now optional.

  For example, if an archive (app-vsn.ez) just contains an app-vsn/ebin/mod.beam
  file, the file info for the app-vsn and app-vsn/ebin directories are faked
  using the file info from the archive file as origin. The virtual directories
  can also be listed. For short, the top directories are virtual if they does
  not exist.

  Own Id: OTP-8387

- An unnecessary lock operation in os:timestamp/0 has been eliminated, making it
  slightly more efficient. (Thanks to Jonas Falkevik and Tuncer Ayaz.)

  Own Id: OTP-8390

- There is a new `+t` emulator option for changing the maximum number of atoms.
  (Thanks to Julien Barbot.)

  Own Id: OTP-8405

- Fixed numerous compiler warnings generated by gcc 4.4.1 and tile-cc
  2.0.1.78377 when compiling the runtime system.

  Own Id: OTP-8412

- `configure` learned the option `--enable-m32-build` to force the building of a
  32-bit run-time on systems where the default C compiler generates 64-bit
  executables by default.

  Own Id: OTP-8415

- HiPE now works in the 64-bit emulator on Mac OS X. (Thanks to Geoff Cant.)

  Own Id: OTP-8416

- Improved handling of symbolic links to escripts

  Own Id: OTP-8417

- Add lock profiling tool.

  The Lock profiling tool, lcnt, can make use of the internal lock statistics
  when the runtime system is built with this feature enabled.

  This provides a mechanism to examine potential lock bottlenecks within the
  runtime itself.

  \- Add erts_debug:lock_counters(\{copy_save, bool()\}). This option enables or
  disables statistics saving for destroyed processes and ets-tables. Enabling
  this might consume a lot of memory.

  \- Add id-numbering for lock classes which is otherwise undefined.

  Own Id: OTP-8424

- Removed spurious options to the emulator from escript.

  Own Id: OTP-8427

- Minor documentation fixes. Mainly anchor adjustments.

## Erts 5.7.4

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- An insufficient stack allocation was made when reading CPU information on BSD
  operating systems. (Thanks Michael Turner and Akira Kitada)

  Own Id: OTP-8207

- A bug when supplying an argument without a dash directly after the program
  name when starting erlang could prevent distribution to start. This is now
  corrected.

  Own Id: OTP-8209

- A ticker process could potentially be blocked indefinitely trying to send a
  tick to a node not responding. If this happened, the connection would not be
  brought down as it should.

  Own Id: OTP-8218

- Using certain firewalls (i.e. MS IAS Client and certain versions of COMODO)
  could expose an undocumented behaviour in the Win32 socket interface causing
  the name resolution calls to hang infinitely. This is now worked around by
  adding possibilities for port programs under Windows to use overlapped I/O on
  their standard input/output file handles.

  Own Id: OTP-8230

- Fixed bug on ETS tables with `write_concurrency`. The emulator could crash
  when doing a `select` or `match` with a bound key without finding any object.

  Own Id: OTP-8242

- The `information-request` / `information-response`, and
  `group-leader-change-request` / `group-leader-changed-response` signal pairs
  described below did not always adhere to the signal order guarantees of
  Erlang's signal model in the runtime system with SMP support. These signals
  could for example sometimes pass exit signals.

  The following BIFs behaviors can be modeled as if an asynchronous
  `information-request` signal is sent to `Pid`. If `Pid` is alive, it responds
  with an asynchronous `information-response` signal; otherwise, the runtime
  system responds with a `no-such-process` signal. When the response is
  received, the caller transforms it into the result of the BIF.

  - [`is_process_alive(Pid)`](`is_process_alive/1`)
  - `erlang:process_display(Pid, Type)`
  - [`process_info(Pid)`](`process_info/1`)
  - [`process_info(Pid, ItemSpec)`](`process_info/2`)

  When `Pid` resides on the same node as the caller of
  [`group_leader(GroupLeader, Pid)`](`group_leader/2`), the
  [`group_leader/2`](`group_leader/2`) BIFs behavior can be modeled as if an
  asynchronous `group-leader-change-request` signal is sent to `Pid`. If `Pid`
  is alive, it responds with an asynchronous `group-leader-changed-response`
  signal; otherwise, the runtime system responds with a `no-such-process`
  signal. When the response is received, the caller transforms it into the
  result of the BIF. The distributed case which only consists of an asynchronous
  `group-leader-change-request` signal and no response is not effected.

  Own Id: OTP-8245

- Errors in the `system_profile` documentation has been corrected.

  Own Id: OTP-8257

- Low watermark socket option modified high watermark instead of low watermark
  in the inet_driver. (Thanks to Feng Yu and Tuncer Ayaz)

  Own Id: OTP-8279

- A race condition could cause the runtime system with SMP support to end up in
  a completely unresponsive state.

  Own Id: OTP-8297

### Improvements and New Features

- The use of `pthread_cond_timedwait()` have been completely removed from the
  runtime system. This since its behavior is unpredictable when the system clock
  is suddenly changed. The previous use of it was harmless.

  Own Id: OTP-8193

- The documentation is now built with open source tools (xsltproc and fop) that
  exists on most platforms. One visible change is that the frames are removed.

  Own Id: OTP-8201

- A new garbage collecting strategy for binaries which is more aggressive than
  the previous implementation. Binaries now has a virtual binary heap tied to
  each process. When binaries are created or received to a process it will check
  if the heap limit has been reached and if a reclaim should be done. This
  imitates the behavior of ordinary Erlang terms. The virtual heaps are grown
  and shrunk like ordinary heaps. This will lessen the memory footprint of
  binaries in a system.

  Own Id: OTP-8202

- The `ErlDrvTermData` term types used by `driver_output_term()` and
  `driver_send_term()` have been extended with the term types `ERL_DRV_INT64`,
  and `ERL_DRV_UINT64` for passing 64-bit integers. Also the 64-bit integer data
  types `ErlDrvSInt64` and `ErlDrvUInt64` have been introduced.

  For more information see the [erl_driver(3)](erl_driver.md) documentation.

  Own Id: OTP-8205

- \[escript] The restriction that the first line in escripts must begin with
  `#!` has been removed.

  \[escript] Some command line options to the escript executable has now been
  documented. For example you can run an escript in the debugger by just adding
  a command line option.

  \[escript] The documentation of the escript header syntax has been clarified.
  For example the header is optional. This means that it is possible to directly
  "execute" `.erl`, `.beam` and`.zip` files.

  Own Id: OTP-8215

- The instruction for building OTP on Windows was outdated and incomplete, the
  document is updated.

  Also the otp_build script required windows drives to show up in Cygwin using
  the /cygdrive prefix. That requirement is now removed.

  Own Id: OTP-8219

- A module can have native implemented functions (NIFs) that are dynamically
  loaded by calling `erlang:load_nif/2`. This is an experimental feature that is
  not yet intended for production systems. It is released with intention to get
  some early feedback on the interfaces before they are carved in stone.

  Own Id: OTP-8220

- The [`float/1`](`float/1`) BIF would always force a garbage collection. The
  BIFs [`size/1`](`size/1`), [`byte_size/1`](`byte_size/1`),
  [`bit_size/1`](`bit_size/1`), [`abs/1`](`abs/1`), and [`round/1`](`round/1`)
  would force a garbage-collection if the result was not a sufficiently small
  integer.

  Own Id: OTP-8221

- The `erlang:port_command/3` BIF has been added. `erlang:port_command/3` is
  currently not auto imported, but it is planned to be auto imported in OTP R14.
  For more information see the `m:erlang` documentation.

  Own Id: OTP-8225

- '`configure --enable-darwin-64bit`' would fail if Snow Leopard had been booted
  with the 64-bit kernel. (Thanks to Ryan M. Graham.)

  Own Id: OTP-8236

## Erts 5.7.3

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- On Windows, open_port(\{spawn,Command\},Opts) could not run executables with
  spaces in the path or filename, regardless of quoting efforts. While
  open_port(\{spawn_executable,Exec\},Opts) can run any executable, it was still
  impossible to use 'spawn' to do the same thing. This is now corrected.

  Own Id: OTP-8055

- The scheduler bind type `processor_spread` spread schedulers too much on large
  NUMA systems.

  The new scheduler bind type `spread` spreads schedulers as much as possible,
  and behaves as `processor_spread` previously did. For more information see the
  documentation of the `+sbt` command line argument in the [erl](erl_cmd.md)
  documentation, and the documentation of
  `erlang:system_flag(scheduler_bind_type, SchedulerBindType)`.

  Own Id: OTP-8063

- Automatically detected CPU topology on Linux system could erroneously contain
  logical processors with `-1` as identifiers. This happened when
  `sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF)` returned a value larger than the amount of
  logical processors found.

  Own Id: OTP-8064

- When the minimal term [] (end of list) was sent as the complete message to a
  process on another node, and received there, it could not be decoded. This bug
  is now corrected. Fortunately [] is uncommon as the complete message in real
  applications but it is a serious bug anyway.

  Own Id: OTP-8092

- A bug when the floating point exception pointer was not initialized has been
  corrected. It manifested itself on CentOS 5.1 sometimes when a floating point
  value was sent to a remote node. Bug reported and patch suggested by David
  Reiss, confirmed by Mikael Pettersson.

  Some build problems on IRIX was also corrected. Problem reported by Patrick
  Baggett, patch by Mikael Pettersson.

  Own Id: OTP-8095

- A terminating process could erroneously unregister a name for another process.
  This could occur under the following conditions: The name of the terminating
  process was unregistered and then registered for another process
  simultaneously as the process that first had the name was terminating.

  Own Id: OTP-8099 Aux Id: seq11344

- Running erlc in a very deep directory (with a path length of more 256 or more
  characters) would cause the emulator to crash in a call to
  [`list_to_atom/1`](`list_to_atom/1`). (Thanks to Chris Newcombe.)

  Own Id: OTP-8124

- A deadlock of the runtime system could occur when unregistering the name of a
  port.

  Own Id: OTP-8145

- `Makefile.in` has been updated to use the LDFLAGS environment variable (if
  set). (Thanks to Davide Pesavento.)

  Own Id: OTP-8157

- The pthread rwlock implementation on Linux could cause starvation of writers.
  We, therefore, now use our own rwlock implementation on Linux.

  Own Id: OTP-8158

- Open source Erlang builds are updated to work well on Snow Leopard (MacOS X
  10.6)

  Own Id: OTP-8168

- A call to `erlang:system_info(schedulers_online)` could end up in an infinite
  loop. This happened if the amount of schedulers was larger than one, the
  amount of schedulers online was one, and someone was blocking
  multi-scheduling.

  Own Id: OTP-8169

- An error in erlang:system_profile/2 could cause timestamped messages to arrive
  out of order in the SMP case. This has now been fixed.

  Own Id: OTP-8171

- [`binary_to_atom/2`](`binary_to_atom/2`) and
  [`binary_to_existing_atom/2`](`binary_to_existing_atom/2`) would leak memory
  if the binary contained unaligned data.

  Own Id: OTP-8192

- The async thread pool in the runtime system without SMP support used a memory
  allocator that was not thread safe for async jobs.

  Own Id: OTP-8194

### Improvements and New Features

- Processor internal NUMA nodes are now supported in the ERTS internal CPU
  topology representation. For more information see the documentation of the
  `+sct` command line argument in the [erl](erl_cmd.md) documentation, and the
  documentation of `erlang:system_info(cpu_topology)`.

  Own Id: OTP-8041

- Documentation for ets improved about concurrency.

  Own Id: OTP-8050

- Emulator flags in an escript were earlier inherited to emulators started from
  the emulator running the escript. For example when an escript invoked
  `os:cmd("erl")`, the new emulator were given erroneous emulator flags. This
  bug has now been fixed

  Escript filenames may now contain dots.

  Own Id: OTP-8060

- Made some BIFs non-recursive (relational operators,hash and phash) to limit
  internal stack usage.

  Own Id: OTP-8065

- Fixed Windows specific bug in erl_prim_loader. Now it handles the root
  directory (e.g. c:/) better. This bug affected the directory listing in the
  debugger.

  Own Id: OTP-8080

- A TCP socket with option `{packet,4}` could crash the emulator if it received
  a packet header with a very large size value (>2Gb). The same bug caused
  `erlang:decode_packet/3` to return faulty values. (Thanks to Georgos Seganos.)

  Own Id: OTP-8102

- The maximum size of the export table has been raised from 65536 to 524288
  entries.

  Own Id: OTP-8104 Aux Id: seq11345

- The file module has now a read_line/1 function similar to the io:get_line/2,
  but with byte oriented semantics. The function file:read_line/1 works for raw
  files as well, but for good performance it is recommended to use it together
  with the 'read_ahead' option for raw file access.

  Own Id: OTP-8108

- Fixed bug causing emulator crash when reading a term in external format
  containing a corrupt list with a negative length.

  Own Id: OTP-8117

- New emulator flag `+sss`, to set stack size of scheduler threads.

  Own Id: OTP-8119

- The Windows utility Erlsrv, run in interactive mode now accepts options for
  registering internal service name and description field of Windows registry
  database.

  Own Id: OTP-8132

- `erlang:demonitor(Mon, [flush])` has been optimized. Previously it always
  searched the message queue of the caller for a `'DOWN'` message. Current
  implementation only search the message queue when necessary. It is quite
  common that the search is not necessary.

  A new option `info` has been added to `erlang:demonitor/2`. For more
  information see the `m:erlang` documentation.

  Own Id: OTP-8143

- I/O tasks could unnecessarily be rescheduled. This was harmless, but not
  useful work.

  Own Id: OTP-8148

- Minor improvements of `erlang:memory/[1,2]`.

  Own Id: OTP-8152

- New configuration option to enable use of shared zlib.

  Own Id: OTP-8155

- Fixed smp bug in ETS that could cause emulator crash when table with more than
  1000 objects accessed by several processes, including calls to variants of
  `select` or `match` combined with concurrent object deletion.

  Own Id: OTP-8166 Aux Id: seq11392

- The code path interpretation is now more relaxed. The flag -code_path_choice
  now defaults to relaxed instead of strict. See the documentation of code and
  init for more info.

  Own Id: OTP-8170

- Load balancing of run queues and check for I/O are triggered more often than
  before in situations where processes are scheduled often but are doing very
  little work each time they execute.

  Own Id: OTP-8172

- Call tracing binary comprehensions would cause an emulator crash. (Thanks to
  Paul Mineiro.)

  Own Id: OTP-8179

- [`binary_to_term/1`](`binary_to_term/1`) would crash the emulator instead of
  generating a `badarg` exception when given certain invalid terms. (Thanks to
  Scott Lystig Fritchie.)

  Own Id: OTP-8180

## Erts 5.7.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Crash dumps should now cause less problems for the crashdump_viewer
  application. (For processes where arity was non-zero, the arguments are now
  longer printed - they used to be printed in a format that was not parseable.)

  Own Id: OTP-7472 Aux Id: seq11019, 11292

- Processes could potentially get stuck on an offline scheduler.

  Own Id: OTP-7990

- [`binary_to_atom/2`](`binary_to_atom/2`) and
  [`binary_to_existing_atom/2`](`binary_to_existing_atom/2`) could leak memory
  if they caused a `badarg` exception.

  Own Id: OTP-7997

- A process could under very rare circumstances erroneously be resumed.

  Own Id: OTP-8000

- Load balancing between schedulers could under rare circumstances cause an
  emulator crash.

  Own Id: OTP-8008

- `erlang:memory(processes_used)` always returned `0` instead of the correct
  value. (Thanks to Geoff Cant)

  Own Id: OTP-8022

### Improvements and New Features

- Major improvements of the Erlang distribution for Erlang runtime systems with
  SMP support. Previously distribution port locks were heavily contended, and
  all encoding and decoding for a specific distribution channel had to be done
  in sequence. Lock contention due to the distribution is now negligible and
  both encoding and decoding of Erlang messages can be done in parallel.

  The old atom cache protocol used by the Erlang distribution has been dropped
  since it effectively prevented all parallel encoding and decoding of messages
  passed over the same distribution channel.

  A new atom cache protocol has been introduced which isolates atom cache
  accesses and makes parallel encoding and decoding of messages passed over the
  same distribution channel possible. The new atom cache protocol also use an
  atom cache size 8 times larger than before. The new atom cache protocol is
  documented in the ERTS users guide.

  Erlang messages received via the distribution are now decoded by the receiving
  Erlang processes without holding any distribution channel specific locks.
  Erlang messages and signals sent over the distribution are as before encoded
  by the sending Erlang process, but now without holding any distribution
  channel specific locks during the encoding. That is, both encoding and
  decoding can be and are done in parallel regardless of distribution channel
  used.

  The part that cannot be parallelized is the atom cache updates. Atom cache
  updates are therefore now scheduled on the distribution port. Since it is only
  one entity per distribution channel doing this work there is no lock
  contention due to the atom cache updates.

  The new runtime system does not understand the old atom cache protocol. New
  and old runtime systems can however still communicate, but no atom cache will
  be used.

  Own Id: OTP-7774

- Fixed a bug that caused error logging from `driver_select` sometimes with
  additional symptoms such as failing IP communications or even an emulator
  crash.

  Own Id: OTP-7898 Aux Id: seq11304

- Improved SMP concurrency for ETS tables. Several mutating operations can now
  be performed truly concurrent on different records of the same table. To
  support this, the table has to be created with option `write_concurrency`, as
  it is achieved at the expense of some execution and memory overhead.
  `ets:select` and `select_count` has also been improved for all tables to not
  acquire exclusive table lock during the iteration.

  Own Id: OTP-7922

- erl (that is erl.exe and dyn_erl) and erlexec has been made more dynamic so no
  hard coded paths needs to added at installation time to erl (that is erl.ini
  and erl). Reltool will make use of this in a future release.

  Own Id: OTP-7952

- Added functionality to get higher resolution timestamp from system. The
  erlang:now function returns a timestamp that's not always consistent with the
  actual operating system time (due to resilience against large time changes in
  the operating system). The function os:timestamp/0 is added to get a similar
  timestamp as the one being returned by erlang:now, but untouched by Erlangs
  time correcting and smoothing algorithms. The timestamp returned by
  os:timestamp is always consistent with the operating systems view of time,
  like the calendar functions for getting wall clock time, but with higher
  resolution. Example of usage can be found in the os manual page.

  Own Id: OTP-7971

- Two new options are added to open_port - spawn_executable which runs external
  executables in a controlled way, and spawn_driver which only opens port to
  loaded Erlang drivers. See the erlang manual page for details.

  Own Id: OTP-7995

- New functionality in ETS to transfer the ownership of a table. A table can
  either change owner be declaring an "heir", another process that will inherit
  the table if the owner terminates. A table can also change owner by calling a
  new function `ets:give_away`.

  Own Id: OTP-8006

- Updates to Tilera build environment.

  Own Id: OTP-8009

- A stack trace was unnecessarily saved during process termination.

  Own Id: OTP-8014

- User defined CPU topology and scheduler bind type can now be set from the
  command line when starting an emulator. For more information see the
  documentation of the `+sct`, and the `+sbt` emulator flags in the
  [erl](erl_cmd.md) documentation.

  The CPU topologies returned from `erlang:system_info/1` and
  `erlang:system_flag/2` now always contain the `processor` level, also when not
  strictly necessary.

  Own Id: OTP-8030

- Various fixes in ETS: `ets:first` could return a deleted key in a fixated
  table. `ets:lookup` could return objects out of order if a deleted object was
  re-inserted into a fixed bag. `ets:delete_object` could fail to delete
  duplicate objects in a duplicate_bag.

  Own Id: OTP-8040

- A message buffer memory leak in the runtime system without smp support has
  been fixed.

  Own Id: OTP-7941

- Attempting to append a binary of 16Mb or greater to another binary using the
  bit syntax would cause a `system_limit` exception. There was also several
  cases when constructing binaries when a `badarg` exception was generated when
  it should have been `system_limit`.

  Own Id: OTP-7942

- The runtime system with SMP support failed to terminate the caller of
  [`link(RemotePid)`](`link/1`) properly, if `RemotePid` was the pid of a
  process on an unreachable node. The calling process was in this case marked as
  exiting, but never terminated.

  Own Id: OTP-7946

### Improvements and New Features

- Rudimentary support for cross compiling is added to the source release. The
  support is still in its infancy and has only been used to cross compile on
  Linux for a different cpu architecture and a different Linux version, but
  should be extendible to support other platforms as well. The cross
  configuration files with examples are placed in $ERL_TOP/xcomp/. View
  README.xcomp and run $ERL_TOP/otp_build -help for further information.

  Own Id: OTP-7854

- The escape sequence `\{` which was given a new interpretation in R13A has
  retained its old meaning (the ASCII code for `{`), which means that codes
  greater than 255 have to be stated using hexadecimal characters (for example,
  `\x{AAA}`). The escape sequence `\xH` where H is a hexadecimal character
  followed by something else but a hexadecimal character is no longer valid
  (incompatibility with R13A). Character codes less than 256 can be stated using
  two hexadecimal characters (for example, `\x0D`).

  Own Id: OTP-7891 Aux Id: OTP-7855

- The [`term_to_binary/1`](`term_to_binary/1`) BIF used to be implemented with
  recursive C code, which could cause the Erlang emulator to terminate because
  of a stack overflow.

  Also fixed some minor issues in [`term_to_binary/1`](`term_to_binary/1`) and
  [`binary_to_term/1`](`binary_to_term/1`) pointed out by Matthew Dempsky.

  Own Id: OTP-7894

  FreeBSD leap-seconds are handled according to patch submitted by OpenSource
  user Kenji Rikitake. No test case covers this functionality (unsupported
  platform).

  Own Id: OTP-7609

- A corrected bug in ETS for `bag` and `duplicate_bag`. A `delete/2` or
  `lookup_element/3` could miss objects in a fixed table if one or more objects
  with the same key had already been deleted.

  Own Id: OTP-7665

- A new driver call-back `stop_select` is introduced to allow drivers to
  de-select and then close a file descriptor in a safe way in a SMP emulator.
  The old way was not strictly according to posix standard and could in some
  rare cases lead to unexpected behavior. A new flag `ERL_DRV_USE` can be passed
  to `driver_select()` to tell it that the descriptor should be closed.
  `stop_select` is then called when it is safe to do so. Old drivers will
  however still work as before.

  Own Id: OTP-7670

- A bug fixed for TCP sockets with option `{packet,http}`. An HTTP request with
  an absolute URI was returned with a corrupt path string. This bug did only

- A bug in the inet driver for SCTP on Solaris showing for e.g gen_sctp:abort/1
  and gen_sctp:eof/1 has been corrected. Patch suggestion by Simon Cornish.

  Own Id: OTP-7866

### Improvements and New Features

- The order of objects visited in select for ordered_set is now documented.

  Own Id: OTP-7339

- The runtime system with SMP support now uses multiple, scheduler specific run
  queues, instead of one globally shared run queue.

  The lock protecting the shared run queue was heavily contended, and the shared
  run queue also caused Erlang processes to randomly migrate between schedulers
  with negative cache effects as a result.

  With the current scheduler specific run queue solution, lock contention due to
  run queue protection has been reduced, and Erlang processes are only migrated
  when needed to balance the load between the schedulers. The reduced amount of
  migration also reduce lock contention on locks protecting the scheduler
  specific instances of the erts internal memory allocators.

  The scheduler specific run queues are also a necessity for a lot of future
  planned NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) specific optimizations.

- Support for Unicode is implemented as described in EEP10. Formatting and
  reading of unicode data both from terminals and files is supported by the io
  and io_lib modules. Files can be opened in modes with automatic translation to
  and from different unicode formats. The module 'unicode' contains functions
  for conversion between external and internal unicode formats and the re module
  has support for unicode data. There is also language syntax for specifying
  string and character data beyond the ISO-latin-1 range.

  The interactive shell will support input and output of unicode characters when
  the terminal and operating system supports it.

  Please see the EEP and the io/io_lib manual pages as well as the stdlib users
  guide for details.

  _I/O-protocol incompatibilities:_

  The io_protocol between io_Server and client is updated to handle protocol
  data in unicode formats. The updated protocol is now documented. The
  specification resides in the stdlib _users manual_, which is a new part of the
  manual.

  _io module incompatibilities:_

  The io:put_chars, io:get_chars and io:get_line all handle and return unicode
  data. In the case where binaries can be provided (as to io:put_chars), they
  shall be encoded in UTF-8. When binaries are returned (as by
  io:get_line/get_chars when the io_server is set in _binary mode_) the returned
  data is also _always_ encoded as UTF-8. The file module however still returns
  byte-oriented data, why file:read can be used instead of io:get_chars to read
  binary data in ISO-latin-1.

  _io_lib module incompatibilities:_

  io_lib:format can, given new format directives (i.e "~ts" and "~tc"), return
  lists containing integers larger than 255.

- The format of the string returned by `erlang:system_info(system_version)` (as
  well as the first message when Erlang is started) has changed. The string now
  contains the both the OTP version number as well as the erts version number.

  Own Id: OTP-7649

- Message passing has been further optimized for parallel execution. Serial
  message passing is slightly more expensive than before, but parallel send to a
  common receiver is much cheaper.

  Own Id: OTP-7659

- Lock contention on the atom table lock when decoding Erlang terms on the
  external format has been drastically reduced.

  Own Id: OTP-7660

- The undocumented, unsupported, and deprecated guard BIF `is_constant/1` has
  been removed.

- The Erlang process lock implementation has been improved by Mat Hostetter at
  Tilera Corporation.

  Own Id: OTP-7692

- A `{nodedown, Node}` message passed by the `net_kernel:monitor_nodes/X`
  functionality is now guaranteed to be sent after `Node` has been removed from
  the result returned by `erlang:nodes/Y`.

  Own Id: OTP-7725

- The short-circuit operators `andalso` and `orelse` no longer guarantees that
  their second argument is either `true` or `false`. As a consequence,
  `andalso`/`orelse` are now tail-recursive.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-7748

- A new BIF, `lists:keyfind/3`, has been added. It works like
  `lists:keysearch/3` except that it does not wrap the returned tuple in a
  `value` tuple in case of success. (Thanks to James Hague for suggesting this
  function.)

  Own Id: OTP-7752

- Optimization for drivers by creating small binaries direct on process heap.

  Own Id: OTP-7762

- `I bsl N` could cause the Erlang virtual machine to run of memory instead
  generating a `system_limit` if N was absurdly huge. (Thanks to Daniel
  Hedlund.)

  There would always be a garbage collection when evaluating `I bsl N` or
  `I bsr N` if `I` was a bignum.

  If `I` is an integer and `N` a bignum, `I bsl N` will now cause the correct
  `system_limit` exception instead of `bad_arith` as in earlier releases.

  If `I` is an integer and `N` a bignum, `I bsr N` will return either 0 or -1
  depending on the sign of `I` instead of causing a `bad_arith` exception as in
  earlier releases.

  Own Id: OTP-7764

- Scheduler threads can now be bound to logical processors on newer Linux and
  Solaris systems. More systems will be supported in the future.

  In some cases performance has increased drastically when binding schedulers.
  Schedulers are not bound by default, though. This since it might cause a
  performance degradation if multiple programs have bound to processors, e.g.
  multiple Erlang runtime systems. For more information see the documentation of
  `erlang:system_flag/2`.

  In order to bind scheduler threads the CPU topology need to be known. On some
  newer Linux and Solaris systems the runtime system automatically detects the
  CPU topology. If the emulator isn't able to automatically detect the CPU
  topology, the CPU topology can be defined. For more information see the
  documentation of `erlang:system_flag/2`.

  Own Id: OTP-7777

- The compiler will refuse to a compile file where the module name in the file
  differs from the output file name.

  When compiling using `erlc`, the current working directory will no be included
  in the code path (unless explicitly added using "-pa .").

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-7793

- The BIFs [`atom_to_binary/2`](`atom_to_binary/2`),
  [`binary_to_atom/2`](`binary_to_atom/2`), and
  [`binary_to_existing_atom/2`](`binary_to_existing_atom/2`) have been added.

  Own Id: OTP-7804

- The amount of schedulers online can now be changed during operation. The
  amount of schedulers online defaults to the same amount as available logical

- Erts internal dynamically allocated process and port specific data for rarely
  used data. This is used to reduce memory usage of processes and ports that do
  not use specific functionality. More functionality will be moved to process

- There are new functions `erlang:min/2` and `erlang:max/2` to calculate the
  minimum and maximum of two terms, respectively. Note that the functions are
  not auto-imported, so they need to be imported explicitly or the `erlang`
  prefix must be used when calling them.

- Enhanced build environment for cross compilation to Tilera Tile architecture.

  Support for native ethread atomics on Tilera Tile64/TilePro (Thanks to Tilera
  Corporation).

  Own Id: OTP-7852

- The escape sequences `\x` and `\{` have been assigned new interpretations
  (they used to return the ASCII code for `x` and `{` respectively). One or more
  octal characters inside curly brackets after a leading backslash is from now
  on an alternative to the existing syntax `\NNN`, but can also be used for
  codes greater than 255. In a similar fashion, one or more hexadecimal
  characters can be put inside curly brackets after a leading `\x`. Furthermore,
  the escape sequences `\xH` and `\xHH`, where N is a hexadecimal character, can
  be used for codes less than 256.

  NOTE: These new escape sequences are still considered experimental and may be
  changed in the R13B release.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

- The PCRE library's exported function names are now prefixed with erts\_ in the

## Erts 5.6.5.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- A corrected bug in ETS for `bag` and `duplicate_bag`. A `delete/2` or
  `lookup_element/3` could miss objects in a fixed table if one or more objects
  with the same key had already been deleted.

  Own Id: OTP-7665

- A bug fixed for TCP sockets with option `{packet,http}`. An HTTP request with
  an absolute URI was returned with a corrupt path string. This bug did only
  exist in R12B-4 and R12B-5.

  Own Id: OTP-7682 Aux Id: OTP-7647

- Calling `gen_tcp:send()` from several processes on socket with option
  `send_timeout` could lead to much longer timeout than specified. The solution
  is a new socket option `{send_timeout_close,true}` that will do automatic
  close on timeout. Subsequent calls to send will then immediately fail due to
  the closed connection.

- A process being garbage collected via the
  [`garbage_collect/1`](`garbage_collect/1`) BIF or the
  [`check_process_code/2`](`check_process_code/2`) BIF didn't handle message
  receive and resume correctly during the garbage collect. When this occurred,
  the process returned to the state it had before the garbage collect instead of
  entering the new state.

  Own Id: OTP-7738

## Erts 5.6.5

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- A bug in inet_drv concerning gen_tcp:connect has been corrected. A connect
  towards a non-open port through open firewalls could sometimes erroneously be
  successful. Any subsequent operation would fail, though.

- Floating point arithmetic in drivers could cause a runtime system crash and/or
  unexpected results on runtime systems with floating point exceptions enabled.
  Floating point exceptions are disabled unless explicitly enabled or if hipe is

- A bug when many sockets got signalled simultaneously causing the emulator to
  panic with the message "Inconsistent, why isn't io reported?" is now
  corrected.

  according to RFC2616.

  Own Id: OTP-7543

- An emulator compiled for SCTP now starts even if the dynamic libraries are not
  present. The SCTP driver is then of course not loaded.

  Own Id: OTP-7551

- To build on Mac OS X, 10.3.0 or later is now required because of fixes for two
  problems:

  There would be a resource leak when `erl_ddl` attempted to unload a driver.
  This problem has been corrected by using `dlopen()` (which works on all modern
  Unix-like platforms) instead of the Mac OS X specific API calls.

  Signal handling in the run-time system for HiPE has been updated to work on
  later versions of Mac OS X than 10.2.x. Therefore, `--enable-hipe` now works
  on Mac OS X with Intel CPUs.

  Thanks to Geoff Cant for the patches.

- Corrected some information about the protocol between EPMD and Erlang nodes.
  (Thanks to Michael Regen.)

- When using `erlang:system_monitor(Pid,{long_gc,Time})`, and the GC time
  exceeded 1 second, it sometimes erroneously showed up as about 4300 seconds.

  Newcombe.)

### Improvements and New Features

- The driver entry of a dynamically loaded driver is now copied when loaded
  which enables some internal optimizations. Note that drivers that modify the
  driver entry during execution will not work anymore. Such a miss-use of the
  driver interface is however not supported.

  Own Id: OTP-6900

- The split function is now added to the re library. Exceptions and errors from
  both run, replace and split are made more consistent.

  Own Id: OTP-7514 Aux Id: OTP-7494

- Fixed harmless compiler warnings when building the emulator and minor build
  changes in order to avoid unnecessary rebuilds.

  Own Id: OTP-7530

- There is now experimental support for loading of code from archive files. See
  the documentation of `code`, `init`, `erl_prim_loader `and `escript` for more
  info.

  The error handling of `escripts` has been improved.

  An `escript` may now set explicit arguments to the emulator, such as
  `-smp enabled`.

  An `escript` may now contain a precompiled beam file.

  An `escript` may now contain an archive file containing one or more
  applications (experimental).

  The internal module `code_aux` has been removed.

  Own Id: OTP-7548 Aux Id: otp-6622

- The reallocation functionality part of the ERTS internal memory allocators,
  now consider current block in combination with surrounding free blocks as an
  alternative location for a reallocation.

  Own Id: OTP-7555

- There could remain false references from a process to a module that has been
  called earlier, so that the process would be killed if the module was
  reloaded. (Thanks to Richard Carlsson.)

  Also, the fix for this bug also made it possible to make stack backtraces (as
  returned from `erlang:get_stacktrace/0` and other functions) more correct in
  that the immediate caller is always included in the stack backtrace (it could
  sometimes be missing).

  Own Id: OTP-7559

- Improved locking in IO-handling for better smp performance.

  Own Id: OTP-7560

- Improved BIF rescheduling functionality.

  Own Id: OTP-7587

- Loading a module compiled with Erlang/OTP R9C and calling `module_info/0` in
  the module would crash the emulator. The emulator now refuses to load any
  module compiled with R9C or earlier. (Note: only trivial modules compiled with
  R10B or earlier could be loaded anyway.) (Thanks to Martin Kjellin.)

  Own Id: OTP-7590

## Erts 5.6.4.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- A process calling one of the following BIFs could under very rare conditions
  deadlock in the runtime system with SMP support:
  [`check_process_code/2`](`check_process_code/2`),
  [`garbage_collect/1`](`garbage_collect/1`), `process_info/[1,2]`,
  `system_flag/2`, and `erlang:suspend_process/[1,2]`.

  Own Id: OTP-7582

- A couple of statistics variables were not managed in a thread safe manner in
  the runtime system with SMP support.

  Own Id: OTP-7583

- An extremely rare race condition when terminating a process could potentially
  cause a runtime system crash.

  Own Id: OTP-7584

- Under certain conditions and when using run_erl/to_erl, the terminal Erlang
  driver (ttsl_drv) could crash the emulator by doing a division by zero due to
  incorrect handling of terminals reporting a zero width. For terminals
  reporting zero width, the driver now fallbacks to a default width of 80 and a
  default height of 24 (vt100), as a fallback behaviour. This fixes the crashes
  and also makes output on "dumb" terminals much more readable.

  Own Id: OTP-7592 Aux Id: seq11073

## Erts 5.6.4.1

### Improvements and New Features

- A new `erts_alloc` parameter `+M<S>rmbcmt` (relative multiblock carrier move
  threshold) has been added. It determines when to force a moving realloc in a
  multiblock carrier when a block is shrunk. For more information see the
  `erts_alloc(3)` documentation.

  Own Id: OTP-7540

- The new option `+d` can be given to `erl` to suppress the crash dump
  generation if an internal error is detected. As a result, a more useful core
  dump is produced.

  Own Id: OTP-7578 Aux Id: seq11052

## Erts 5.6.4

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Double backslashes in format string passed to the erts internal printf
  implementation produced erroneous results. No such format strings were passed
  to the erts internal printf implementation, i.e., the bug was therefore
  completely harmless. (Thanks to Perry Smith.)

  Own Id: OTP-7408

- Large files are now handled on Windows, where the filesystem supports it.

  Own Id: OTP-7410

- Bug fixed for `{packet,http}` when space follows http headers.

  Own Id: OTP-7458

- The trace option `running` could cause an emulator crash if the current
  function couldn't be determined.

  Own Id: OTP-7484

- Using 16#ffffFFFF as a timeout value in receive...after would often cause a
  timeout almost at once due to an 32-bit integer overflow. (Thanks to Serge
  Aleynikov and Matthias Lang.)

  Own Id: OTP-7493

- For the process that an escript runs in, the `trap_exit` process flag is now
  `false` instead of `true` (as in previous releases). Scripts that depend on
  the previous (counter-intuitive) behaviour might not work. (Thanks to Bengt
  Kleberg.)

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-7517

- A bug in the `string:to_integer/1` builtin made the emulator unstable. This is
  now corrected. (Thanks to Lev Walkin.)

  Own Id: OTP-7526

### Improvements and New Features

- Performance for ETS intensive applications should now be better in the SMP
  emulator. Also, ETS table identifiers (as returned by `ets:new/2`) are now
  spread out in wider range than before (using 28 bits in a 32-bit emulator) to
  make sure that the table identifier for a deleted table will not be quickly
  re-used.

  NOTE: Table identifiers can now be negative integers. Programs that
  (incorrectly) assume that table identifiers can only be positive integers
  might stop to work. (The type of a table identifier is intentionally not
  documented, and may change in a future release.)

  Own Id: OTP-7348

- New BIF `erlang:decode_packet/3` that extracts a protocol packet from a
  binary. Similar to the socket option `{packet, Type}`. Also documented the
  socket packet type `http` and made it official. _NOTE_: The tuple format for
  `http` packets sent from an active socket has been changed in an incompatible
  way.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-7404

- The source code for the documentation for some applications (erts, kernel,
  stdlib, and several others) are now included in the source tar ball. There is
  currently no Makefile support for building HTML files from the source (such
  support will be included in a future release).

  Own Id: OTP-7406

- A lot of frequently accessed memory counters (erts internal) have been
  removed. This since they hurt performance on the runtime system with SMP
  support. As a result `erlang:memory/[0,1]` will only deliver a result if all
  `erts_alloc(3)` allocators are enabled (default). The result delivered when
  all `erts_alloc(3)` allocators are enabled are both more accurate and less
  accurate than before. More memory than before are included in the result, but
  the different parts that are summed are not gathered atomically. A call to
  `erlang:memory/[0,1]` is much cheaper for the system than before. This since
  the information isn't gathered atomically anymore which was very expensive.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-7468

- Pre-allocators used for, for example, timers, and messages have been rewritten
  to be scheduler specific. That is, different schedulers will now allocate from
  different pools which reduces lock contention.

  Own Id: OTP-7470

- On Mac OS X, file:sync/1 now guarantees that all filesystem buffers are
  written to the disk by using the fcntl() with F_FULLFSYNC option. Previously,
  file:sync/1 called fsync(), which only guaranteed that the data had been
  transferred to the disk drive. (Thanks to Jan Lehnardt.)

  Own Id: OTP-7471

- Termination of a process that takes a long time can now be preempted, i.e.,
  the terminating process will be rescheduled for later continuation of
  termination so that other processes can execute. Termination of a process that
  owns many and/or large ets tables typically takes a long time.

  Own Id: OTP-7477

- A new trace option `exiting` has been added. The `exiting` trace is similar to
  the `running` trace, but for exiting processes. For more information see the
  erlang(3) documentation.

  The `erlang:trace/3` bif now doesn't block other scheduler threads if only one
  tracee is specified in the call to `erlang:trace/3`.

  Own Id: OTP-7481

- The re module is extended with repetitive matches (global option) and
  replacement function.

  Own Id: OTP-7494 Aux Id: OTP-7181

- In the section about binary construction, the reference manual now mentions
  what happens when an integer value does not fit into an integer segment of
  size N (namely, that the N least significant bits will be put into the binary
  and that the most significant bits will be silently discarded). (Thanks to
  Edwin Fine.)

  Own Id: OTP-7506

- Setting the `{active,once}` for a socket (using inets:setopts/2) is now
  specially optimized (because the `{active,once}` option is typically used much
  more frequently than other options).

  Own Id: OTP-7520

### Known Bugs and Problems

- Floating point arithmetic in drivers can cause a runtime system crash and/or
  unexpected results on runtime systems with floating point exceptions enabled.
  Floating point exceptions are disabled unless explicitly enabled or if hipe is
  enabled.

  Own Id: OTP-7237

## Erts 5.6.3.3

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Binary construction with an integer field of size 0 at the end of the
  constructed binary (and the size given in a variable), would cause a write of
  one byte outside the memory reserved for the binary, which in turn could cause
  an emulator crash.

  Own Id: OTP-7422

- A race condition in the dynamic driver implementation could cause an emulator
  crash. (Thanks to Paul Fisher)

  Own Id: OTP-7474

- The `env` option to `open_port()` could cause the runtime system with SMP
  support to crash.

  Own Id: OTP-7475

### Improvements and New Features

- Operations that needed to block other threads in the runtime system with SMP
  support unnecessarily waited for async threads to block. Most important the
  `erlang:memory/[0,1]` bif, code loading, and the `erlang:trace/3` bif.

  Own Id: OTP-7480

- On Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard), sending to socket which the other end closes could
  cause the emulator to consume 100% CPU time. (Thanks to Matthias Radestock.)

  Own Id: OTP-7289

- The vanilla driver used on Windows could crash the emulator and sometimes
  produced corrupt files. The vanilla driver is the driver that is used when one
  only pass a filename as first argument to [`open_port/2`](`open_port/2`).
  _NOTE_: This use of [`open_port/2`](`open_port/2`) is _obsolete_, and the
  documentation of this use has previously been removed. The functionality is
  only present for backward compatibility reasons and _will_ eventually be
  removed.

  Own Id: OTP-7301

- Faulty matching in binaries larger than 512Mb on 64bit machines fixed.(On

- A race condition in the runtime system with SMP support causing an erroneous
  removal of a newly created ets table has been fixed.

  The race occurred when a process removed a table during termination
  simultaneously as another process removed the same table via `ets:delete/1`
  and a third process created a table that accidentally got the same internal
  table index as the table being removed.

- The maximum length of an atom of 255 characters is now strictly enforced.
  [`binary_to_term/1`](`binary_to_term/1`) will now fail with a badarg if an

- A bug in "bignum handling" on some 64bit architectures could cause rem and div
  operations on large numbers to hang indefinitely. Rem operations involving the

- When doing the initial garbage collection after waking a hibernated process, a
  fullsweep garbage collection was unnecessarily triggered.

  Own Id: OTP-7212

- The beta testing module `gen_sctp` now supports active mode as stated in the
  documentation. Active mode is still rather untested, and there are some issues
  about what should be the right semantics for `gen_sctp:connect/5`. In
  particular: should it be blocking or non-blocking or choosable. There is a
  high probability it will change semantics in a (near) future patch.

- Invalid arguments to `ets:update_counter/3` were not handled correctly. A
  tuple position (`Pos`) less than 1 caused the element directly following the
  key to be updated (as if no position at all had been specified). All invalid
  values for `Pos` will now fail with `badarg`.

  `debug_compiled` arguments. For more info see the, `m:erlang` documentation.

  The scale factor returned by `test_server:timetrap_scale_factor/0` is now also
  effected if the emulator uses a larger amount of scheduler threads than the
  amount of logical processors on the system.

- A new BIF ets:update_element/3. To update individual elements within an
  ets-tuple, without having to read, update and write back the entire tuple.

  Own Id: OTP-7200

- A process executing the `processes/0` BIF can now be preempted by other
  processes during its execution. This in order to disturb the rest of the
  system as little as possible. The returned result is, of course, still a
  consistent snapshot of existing processes at a time during the call to
  `processes/0`.

  The documentation of the `processes/0` BIF and the
  [`is_process_alive/1`](`is_process_alive/1`) BIF have been updated in order to
  clarify the difference between an existing process and a process that is
  alive.

  Erlang runtime system. This since there was a need for usage of features
  introduced in Windows 2000.

  Own Id: OTP-7086

- Memory management improvements especially for the runtime system with SMP
  support:

  - The runtime system with SMP support can now use multiple, thread specific
    instances of most memory allocators. This improves performance since it
    reduces lock contention in the memory allocators. It may however increase
    memory usage for some applications. The runtime system with SMP support will
    by default enable this feature on most allocators. The amount of instances
    used can be configured.
  - `driver_alloc()`, `driver_realloc()`, and `driver_free()` now use their own
    erts specific memory allocator instead of the default `malloc()`
    implementation on the system.
  - The default configuration of some allocators have been changed to fit
    applications that use much memory better.
  - Some new `erts_alloc` configuration parameters have been added.
  - `erts_alloc_config` has been modified to be able to create configurations
    suitable for multiple instances of allocators.
  - The returned value from `erlang:system_info({allocator, Alloc})` has been
    changed. This since an allocator may now run in multiple instances.

  If you for some reason want the memory allocators to be configured as before,
  you can pass the `+Mea r11b` command-line argument to `erl`.

  For more information see the `erts_alloc(3)`, the `m:erts_alloc_config`, and
  the `m:erlang` documentation.

- When the runtime system failed to allocate memory for binaries, it could dead
  lock while writing the `erl_crash.dump`.

  Own Id: OTP-6848

- The runtime system with SMP support could deadlock if a process called the
  `erlang:suspend_process(Pid)` BIF or the `erlang:garbage_collect(Pid)` BIF
  while the process identified by `Pid` was currently running and the process
  calling the BIFs was terminated during the call to the BIFs.

  Processes suspending each other via the `erlang:suspend_process/1` BIF or
  garbage collecting each other via the `erlang:garbage_collect/1` BIF could
  deadlock each other when the runtime system with SMP support was used.

  Own Id: OTP-6920

- `dbg` could leave traced processes in a suspended state if the tracer process
  was killed with exit reason `kill`.

  `erlang:suspend_process/2` has been introduced which accepts an option list as
  second argument. For more information see the `m:erlang` documentation.

  Processes suspended via `erlang:suspend_process/[1,2]` will now be
  automatically resumed if the process that called
  `erlang:suspend_process/[1,2]` terminates.

  Processes could previously be suspended by one process and resumed by another
  unless someone was tracing the suspendee. This is _not_ possible anymore. The
  process resuming a process _has_ to be the one that suspended it.

- file:write_file/3, file:write/2 and file:read/2 could crash (contrary to
  documentation) for odd enough file system problems, e.g write to full file
  system. This bug has now been corrected.

  In this process the file module has been rewritten to produce better error
  codes. Posix error codes now originate from the OS file system calls or are
  generated only for very similar causes (for example 'enomem' is generated if a
  memory allocation fails, and 'einval' is generated if the file handle in
  Erlang is a file handle but currently invalid).

  More Erlang-ish error codes are now generated. For example `{error,badarg}` is
  now returned from `file:close/1` if the argument is not of a file handle type.
  See file(3).

  The possibility to write a single byte using `file:write/2` instead of a list
  or binary of one byte, contradictory to the documentation, has been removed.

  the actual heaps and/or stacks were huge.

  As of erts version 5.6 the `large_heap` option to
  `erlang:system_monitor/[1,2]` has been modified. The monitor message is sent
  if the sum of the sizes of all memory blocks allocated for all heap
  generations is equal to or larger than the specified size. Previously the

- The `ErlDrvTermData` term types used by `driver_output_term()` and
  `driver_send_term()` have been extended with the term types
  `ERL_DRV_BUF2BINARY`, `ERL_DRV_EXT2TERM`, and `ERL_DRV_UINT`.
  `ERL_DRV_BUF2BINARY` is used for passing and creating a binary,
  `ERL_DRV_EXT2TERM` is used for passing terms encoded with the external term
  format, and `ERL_DRV_UINT` is used for passing unsigned integers.

  Also the data types `ErlDrvUInt` and `ErlDrvSInt` have been added which makes
  it more obvious how arguments to term types are interpreted with regards to
  width and signedness.

  The incorrect data types `ErlDriverTerm`, `ErlDriverBinary`, and
  `ErlDriverPort` in the `erl_driver(3)` documentation have been replaced with
  the correct data types `ErlDrvTermData`, `ErlDrvBinary`, and `ErlDrvPort`.

- Miscellaneous improvements of the erts internal thread library.

  It now support optimized atomic operations and spin-locks on windows.

  Fall-backs based on mutexes and/or spin-locks for missing optimized atomic
  operations, spin-locks, or rwlocks has been implemented. This makes it
  possible to compile the runtime system with SMP support on a lot more
  platforms.

  Default stack size on OpenBSD has been increased to 256 kilo-words.

- Many bit syntax operations, both construction and matching, are faster. For
  further information, see the Efficiency Guide.

  Own Id: OTP-6838

- Literal lists, tuples, and binaries are no longer constructed at run-time as
  they used to be, but are stored in a per-module constant pool. Literals that
  are used more than once are stored only once.

  This is not a change to the language, only in the details of its
  implementation. Therefore, the implications of this change is described in the
  Efficiency Guide.

  Example 1: In the expression
  [`element(BitNum-1, {1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128})`](`element/2`), the tuple used to
  be constructed every time the expression was executed, which could be
  detrimental to performance in two ways if the expression was executed in a
  loop: the time to build the tuple itself and the time spent in garbage
  collections because the heap filled up with garbage faster.

  Example 2: Literal strings, such as `"abc"`, used to be stored in the compiled
  code compactly as a byte string and expanded to a list at run-time. Now all
  strings will be stored expanded to lists (such as `[$a,$b,$c]`) in the
  constant pool. That means that the string will be faster to use at run-time,
  but that it will require more space even when not used. If space is an issue,
  you might want to use binary literals (that is, `<<"abc">>`) instead of string
  literals for infrequently used long strings (such as error messages).

- Significant improvements of the `process_info` BIFs:

  - [`process_info/2`](`process_info/2`) can now be called with a list of items
    as second argument in order to atomically retrieve information about
    multiple items.
  - `process_info/[1,2]` has been optimized in the runtime system with SMP
    support. The whole scheduler could previously be blocked for a significant
    period of time in `process_info/[1,2]` waiting for a lock on the process
    being inspected. The Erlang process calling `process_info/[1,2]` can still
    be blocked for a significant period of time waiting for the lock, but the
    scheduler will now be able to run other processes while the process calling
    `process_info/[1,2]` waits for the lock.
  - [`process_info/2`](`process_info/2`) now accept a few more items than
    before.
  - The documentation of `process_info/[1,2]` has been improved.

- Two new guard BIFs have been introduced as a recommended replacement for
  [`size/1`](`size/1`). (The [`size/1`](`size/1`) BIF will be removed no earlier
  than in R14B.) The BIFs are [`tuple_size/1`](`tuple_size/1`) to calculate the
  size of a tuple and [`byte_size/1`](`byte_size/1`) to calculate the number of
  bytes needed for the contents of the binary or bitstring (rounded up to the
  nearest number of bytes if necessary).

  There is also a new [`bit_size/1`](`bit_size/1`) BIF that returns the exact
  number of bits that a binary or bitstring contains.

  Own Id: OTP-6902

- The `ets:fixtable/2` function, which has been deprecated for several releases,
  has been removed.

  The `ets:info/1` function has been reimplemented as a BIF, which guarantees

  The `ets:info/2` function now fails with reason `badarg` if the second
  argument is invalid. (Dialyzer can be used to find buggy code where the second
  argument is misspelled.)

- The functions io:columns/0, io:columns/1, io:rows/0 and io:rows/1 are added to
  allow the user to get information about the terminal geometry. The shell takes
  some advantage of this when formatting output. For regular files and other
  io-devices where height and width are not applicable, the functions return
  \{error,enotsup\}.

  Potential incompatibility: If one has written a custom io-handler, the handler
  has to either return an error or take care of io-requests regarding terminal
  height and width. Usually that is no problem as io-handlers, as a rule of
  thumb, should give an error reply when receiving unknown io-requests, instead
  of crashing.

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Creating a named table using `ets:new/2` or renaming a named table using

  `ets:delete/1` used on a named table now removes the name immediately so that
  a new table with the same name can be created.

  Turning on call trace on the internal BIF that implements `ets:delete/1` would
  crash the emulator.

  SMP emulator only: Using `ets:rename/2` on a table that `ets:safe_fixtable/2`

- In bit syntax matching, integer fields with greater size than 16Mb would fail
  to match. (Thanks to Bertil Karlsson and Francesco Pierfederici.)

  Matching out a 32-bit integer not aligned on a byte boundary from a binary

  A module that contained bit syntax construction with a literal field size
  greater than 16Mb would fail to load.

  Several other similar bugs having to do with huge field sizes were eliminated.

  Attempting to construct a binary longer than 536870911 bytes will now fail

  construct an binary with incorrect contents). Similarly, attempting to match a
  binary longer than 536870911 bytes will now fail (instead of producing an
  incorrect result). This limitation has been documented in the Efficiency
  Guide. (The limit is in the 32-bit emulator; use the 64-bit emulator if you
  need to handle larger binaries than 536870911.)

- `erlang:system_info({allocator, Alloc})` didn't allocate enough heap when a
  bignum was part of the result which could cause an emulator crash.

  Own Id: OTP-6693

- It was previously not possible to pass `erts_alloc` the same configuration via
  the command-line, as used by default.

  A `+M*` command-line argument that configure a size of some sort can now be
  passed a value that equals the size of the address space. The value used, in
  this case, will be `"the size of the address space" - 1`.

  Own Id: OTP-6699

- `SysIOVec* driver_peekq(ErlDrvPort port, int *vlen)` did not update `*vlen` if
  `port` was invalid. `*vlen` is now set to `-1` if the `port` is invalid.

  The `efile` driver expects `*vlen` to be updated also when the `port` is
  invalid. This situation occurs seldom, but when the runtime system has
  async-threads enabled and ports are killed it can. When it occurred the
  runtime system crashed.

### Improvements and New Features

- For scripts written using `escript`, there is a new function
  `escript:script_name/0`, which can be used to retrieve the pathame of the

## Erts 5.5.4.3

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- [`process_flag(trap_exit, Bad)`](`process_flag/2`) where `Bad` was a term not
  equal to `true` or `false`, didn't fail with `badarg` as it should; instead,
  the failure was silently ignored. This bug was introduced in `erts-5.5.2`.

  Own Id: OTP-6627 Aux Id: OTP-6160

- The minimum and default stack size for async-threads has been increased to 16

## Erts 5.5.4.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- When a port steals control over a file descriptor from another port, the
  stealing port tests if the other port is alive. This in order to be able to
  give an accurate error message. In the runtime system with SMP support, this
  test was done without appropriate locks held. This could in worst case lead to
  an erroneous error message; therefore, this bug is to be considered harmless.

  Own Id: OTP-6602

### Improvements and New Features

- The default stack size for threads in the async-thread pool has been shrunk to
  8 kilowords, i.e., 32 KB on 32-bit architectures. This small default size has
  been chosen since the amount of async-threads might be quite large. The
  default stack size is enough for drivers delivered with Erlang/OTP, but might
  not be sufficiently large for other dynamically linked in drivers that use the
  `driver_async()` functionality. A suggested stack size for threads in the
  async-thread pool can be configured via the `+a` command line argument of
  [erl](erl_cmd.md).

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Setting the time on the system while using heart on a linux machine where the
  emulator was built with clock_gettime support (default from Linux
  2.6/erts-5.5.4 and upwards), could make the heart command fire. This was due
  to bug in the heart executable which is now corrected.

  Own Id: OTP-6433

- The MD5 calculation of a BEAM file done by `code:module_md5/1`,
  `beam_lib:md5/1`, and by the compiler for the default value of the `vsn`
  attribute have all been changed so that its result will be the same on all
  platforms; modules containing funs could get different MD5s on different
  platforms.

  Own Id: OTP-6459

- The emulator could dump core while writing an `erl_crash.dump` file if there
  were funs with a large terms in its environment. Since there is no way to
  inspect a fun's environment in the crashdump_viewer application anyway, a
  variables in the environment are now set to [] before dumping the fun. (Thanks
  to Jean-Sebastien Pedron.)

  Own Id: OTP-6504

- `{Port, {exit_status, S}}` messages from ports opened with the `exit_status`
  option could under rare circumstances be delayed. This bug was present on
  Erlang runtime systems without SMP support on all unix operating systems other
  than SunOS.

  Own Id: OTP-6528

- A bug in linuxthreads could cause the emulator to dump core when dlerror() was
  called before the first call to dlopen(). As a workaround the emulator always
  makes a call to dlopen() on initialization when linuxthreads is used as thread
  library.

  Own Id: OTP-6530

- file:sync/1 did not do anything on Windows. Now it calls the system function
  for flushing buffers (FlushFileBuffers()). (Thanks to Matthew Sackman.)

  Own Id: OTP-6531

- [`open_port/2`](`open_port/2`) could on the runtime system with SMP support
  fail with the wrong exit reason when a port couldn't be created. When this
  happened the exit reason was typically `eintr`, or `ebusy` instead of
  `eagain`.

  Own Id: OTP-6536

- The file driver (efile_drv) did not flush data written using the option
  'delayed_write' after the set timeout time, rather at the next file operation.
  This bug has now been corrected.

  Own Id: OTP-6538

### Improvements and New Features

- An interface towards the SCTP Socket API Extensions has been implemented.It is
  an Open Source patch courtesy of Serge Aleynikov and Leonid Timochouk. The
  Erlang code parts has been adapted by the OTP team, changing the Erlang API
  somewhat.

  The Erlang interface consists of the module `gen_sctp` and an include file
  `-include_lib("kernel/include/inet_sctp.hrl").` for option record definitions.
  The `gen_sctp` module is documented.

  The delivered Open Source patch, before the OTP team rewrites, was written
  according to http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctpsocket-13 and was
  claimed to work fine, tested on Linux Fedora Core 5.0 (kernel 2.6.15-2054 or
  later) and on Solaris 10 and 11. The OTP team rewrites used the same standard
  document but might have accidentally broken some functionality. If so it will
  soon be patched to working state. The tricky parts in C and the general design
  has essentially not changed. During the rewrites the code was hand tested on
  SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 10, and briefly on Solaris 10. Feedbach on code
  and docs is very much appreciated.

  The SCTP interface is in beta state. It has only been hand tested and has no
  automatic test suites in OPT meaning everything is most certainly not tested.
  Socket active mode is broken. IPv6 is not tested. The documentation has been
  reworked due to the API changes, but has not been proofread after this.

  Thank you from the OTP team to Serge Aleynikov and Leonid Timochouk for a
  valuable contribution. We hope we have not messed it up too much.

  Own Id: OTP-6336

- A `{minor_version,Version}` option is now recognized by
  [`term_to_binary/2`](`term_to_binary/2`). \{minor_version,1\} will cause
  floats to be encoded in an exact and more space-efficient way compared to the
  previous encoding.

  Own Id: OTP-6434

- There is a new `escript` program that can be used for writing scripts in
  Erlang. Erlang scripts don't need to be compiled and any arguments can be
  passed to them without risk that they are interpreted by the Erlang system.

  Own Id: OTP-6505

- Setting and getting socket options in a "raw" fashion is now allowed. Using
  this feature will inevitably produce non portable code, but will allow setting
  ang getting arbitrary uncommon options on TCP stacks that do have them.

  Own Id: OTP-6519

- Miscellaneous signal handling improvements on the Erlang runtime system with
  SMP support.

  The fallback implementation of spin locks and atomic operations are now
  implemented using pthread spin locks when pthread spin locks are found on the
  system.

  The Erlang runtime system with SMP support can now run on Linux systems that
  has Linuxthreads instead of NPTL (Native POSIX Thread Library). Note that the
  SMP support hasn't been as thoroughly tested with Linuxthreads as with NPTL. A
  runtime system with SMP support will therefore not be built by default on
  Linux when NPTL isn't found. In order to force a build of the runtime system
  with SMP support, pass `--enable-smp-support` to `configure` when building
  OTP.

## Erts 5.5.3.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- `erlang:system_flag(multi_scheduling, block)` could cause the emulator with
  SMP support to deadlock.

  Own Id: OTP-6431 Aux Id: OTP-6403

- The runtime system with SMP support failed to call the driver timeout callback
  of ports in state closing. This could cause ports to fail flushing their I/O
  queues.

  Own Id: OTP-6432

- The `{Port, closed}` message from a closed port could arrive at the port owner
  before `Port` had been removed from the result of `erlang:ports/0` in the
  runtime system with SMP support.

  Own Id: OTP-6437

- The async id of async jobs created via `driver_async` wasn't created in a
  thread safe manner in the runtime system with SMP support. This could in worst
  case cause `driver_async_cancel()` to cancel another async job than intended.

  Own Id: OTP-6438

- Under rare circumstances a terminating connection between two nodes could
  cause an instantaneous reconnect between the two nodes to fail on the runtime
  system with SMP support.

  Own Id: OTP-6447

- In the documentation of the driver entry field `extended_marker` of erts
  version 5.5.3 (`driver_entry(3)`), the following is stated: "The following
  fields are ignored if this field is equal to `0`". This is a documentation bug
  and has been changed to: "If this field is equal to `0`, all the fields
  following this field also _have_ to be `0`, or `NULL` in case it is a pointer
  field".

  The runtime check for detection of old incompatible drivers made when loading
  drivers has been improved. The emulator can, however, not make sure that a
  driver that doesn't use the extended driver interface isn't incompatible.
  Therefore, when loading a driver that doesn't use the extended driver
  interface, there is a risk that it will be loaded also when the driver is
  incompatible. When the driver use the extended driver interface, the emulator
  can verify that it isn't of an incompatible driver version. You are therefore
  advised to use the extended driver interface.

  For more information see the `erl_driver(3)` and `driver_entry(3)`
  documentation.

  Own Id: OTP-6452 Aux Id: OTP-6330

- When terminating ports on the runtime system with SMP support, removal of
  links to processes was done without locking the link lock on processes. This
  could cause an emulator crash.

- The emulator with SMP support could crash when a port flushed its I/O queue by
  calling `driver_async()` from the timeout driver callback.

  Own Id: OTP-6521

### Improvements and New Features

- Faster system calls for keeping the time accurate are used on newer Linux
  kernels, which can result in a significant speed-up of the emulator on those
  systems.

  Own Id: OTP-6430

- Added number of async threads and number of scheduler threads to the system
  information that can be retrieved via `driver_system_info()`. For more
  information see the `erl_driver(3)` documentation.

  Own Id: OTP-6440

- When `SIGUSR1` is received by the runtime system with SMP support, the
  `erl_crash.dump` is now written by a special thread, instead of as before
  directly from the signal handler.

  Own Id: OTP-6465

- term_to_binary/2 with compression is now faster.

  term_to_binary/2 now accepts the option '`{compressed,Level}`' for specifying
  the compression level. `Level` must be in the range 0 (no compression) through
  9 (highest compression level). Default is 6.

  Future compatibility bugfix: binary_to_term/1 did not handle the `Uniq` and
  `Index` fields correctly.

  Own Id: OTP-6494

- Removed unnecessary reallocation when initializing kernel-poll set.

  Own Id: OTP-6516

## Erts 5.5.3

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Node and fun table entries could under rare circumstances be deallocated
  multiple times on the emulator with SMP support.

  Own Id: OTP-6369

- epoll_wait() can repeat entries for the same file descriptor in the result
  array. This could cause the ready_input, ready_output, or event callbacks of a
  driver to unintentionally be called multiple times. We have only noted
  repeated entries when an error condition has occurred on the file descriptor.
  In this case, the repeated entries should normally not be a problem for the
  driver since it should detect the error and de-select the file descriptor.
  Therefore this bug should be considered harmless. The emulator now coalesce
  repeated entries into one.

  You are only affected by this bug if you are using erts-5.5.2.\* and the
  kernel-poll feature on linux.

  Own Id: OTP-6376 Aux Id: OTP-6222

- If a process that was waiting in gen_tcp:accept/1 was killed, calling

- The R10B compiler could generate unsafe `bs_save/bs_restore` instructions that
  could cause memory corruption. (The R11B compiler does not have that problem.)
  The erlang emulator will now refuse to load R10B-compiled modules that contain
  such unsafe `bs_save/bs_restore` instructions. In addition, the beam_validator
  module in the compiler will also reject such instructions (in case it is used
  to validate R10B code). (Thanks to Matthew Reilly.)

- Process and port timers could fail to work properly on the runtime system with
  SMP support. Many thanks to Dmitriy Kargapolov and Serge Aleynikov who tracked
  down this bug.

  Own Id: OTP-6387

- Bit syntax code compiled by an R10B compiler that matched out a floating point
  number would not properly check that the floating point number was valid; if
  the float was, for instance, NaN the emulator could crash.

  Own Id: OTP-6395

- statistics(runtime) on Windows used to return the elapsed system time for the
  process, instead of the user time. Corrected. (Thanks to Robert Virding.)

  Own Id: OTP-6407

- A loadable driver (loaded by erl_ddll) which used driver_async() would cause
  the emulator to crash. (Thanks to Dmitriy Kargapolov.)

  Own Id: OTP-6410

- Under rare circumstances the emulator on unix platforms could fail to
  terminate the Erlang port corresponding to a port program opened with the
  `exit_status` option.

  Own Id: OTP-6411

- A link removed via [`unlink/1`](`unlink/1`) could under rare circumstances
  transfer exit signals for a short period of time after the call to
  [`unlink/1`](`unlink/1`) had returned when the runtime system with SMP support
  was used.

  Own Id: OTP-6425 Aux Id: OTP-6160

### Improvements and New Features

- In the runtime system with SMP support, ports are now being scheduled on the
  scheduler threads interleaved with processes instead of being run in a
  separate I/O thread.

  Own Id: OTP-6262

- More interfaces are added in erl_ddll, to support different usage scenarios.

  Own Id: OTP-6307 Aux Id: OTP-6234

- In the runtime system with SMP support, the global I/O lock has been replaced
  with a more fine grained port locking scheme. Port locking is either done on
  driver level, i.e., all ports executing the same driver share a lock, or on
  port level, i.e., each port has its own lock. Currently the inet driver, the
  efile driver, and the spawn driver use port level locking and all other
  statically linked in drivers use driver level locking. By default dynamically
  linked in drivers will use locking on driver level. For more information on
  how to enable port level locking see the `erl_driver(3)` and the
  `driver_entry(3)` man pages.

  As of erts version 5.5.3 the driver interface has been extended. The extended
  interface introduce version management, the possibility to pass capability
  flags to the runtime system at driver initialization, and some new driver API
  functions. For example, the `driver_system_info()` function which can be used
  to determine if the driver is run in a runtime system with SMP support or not.
  The extended interface doesn't have to be used, _but_ dynamically linked in
  driver _have_ to be recompiled. For information see the `erl_driver(3)` and
  the `driver_entry(3)` man pages.

  _NOTE:_ Dynamically linked in drivers _have_ to be recompiled.

- The version of zlib (http://zlib.net) linked into run-time system has been
  updated to version 1.2.3.

  Own Id: OTP-6394

- The `erlc` program now passes on the `-smp` and `-hybrid` options to the
  Erlang emulator it starts. This is mainly useful for compiling native code,
  because native code must be compiled with same type of run-time system as in
  which it will be run.

  If the `-s` option is given, `erlc` now prints a warning that it is deprecated
  and that it will be removed in R12B.

  Own Id: OTP-6398

- The `schedulers` option of `erlang:system_flag/2` has been removed, i.e., the
  number of scheduler threads cannot be changed after emulator boot time any
  more.

  A `multi_scheduling` option has been added to `erlang:system_flag/2`. This
  option can be used for blocking and unblocking multi-scheduling. For more
  information see the `m:erlang` documentation.

  Own Id: OTP-6403

- A port program that had been started with the `exit_status` option and closed
  one of the pipes used for communication with the emulator caused the emulator
  to continuously poll for termination of the port program. This only became a
  problem when the emulator didn't have other things to do and the port program
  closed a pipe much earlier than it terminated. When the emulator had other
  things to do, such as running Erlang processes, the emulator polled for
  termination in between scheduling of processes.

  Now the emulator doesn't poll for termination of the port program at all;
  instead, it waits for the child signal from the terminated port program to
  arrive and then schedules the Erlang port for termination.

  The termination of any port programs have also been optimized. Previously the
  termination of any port program did always cause a scan of a table of the size
  equal to maximum number of file descriptors. If the maximum number of file
  descriptors was large, this scan could be quite expensive. Now the search have
  been reduced to the set of ports started with the `exit_status` option.

  Note, all of the above only applies to Erlang emulators on Unix platforms.

## Erts 5.5.2.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

  introduced in erts-5.5.2.

## Erts 5.5.2.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- The run_erl program now acquires its pseudo-ttys using openpty(3), so that it
  will work on newer Linux distributions that don't have the traditional
  pseudo-tty devices in the file system. On platforms that don't have
  openpty(3), run_erl will still search for pseudo-tty devices in the file
  system.

  The run_erl program will now wait using waitpid(3) to prevent the program it
  spawned to become defunct. run_erl will also terminate after a delay of 5
  seconds (to allow any pending output to be written to the log file) if the
  spawned program terminates even if some child of it still holds stdin and/or
  stdout open.

  generated.

  Own Id: OTP-6235 Aux Id: seq10444

- The registered name of a process is now the last observable resource removed
  before links and monitors are triggered when a process terminates.

  Previously ets tables were removed after the registered name. This could cause
  problems on the runtime system with SMP support for code that expected that
  ets tables owned by a specific process had been removed if the name of the
  process had been removed.

  Own Id: OTP-6268

### Improvements and New Features

- Exit signals are now truly asynchronous in the runtime system with SMP
  support. This simplifies locking in bifs a lot, and makes process termination
  cheaper.

  Own Id: OTP-6160

- When tracing on the runtime system with SMP support it can be difficult to
  know when a trace has been delivered to the tracer. A new built in function
  `erlang:trace_delivered/1` has been introduced in order to make it easier to
  know when the trace has been delivered. See the erlang(3) man page for more
  information.

  Own Id: OTP-6205 Aux Id: OTP-6269

- Kernel poll support can now be combined with SMP support. Currently the
  following kernel poll versions exist: `/dev/poll`, `epoll`, and `kqueue`.
  Linux `kpoll` has been replaced with `epoll`. Some time in the future there
  will also be a kernel poll version using Solaris event ports.

  The "check io" implementation for unix has been completely rewritten. The
  current kernel poll implementation reduce the amount of system calls needed
  compared to the old kernel poll implementation.

  When `epoll` or `kqueue` is used either `poll` or `select` is used as
  fallback. Previously only `poll` could be used as fallback. Since `select` now
  can be used as fallback, kernel poll support is now also available on newer
  MacOSX. Note however, when `select` is used as fallback, the maximum number of
  file descriptors is limited to `FD_SETSIZE`.

  Kernel poll support is now enabled by default if `/dev/poll`, `epoll`, or
  `kqueue` is found when building OTP, i.e. you do not have to pass the
  `--enable-kernel-poll` argument to `configure`. As before, kernel poll is
  disabled by default in the runtime system. In order to enable it, pass the
  `+Ktrue` command line argument to `erl`.

  Note: `configure` will refuse to enable kernel poll support on FreeBSD since
  `kqueue` have problems with (at least) pipes on all version of FreeBSD that we
  have tested.

- Complex pattern matching of strings would fail in the 64 bits emulator because
  of a bug in the loader. (Thanks to Igor Goryachev.)

  Own Id: OTP-6142

- `-134217728 div 134217728` and `-134217728 rem 134217728` would be calculated
  incorrectly. [`abs(-2147483648)`](`abs/1`) could in unlucky circumstances
  cause a heap overflow, as could size(Binary) when size of the binary was
  larger than 128Mb.

  Own Id: OTP-6154

- erlang:display/1 displayed erroneous values for negative integers.

  Big integers (both positive and negative) were previously displayed in
  hexadecimal form while small integers were displayed in decimal form. All
  integers are now displayed in decimal form.

  NOTE: erlang:display/1 should only be used for debugging.

  Own Id: OTP-6156

- A call to erlang:trace/3 with erroneous flags caused the SMP emulator to
  deadlock instead of exiting the calling process with badarg.

  Own Id: OTP-6175

- A bug causing the emulator to hang when exiting a process that is exception
  traced has been fixed.

  Own Id: OTP-6180

- ets:rename/1 could deadlock, or crash the SMP emulator when the table wasn't a
  named table.

  ets:next/2, and ets:prev/2 could return erroneous results on the SMP emulator.

  Own Id: OTP-6198 Aux Id: seq10392, seq10415

- A memory allocation bug could cause the SMP emulator to crash when a process
  had executed a `receive after` with a larger timeout than 10 minutes.

  Own Id: OTP-6199

- The runtime system with SMP support did not slowly adjust its view of time
  when the system time suddenly changed.

  Timeouts could sometimes timeout too early on the runtime system with SMP
  support.

  Own Id: OTP-6202

### Improvements and New Features

- The smp runtime system now automatically detects the number of logical
  processors on MacOSX (darwin) and OpenBSD.

  The smp runtime system is now built by default on MacOSX (darwin) on x86.

  Own Id: OTP-6119

- The `-smp` command line argument now take the following options: `enable`,
  `auto`, or `disable`.

  Especially the `-smpauto` argument is useful since it starts the Erlang
  runtime system with SMP support if it is available and more than one logical
  processor are detected; otherwise, it starts the Erlang runtime system without
  SMP support. For more information see the [erl](erl_cmd.md) man page.

  Own Id: OTP-6126

- Increased the reduction cost for sending messages in the SMP emulator so it
  behaves more like the non-SMP emulator.

  Own Id: OTP-6196

- A port running a dynamically linked-in driver that exits due to the driver
  being unloaded now exits with exit reason `driver_unloaded`. Previously the
  port exited with exit reason `-1`.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-6204

- Changed name of the `erlang:system_info/1` argument `scheduler` to
  `scheduler_id`. This since the `scheduler` argument so easily could be mixed
  up with the `schedulers` argument (both returning integers).

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-6208

- The changes below were made by Mikael Pettersson, HiPE.

  HiPE runtime system:

  Reduce overheads in the HiPE runtime system's BIF glue code.

  Fix bug when exceptions are thrown from BEAM to HiPE.

  Support SPARC on Linux.

  Support x86 on FreeBSD.

  Floating-point exceptions:

  Reduce overheads in checking results of floating-point operations.

  Minor bug fix in SSE2 floating-point exception handling.

  Support SSE2 floating-point exceptions on 32-bit x86 machines.

  Make FP exceptions work in the SMP runtime system on FreeBSD/x86.

  Support floating-point exceptions on SPARCs running Linux.

  Runtime system:

  Minor scheduler optimisation in the non-SMP runtime system.

  Substantial reduction of I/O thread overheads in the SMP runtime system if the
  separate timer thread is used. (In R11B-1, the separate timer thread is not
  used.)

## ERTS 5.5

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Previously [`unlink/1`](`unlink/1`) and `erlang:demonitor/2` behaved
  completely asynchronous. This had one undesirable effect, though. You could
  never know when you were guaranteed _not_ to be affected by a link that you
  had unlinked or a monitor that you had demonitored.

  The new behavior of [`unlink/1`](`unlink/1`) and `erlang:demonitor/2` can be
  viewed as two operations performed atomically. Asynchronously send an unlink
  signal or a demonitor signal, and ignore any future results of the link or
  monitor.

  _NOTE_: This change can cause some obscure code to fail which previously did
  not. For example, the following code might hang:

  ```erlang
              Mon = erlang:monitor(process, Pid),
              %% ...
              exit(Pid, bang),
              erlang:demonitor(Mon),
              receive
                  {'DOWN', Mon , process, Pid, _} -> ok
              %% We were previously guaranteed to get a down message
              %% (since we exited the process ourself), so we could
              %% in this case leave out:
              %% after 0 -> ok
              end,
  ```

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-5772

- Two bugs fixed: If the environment variable `ERL_FLAGS` was set, its contents
  would be appended to the end of the command line even if the command line had
  an `-extra` options. Changed to place the options from `ERL_FLAGS` just before
  `-extra`. Also, the `-smp` and `-hybrid` flags no longer have any effect if
  placed after `-extra`.

  Own Id: OTP-6054

### Improvements and New Features

- The documentation for writing drivers in the ERTS User's Guide has been
  expanded and updated.

  Own Id: OTP-5192

- The `andalso` and `orelse` operators are now allowed to be used in guards.
  That also applies to match specifications.

  Own Id: OTP-5894 Aux Id: OTP-5149

- There is a new trace match spec function `{exception_trace}` and a
  corresponding trace message `exception_from` that can be used to trace on any
  exit from a function, both normal function return and exception return. See
  the documentation for details.

  The `return_to` trace message is now also generated when the execution returns
  to a function due to catching an exception.

  Own Id: OTP-5956

- Erlang runtime system with SMP (symmetric multi processing) support.

  The runtime system with SMP support is in this release focused on stability
  and there are a number of steps with optimizations to follow before it will
  take full advantage of multi processor systems. The released system is however
  truly multi threaded and you will notice increased performance for many
  applications already. We recommend that you evaluate your application on the
  SMP version of the runtime system and wait for some more optimizations before
  you use it in a real product. You will then discover if there are any problems
  in your application that needs to be fixed in order for it to work properly in
  a multi threaded environment. More optimized versions of the runtime system
  with SMP support will be included in the R11B maintenance releases.

  The SMP enabled runtime system will be started if the `-smp` command line
  argument is passed to the `erl` command. In order to make use of more than one
  processor core, multiple scheduler threads are used. By default, the number of
  scheduler threads will equal the number of processor cores. The number of
  scheduler threads can be set with the `+S` command line argument. For more
  information see the [erl](erl_cmd.md) man page.

  A runtime system with SMP support is by default built on the following
  platforms if posix threads, and a gcc compiler of at least version 2.95 is
  found:

  - Linux with at least kernel version 2.6 and the Native POSIX Thread Library
    on x86, x86_64, and 32-bits PowerPC.
  - Solaris of at least version 8 on 32-bits SPARC-V9.
  - MacOSX of at least version 10.4 (Darwin 8.0) on 32-bits PowerPC.

  The runtime system with SMP support is known _not_ to build on:

  - Windows.
  - Linux with kernel versions less than 2.4, or without the Native POSIX Thread
    Library.
  - Other hardware platforms than x86, x86_64, 32-bits SPARC-V9 and 32-bits
    PowerPC.

  Windows will be supported in a future release.

  The runtime system with SMP support might build on other operating systems in
  combination with supported hardware. In order to force a build of a runtime
  system with SMP support, pass the `--enable-smp-support` command line argument
  to configure. Note, however, that it is not enough that it builds. The
  underlying thread library and operating system has to provide SMP support as
  well. If the thread library does not distribute scheduler threads over
  multiple processor cores then the runtime system will only seemingly provide
  SMP support. If the runtime system is not built by default on a specific
  platform, we have _not_ tested it on that platform.

  _NOTE_: The design of SMP support for drivers is ongoing. There will probably
  be incompatible driver changes (only affecting drivers run on the runtime
  system with SMP support) released as patches for R11B.

  _Potential incompatibility_: Previously, specific driver call-backs were
  always called from the same thread. This is _not_ true in the runtime system
  with SMP support. Calls to call-backs will be made from different threads,
  e.g., two consecutive calls to exactly the same call-back can be made from two
  different threads. This will in _most_ cases not be a problem. All calls to
  call-backs are synchronized, i.e., only one call-back will be called at a
  time.

  In the future the default behavior will _probably_ be the following: Calls to
  call-backs will, as now, be made from different threads. Calls to call-backs
  in the same driver _instance_ will be synchronized. It will probably be
  possible to configure so that all calls to call-backs in all driver instances
  of a specific driver type will be synchronized. It may be possible to
  configure so that all calls to call-backs of a driver instance or a of a
  specific driver type will be made from the same thread.

  Parallelism in the Erlang code executed is a necessity for the Erlang runtime
  system to be able to take advantage of multi-core or multi-processor hardware.
  There need to be at least as many Erlang processes runnable as processor cores
  for the Erlang runtime system to be able to take advantage of all processor
  cores.

  An Erlang runtime system with SMP support with only one Erlang process
  runnable all the time will almost always be slower than the same Erlang
  runtime system without SMP support. This is due to thread synchronization
  overhead.

  Known major bottleneck in the Erlang runtime system:

  - Currently the I/O system uses one "big lock", i.e. only one thread can do
    I/O at a time (with the exception of async threads and threads created by
    users own linked-in drivers). This is high on the list of things to
    optimize. Note, code that does not do I/O can be executed at the same time
    as one thread does I/O.

  Some pitfalls which might cause Erlang programs that work on the non-SMP
  runtime system to fail on the SMP runtime system:

  - A newly spawned process will often begin executing immediately. Code that
    expects that the parent process will be able to execute for a while before
    the child process begins executing is likely to fail.
  - High priority processes could previously provide mutual exclusion (bad
    programming style) by preventing normal and low priority processes from
    being run. High priority processes cannot be used this way to provide mutual
    exclusion.
  - `erlang:yield()` could be used to provide some kind of temporary mutual
    exclusion (also bad programming style). `erlang:yield()` cannot be used to
    provide any kind of mutual exclusion.
  - Obscure pitfall, only if a process being traced also sends normal messages
    to the tracer:  
      The order between trace messages and normal messages is undefined. I.e.
    the order between normal messages sent from a tracee to a tracer and the
    trace messages generated from the same tracee to the same tracer is
    undefined. The internal order of normal messages and the internal order of
    trace messages will, of course, be preserved as before.

  The kernel poll feature is currently not supported by the runtime system with
  SMP support. It will probably be supported in a future release.

  Own Id: OTP-6006 Aux Id: OTP-6095

- Linked-in driver modifications.

  - Linked-in drivers must be recompiled.
  - The `refc` field in the `ErlDrvBinary` type has been removed. The reference
    count can be accessed via API functions. For more information see the
    `erl_driver(3)` man page.

## ERTS 5.4.13

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Large files (more than 2 GBytes) are now handled on Solaris 8.

  Own Id: OTP-5849 Aux Id: seq10157

- A failing bit syntax construction could fail with the PREVIOUS exception
  reason that had occurred in the process (instead of with `badarg`).

  Own Id: OTP-5911

- When building OTP, the Kernel application was built in both the primary and
  secondary bootstrap steps, which would cause problems if OTP including its
  bootstrap is checked into a version control system (such as CVS). (Thanks to
  Sebastian Strollo.)

  Own Id: OTP-5921

- `binary_to_term(<<131,109,255,255,255,255)` and similar expressions used to
  crash the emulator instead of causing a `badarg` exception. (Thanks to
  Matthias Lang.)

  Own Id: OTP-5933

- `erlang:hibernate/3` could sometimes crash the emulator when no heap was
  needed.

  Own Id: OTP-5940

- Execution of match specs could under rare circumstances cause the emulator to
  dump core.

  Execution of match specs could cause memory leaks in the hybrid emulator.

  Own Id: OTP-5955

- A bug in `erlang:trace_info/2` when getting info for a function in a deleted
  module resulting in an emulator crash, has been corrected.

  Own Id: OTP-5957

- Different (and old) `config.guess` files in the ERTS and Erl_Interface
  applications would cause build problems on the new Intel-based iMacs. (Thanks
  to Sebastion Strollo.)

  Own Id: OTP-5967

- pthread header and library mismatch on Linux systems (at least some SuSE and
  Debian) with both NPTL and Linuxthreads libraries installed.

  Own Id: OTP-5981

### Improvements and New Features

- The driver_set_timer did not change the previous timeout if called a second
  time. Now it works as specified, changing the timeout.

  Own Id: OTP-5942

- The undocumented `{packet,http}` option (for the `gen_tcp` module) did not
  work correctly when there were multiple continuation lines. (Thanks to Per
  Hedeland.)

  Own Id: OTP-5945

- The setuid_socket_wrap program was corrected to work for C compilers that
  treat the `char` type as unsigned. (Thanks to Magnus Henoch.)

  Own Id: OTP-5946

## ERTS 5.4.12

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixed a minor build problem on Windows.

  Own Id: OTP-5819 Aux Id: OTP-5382 OTP-5540 OTP-5577

- The `delay_send` option for `gen_tcp` was broken on Windows.

  Own Id: OTP-5822

- If there were user-defined variables in the boot script, and their values were
  not provided using the `-boot_var` option, the emulator would refuse to start
  with a confusing error message. Corrected to show a clear, understandable
  message.

  The `prim_file` module was modified to not depend on the `lists` module, to
  make it possible to start the emulator using a user-defined loader. (Thanks to
  Martin Bjorklund.)

  Own Id: OTP-5828 Aux Id: seq10151

### Improvements and New Features

- The HiPE compiler identifies more leaf functions, giving slightly faster code.

  Corrected problems in HiPE's coalescing register allocating that would cause
  it to fail when compiling very large functions (e.g. some of parse modules in
  the Megaco application).

  Own Id: OTP-5853

## ERTS 5.4.11

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Timers could sometimes timeout too early. This bug has now been fixed.

  Automatic cancellation of timers created by
  `erlang:send_after(Time,pid(),Msg)` and `erlang:start_timer(Time,pid(),Msg)`
  has been introduced. Timers created with the receiver specified by a pid, will
  automatically be cancelled when the receiver exits. For more information see
  the `m:erlang` man page.

  In order to be able to maintain a larger amount of timers without increasing
  the maintenance cost, the internal timer wheel and bif timer table have been
  enlarged.

  Also a number of minor bif timer optimizations have been implemented.

  Own Id: OTP-5795 Aux Id: OTP-5090, seq8913, seq10139, OTP-5782

- `erlang:monitor(process,Pid)` hanged if `Pid` referred to a process on a
  non-existing node with the same nodename as the nodename of node on which the
  call was made. This bug has now been fixed.

  Own Id: OTP-5827

### Improvements and New Features

- By setting Unix environment variables, the priority for the emulator can be
  lowered when it is writing crash dumps and the time allowed for finishing
  writing a crash dump can be set to a certain number of seconds. See the
  documentation for `erl` in the ERTS application. (Also, a few other previously
  undocumented environment variables are now documented.)

  Own Id: OTP-5818

- Documentation improvements:

  \- documentation for `erlang:link/1` corrected

  \- command line flag `-code_path_cache` added

  \- `erl` command line flags clarifications

  \- `m:net_kernel` clarifications

  Own Id: OTP-5847

## ERTS 5.4.10

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- \-D_GNU_SOURCE is now always passed on the compile command line on linux. This
  in order to ensure that all included system headers see \_GNU_SOURCE defined.

  \_GNU_SOURCE is now also defined on linux in configure when looking for
  features.

  Some minor (harmless) configure bugs were also fixed.

  Own Id: OTP-5749

- Some compiler warnings and Dialyzer warnings were eliminated in the Tools
  application.

  When tracing to a port (which `fprof` does), there could be fake schedule
  out/schedule in messages sent for a process that had exited.

  Own Id: OTP-5757

### Improvements and New Features

- The BIFs [`iolist_size/1`](`iolist_size/1`) and
  [`iolist_to_binary/1`](`iolist_to_binary/1`) has been added.

  The BIF [`list_to_existing_atom/1`](`list_to_existing_atom/1`) has been added.

  Minor bug fix: The exception reason could be changed to `error` inside nested
  try/catch constructs if the `erlang:raise/3` BIF was called with an empty
  stacktrace. (Calling `erlang:raise/3` with an empty stacktrace is NOT
  recommended.)

  Minor bugfix: On Windows, `file:open/2` will now return the documented error
  reason `{error,eisdir}` if the filename refers to a directory (it used to
  return `{error,eacces}`).

  The message in the documentation for `erlang:system_monitor/2`, description of
  `busy_dist_port`, was corrected.

  Own Id: OTP-5709 Aux Id: seq10100

- The previously undocumented and UNSUPPORTED `zlib` module has been updated in
  an incompatible way and many bugs have been corrected. It is now also
  documented.

  \*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY \***

  Own Id: OTP-5715

- New socket options `priority` and `tos` for platforms that support them
  (currently only Linux).

  Own Id: OTP-5756

- Only the emulator is now linked with termcap library in order to decrease
  library dependencies for other otp programs.

  Own Id: OTP-5758

## ERTS 5.4.9.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- The native resolver has gotten an control API for extended debugging and soft
  restart. It is: `inet_gethost_native:control(Control)`  
  `Control = {debug_level,Level} | soft_restart`  
  `Level = integer() in the range 0-4`.

  Own Id: OTP-5751 Aux Id: EABln25013

## ERTS 5.4.9.1

### Improvements and New Features

- On VxWorks, epmd did not handle file descriptors with higher numbers than 63.
  Also, if epmd should get a file descriptor with a number >= FD_SETSIZE, it
  will close a the file descriptor and write a message to the log (instead of
  mysteriously fail); the Erlang node that tried to register will fail with a
  duplicate_name error (unfortunately, epmd has no way to indicate to the Erlang
  node why the register attempt failed).

  Own Id: OTP-5716 Aux Id: seq10070

## ERTS 5.4.9

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Timezone data is now initialized better. (was a problem at least on NetBSD
  2.0.2) Thanks to Rich Neswold.

  Own Id: OTP-5621

- The hybrid-heap emulator ('erl -hybrid') is much more stable. We have
  corrected all known bugs that caused it to dump core while running our test
  suites.

  Own Id: OTP-5634

- Fixed rare memory leaks in `erlang:demonitor/1` when distributed monitors were
  removed.

  Own Id: OTP-5692

- Processes were sometimes unnecessarily garbage collected when terminating.
  These unnecessary garbage collections have now been eliminated.

  Own Id: OTP-5693

### Improvements and New Features

- The `c:i/0` function will now run in a paged mode if there are more than 100
  processes in the system. (Thanks to Ulf Wiger.)

  `erlang:system_info(process_count)` has been optimized and does now return
  exactly the same value as [`length(processes())`](`length/1`). Previously
  `erlang:system_info(process_count)` did not include exiting processes which
  are included in [`length(processes())`](`length/1`).

  The `+P` flag for `erl`, which sets the maximum number of processes allowed to
  exist at the same, no longer accepts values higher than 134217727. (You will
  still probably run out of memory before you'll be able to reach that limit.)

  Own Id: OTP-5645 Aux Id: seq9984

- The term-building driver functions `driver_output_term()` and
  `driver_send_term()` have been updated:

  The ERL_DRV_FLOAT type has been added.

  For the ERL_DRV_BINARY type, the length and offset are now validated against
  the length of the driver binary.

  The ERL_DRV_PID type is now implemented (it was documented, but not
  implemented).

  Own Id: OTP-5674

## ERTS 5.4.8

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- `ets:delete/1` now allows other Erlang process to run when a large table is
  being deleted.

  Own Id: OTP-5572

- A bug regarding tcp sockets which results in hanging `gen_tcp:send/2` has been
  corrected. To encounter this bug you needed one process that read from a
  socket, one that wrote more date than the reader read out so the sender got
  suspended, and then the reader closed the socket. (Reported and diagnosed by
  Alexey Shchepin.)

  Corrected a bug in the (undocumented and unsupported) option `{packet,http}`
  for `gen_tcp.` (Thanks to Claes Wikstrom and Luke Gorrie.)

  Updated the documentation regarding the second argument to `gen_tcp:recv/2`,
  the `Length` to receive.

  Own Id: OTP-5582 Aux Id: seq9839

- Erlang/OTP will now build on Mac OS X 10.4 "Tiger" (the problem was that 10.4
  has a partially implemented poll() function that can't handle devices). Also,
  on Mac OS X 10.3 "Panther", Erlang/OTP will now use select() instead of poll()
  (because poll() on Mac OS X 10.3 is implemented using select()).

  Own Id: OTP-5595

- A bug in the file driver when opening a file in compressed mode, and the
  returned allocated pointer from the compressing library was in very high
  memory (>= 2GB), causing e.g. `file:read/2` to return `{error,ebadf}`, has
  been corrected.

  Own Id: OTP-5618

### Improvements and New Features

- The new fun `M:F/A` construct creates a fun that refers to the latest version
  of `M:F/A.` This syntax is meant to replace tuple funs `{M,F}` which have many
  problems.

  The new type test [`is_function(Fun,A)`](`is_function/2`) (which may be used
  in guards) test whether `Fun` is a fun that can be applied with `A` arguments.
  (Currently, `Fun` can also be a tuple fun.)

  Own Id: OTP-5584

- In the HiPE application, there's a new experimental register allocator
  (optimistic coalescing), and the linear scan register allocator is now also
  available on ppc. Plus lots of cleanups.

  Minor hybrid heap corrections.

  The maximum size of a heap used to be artificially limited so that the size of
  a heap would fit in 28 bits; that limitation could cause the emulator to
  terminate in a garbage collection even if there still was available memory.
  Now the largest heap size for a 32 bit CPU is 1,699,221,830 bytes. (Thanks to
  Jesper Wilhelmsson.)

  Also removed the undocumented `+H` emulator option.

  Own Id: OTP-5596

## ERTS 5.4.7

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- `to_erl` could close unexpectedly on Linux systems. Also, output from the
  emulator could be lost. Corrected.

  Own Id: OTP-5561

### Improvements and New Features

- The `cpu_timestamp` option for `erlang:trace/3` is now also supported on
  Linux.

  Own Id: OTP-5532 Aux Id: seq9813

- The last known `werl` window size/position is now saved correctly when `werl`
  is stopped with the window minimized. A problem with the placement not being
  saved if the emulator is halted or stopped from the JCL menu has also been
  fixed.

  Own Id: OTP-5544 Aux Id: OTP-5522

## ERTS 5.4.6

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Some math libraries do not always throw floating-point exceptions on errors.
  In order to be able to use these libraries, floating-point errors are now more
  thoroughly checked.

  Misc floating-point fixes for Linux and MacOSX.

  Own Id: OTP-5467

- An internal buffer was sometimes not cleared which caused garbage to appear in
  error messages sent to the error logger.

  `errno` was sometimes clobbered which caused erroneous error reports about
  `poll()` errors.

  Only emulators on unix platforms were affected by these bugs.

  Own Id: OTP-5492

- The ethread library now works on OpenBSD.

  Own Id: OTP-5515

- Corrected a bug in the (undocumented and unsupported) option `{packet,http}`
  for `gen_tcp`. (Thanks to Claes Wikstrom and Luke Gorrie.)

  Own Id: OTP-5519

### Improvements and New Features

- [`binary_to_term/1`](`binary_to_term/1`) could cause the emulator to crash
  when given invalid pids or funs.

  Own Id: OTP-5484 Aux Id: seq9801

- Some more stability problems were fixed in the hybrid-heap emulator.

  Own Id: OTP-5489

- After `werl` was closed with the window minimized, it was not possible to
  restart `werl` with an open window. A temporary solution has so far been
  implemented that restores the initial window settings every time `werl` is
  started.

  Own Id: OTP-5522

## ERTS 5.4.5

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- If a process had node links (created by [`monitor_node/2`](`monitor_node/2`)),
  executing [`process_info(Pid,memory)`](`process_info/2`) for that process
  would crash the emulator.

  Own Id: OTP-5420

- Minor corrections to the help text printed by `erlc -help`. The documentation
  for `erlc` was also slightly updated.

  Own Id: OTP-5428

- 32-bit words were used for offsets in the garbage collector. This caused the
  emulator to crash on 64-bit machines when heaps were moved more than 4 GB
  during garbage collection.

  Own Id: OTP-5430

- [`is_boolean(42.5)`](`is_boolean/1`) failed to load if optimization was

- If there was a call to `Module:foo/X` from any loaded module, the returned by
  `M:module_info(exports)` would always include `{foo,X}` (even though
  `Module:foo/X` if was not defined).

### Improvements and New Features

- The `c` option for the `+B` flag has been introduced which makes it possible
  to use Ctrl-C (Ctrl-Break on Windows) to interrupt the shell process rather
  than to invoke the emulator break handler. All new `+B` options are also
  supported on Windows (`werl`) as of now. Furthermore, Ctrl-C on Windows has
  now been reserved for copying text (what Ctrl-Ins was used for previously).
  Ctrl-Break should be used for break handling. Lastly, the documentation of the
  system flags has been updated.

## ERTS 5.4.4

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- The function `erlang:float/1` can now be used in match specifications and is
  recognized by `dbg:fun2ms/1` and `ets:fun2ms/1`. This addition is part of the
  work to "harmonize" match specification guards with Erlang guards.

- The [`register/2`](`register/2`) BIF would return `true` even if the second
  argument was not a pid for living process. Corrected to cause an exception.

- In the 'bag' type of ets tables, elements having the same key were supposed to
  be order in insertion order. The would be wrong if a rehash occurred.

  Own Id: OTP-5340 Aux Id: seq9704

- Linked in drivers in the Crypto and Asn1 applications are now compiled with
  the `-D_THREAD_SAFE` and `-D_REENTRANT` switches on unix when the emulator has
  thread support enabled.

  Linked in drivers on MacOSX are not compiled with the undocumented
  `-lbundle1.o` switch anymore. Thanks to Sean Hinde who sent us a patch.

  Linked in driver in Crypto, and port programs in SSL, now compiles on OSF1.

  Minor makefile improvements in Runtime_Tools.

- Fixed a bug in the hybrid heap in distributed send operations.

  Own Id: OTP-5361

- A BIF `erlang:raise/3` has been added. See the manual for details. It is
  intended for internal system programming only, advanced error handling.

- Mikael Pettersson (HiPE) corrected a few bugs in the emulator that caused
  problems when compiled with the experimental gcc-4.0.0.

  Own Id: OTP-5386

### Improvements and New Features

- Minor update of the internal documentation of the `epmd` protocol.

  The listen port of `epmd` has now been registered at IANA:
  [http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers](http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers).

- `run_erl.c` now works on Mac OS X and FreeBSD.

  Own Id: OTP-5384

- A few bugs were corrected in the HiPE application.

## ERTS 5.4.3

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Font and color preferences for `werl.exe` now can be saved even after the
  first time you run `werl.exe`. The window position and size is also saved.
  Patch from James Hague who did all the hard work.

- OTP archive libraries, e.g. the `erl_interface` library, on MacOSX could not
  be used without first rerunning `ranlib` on them. This bug has now been fixed.

  Own Id: OTP-5274

- Bugs in `erlang:hash/2` and `erlang:phash/2` on 64-bit platforms have been
  fixed.

  Own Id: OTP-5292

### Improvements and New Features

- Corrected a crash in the 64-bits emulator.

  Corrected a problem in the hybrid heap emulator.

  In the chapter about the abstract format in the ERTS User's Guide, updated the
  last section about how the abstract format is stored in BEAM files.

- The maximum number of concurrent threads in the internal ethread thread
  package has been limited to 2048.

## ERTS 5.4.2.1

### Improvements and New Features

- If Erlang/OTP was installed in a short directory name, such as
  `C:\Program\erl5.4.2`, the emulator would not start.

  Own Id: OTP-5254

## ERTS 5.4.2

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- If one used `select/3` and `select/1` on a non-fixed ETS table and deleted
  objects simultaneously, the emulator could crash. Note that the result of such
  simultaneous operations on tables that are not in a fixed state is still
  undefined, but the emulator crash is, needless to say, fixed.

  Own Id: OTP-5209 Aux Id: seq9198

- Arithmetic with big numbers could crash the emulator.

  The HiPE native code compiler and run-time code in the emulator has been
  updated. (Note: Native code is still not supported.)

  Eliminated a few bugs that could crash the hybrid emulator (which is not
  supported).

## ERTS 5.4.1

### Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- The ethread library was unnecessarily rebuilt multiple times during the build
  process, also a debug version of the library was build during the install
  phase. These unnecessary builds have now been removed. Note, the content of
  the installed Erlang/OTP system is not effected at all by this change.

  Own Id: OTP-5203

- The emulator could fail to clear the memory segment cache. This could
  potentially cause memory allocation to unnecessarily fail when memory usage
  was close to its maximum. This bug has now been fixed.

  Own Id: OTP-5211

- std_alloc (std short for standard) was sometimes called def_alloc (def short
  for default). std_alloc is now everywhere referred to as std_alloc.

  Own Id: OTP-5216

- A documentation bug has been corrected in the `erts_alloc(3)` documentation.
  It was stated that some of the memory allocators present were by default
  disabled. This is true for Erlang/OTP R9C, but is not true for Erlang/OTP
  R10B. In R10B all memory allocators present are enabled by default.

  Own Id: OTP-5217

### Improvements and New Features

- The emulator now close all open files and sockets immediately after receiving
  an USR1 signal. This causes the emulator to unregister at `epmd` as early as
  possible.

  Own Id: OTP-5221 Aux Id: OTP-4985, seq9514

- Try/catch support in the emulator slightly updated.
