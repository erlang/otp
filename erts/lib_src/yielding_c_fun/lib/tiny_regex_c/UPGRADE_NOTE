The scripts folder (contained test python scripts) that existed in the
original repository has been removed as it was not used and contained a
license text that was incompatible with Erlang/OTP's license.

The tests folder that exited in the original repository has also been
removed because it was not used.

The file GIT_VERSION contains information of which repository URL and
GIT version the code in this folder was fetched from. The GIT_VERSION
file should be updated if the code in this folder is upgraded.
