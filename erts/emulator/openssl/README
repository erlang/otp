This directory contains a *very* small part of OpenSSL. Currently only
parts of the OpenSSL MD5 implementation.

The files that has been taken from OpenSSL:

./LICENSE.txt
./crypto/md5/md5_local.h
./crypto/md5/md5_dgst.c
./include/crypto/md32_common.h
./include/openssl_local/md5.h (renamed from include/openssl/md5.h)

The OpenSSL version that these files currently has been taken from can
be found in the ./vendor.info file.

Update these files from the upstream OpenSSL repository by running the
'./update' script. The script will update the files taken from OpenSSL
and then mirror those to 'lib/erl_interface/src/openssl'. These two
MD5 implementations should be kept in sync. Run "./update help" for
more information about the script.
