Breaking Changes
----------------

Breaking the API is sometimes inevitable, what to do?

  * See [Breaking Changes Guide](https://asmjit.com/doc/group__asmjit__breaking__changes.html), which is now part of AsmJit documentation.
  * See asmjit tests, they always compile and provide implementation of many use-cases:
    * [asmjit_test_emitters.cpp](./test/asmjit_test_emitters.cpp) - Tests that demonstrate the purpose of emitters.
    * [asmjit_test_assembler_x86.cpp](./test/asmjit_test_assembler_x86.cpp) - Tests targeting AsmJit's Assembler (x86/x64).
    * [asmjit_test_compiler_x86.cpp](./test/asmjit_test_compiler_x86.cpp) - Tests targeting AsmJit's Compiler (x86/x64).
    * [asmjit_test_instinfo.cpp](./test/asmjit_test_instinfo.cpp) - Tests that query instruction information.
    * [asmjit_test_x86_sections.cpp](./test/asmjit_test_x86_sections.cpp) - Multiple sections test.

Project Organization
--------------------

  * **`/`**        - Project root.
    * **src**      - Source code.
      * **asmjit** - Source code and headers (always point include path in here).
        * **core** - Core API, backend independent except relocations.
        * **arm**  - ARM specific API, used only by ARM and AArch64 backends.
        * **x86**  - X86 specific API, used only by X86 and X64 backends.
    * **test**     - Unit and integration tests (don't embed in your project).
    * **tools**    - Tools used for configuring, documenting, and generating files.

TODO

  * [ ] Core:
    * [ ] Add support for user external buffers in CodeBuffer / CodeHolder.
  * [ ] Ports:
    * [ ] 32-bit ARM/Thumb port.
    * [ ] 64-bit ARM (AArch64) port.
    * [ ] RISC-V port.
