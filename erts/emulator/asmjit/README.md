Project Organization
--------------------

  * **`/`**              - Project root - project files and scripts, `include` path points here
    * **asmjit**         - AsmJit source code and headers
      * **core**         - Core API, backend independent except relocations
      * **support**      - Support classes and functions
      * **arm**          - ARM specific API, designed to be common for both AArch32 and AArch64
      * **a64**          - AArch64 specific API, used only by AArch64 backends
      * **x86**          - X86 specific API, used only by X86 and X64 backends
      * **ujit**         - Universal JIT API
    * **asmjit-testing** - Unit tests, integration tests, and benchmarks (don't embed in your project)
      * **commons**      - Common utilities shared between tests and benchmarks
      * **bench**        - Benchmarks
      * **tests**        - Unit tests and integration tests
    * **db**             - Instruction database
    * **tools**          - Tools used to re-regenerate generated files (instruction DB, enum strings)

Breaking Changes
----------------

Breaking the API is sometimes inevitable, what to do?

  * See [Breaking Changes Guide](https://asmjit.com/doc/group__asmjit__breaking__changes.html), which is now part of AsmJit documentation
  * See asmjit tests, they always compile and provide implementation of many use-cases:
    * [asmjit_test_emitters.cpp](./asmjit-testing/tests/asmjit_test_emitters.cpp) - Tests that demonstrate the purpose of emitters
    * [asmjit_test_assembler_x86.cpp](./asmjit-testing/tests/asmjit_test_assembler_x86.cpp) - Tests targeting AsmJit's Assembler (x86/x64)
    * [asmjit_test_compiler_x86.cpp](./asmjit-testing/tests/asmjit_test_compiler_x86.cpp) - Tests targeting AsmJit's Compiler (x86/x64)
    * [asmjit_test_instinfo.cpp](./asmjit-testing/tests/asmjit_test_instinfo.cpp) - Tests that query instruction information
    * [asmjit_test_x86_sections.cpp](./asmjit-testing/tests/asmjit_test_x86_sections.cpp) - Multiple sections test
