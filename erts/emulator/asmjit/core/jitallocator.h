  //! Enables the use of an anonymous memory-mapped memory that is mapped into two buffers having a different pointer.
  //! The first buffer has read and execute permissions and the second buffer has read+write permissions.
  //!
  //! See \ref VirtMem::allocDualMapping() for more details about this feature.
  //!
  //! \remarks Dual mapping would be automatically turned on by \ref JitAllocator in case of hardened runtime that
  //! enforces `W^X` policy, so specifying this flag is essentually forcing to use dual mapped pages even when RWX
  //! pages can be allocated and dual mapping is not necessary.

  //! Enables the use of multiple pools with increasing granularity instead of a single pool. This flag would enable
  //! 3 internal pools in total having 64, 128, and 256 bytes granularity.
  //!
  //! This feature is only recommended for users that generate a lot of code and would like to minimize the overhead
  //! of `JitAllocator` itself by having blocks of different allocation granularities. Using this feature only for
  //! few allocations won't pay off as the allocator may need to create more blocks initially before it can take the
  //! advantage of variable block granularity.
  kUseMultiplePools = 0x00000002u,

  //!
  //! Causes a new block to be cleared by the fill pattern and freshly released memory to be cleared before making
  //! it ready for another use.
  kFillUnusedMemory = 0x00000004u,

  //! When this flag is set the allocator would immediately release unused blocks during `release()` or `reset()`.
  //! When this flag is not set the allocator would keep one empty block in each pool to prevent excessive virtual
  //! memory allocations and deallocations in border cases, which involve constantly allocating and deallocating a
  //! single block caused by repetitive calling `alloc()` and `release()` when the allocator has either no blocks
  //! or have all blocks fully occupied.

ASMJIT_DEFINE_ENUM_FLAGS(JitAllocatorOptions)

//! A simple implementation of memory manager that uses `asmjit::VirtMem`
//! functions to manage virtual memory for JIT compiled code.
//!
//! Implementation notes:
//!
//! - Granularity of allocated blocks is different than granularity for a typical C malloc. In addition, the allocator
//!   can use several memory pools having a different granularity to minimize the maintenance overhead. Multiple pools
//!   feature requires `kFlagUseMultiplePools` flag to be set.
//!
//! - The allocator doesn't store any information in executable memory, instead, the implementation uses two
//!   bit-vectors to manage allocated memory of each allocator-block. The first bit-vector called 'used' is used to
//!   track used memory (where each bit represents memory size defined by granularity) and the second bit vector called
//!   'stop' is used as a sentinel to mark where the allocated area ends.
//!
//! - Internally, the allocator also uses RB tree to keep track of all blocks across all pools. Each inserted block is
//!   added to the tree so it can be matched fast during `release()` and `shrink()`.
