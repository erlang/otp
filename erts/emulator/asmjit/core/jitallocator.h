// ============================================================================
// [asmjit::JitAllocator]
// ============================================================================

//! A simple implementation of memory manager that uses `asmjit::VirtMem`
//! functions to manage virtual memory for JIT compiled code.
//!
//! Implementation notes:
//!
//! - Granularity of allocated blocks is different than granularity for a typical
//!   C malloc. In addition, the allocator can use several memory pools having a
//!   different granularity to minimize the maintenance overhead. Multiple pools
//!   feature requires `kFlagUseMultiplePools` flag to be set.
//!
//! - The allocator doesn't store any information in executable memory, instead,
//!   the implementation uses two bit-vectors to manage allocated memory of each
//!   allocator-block. The first bit-vector called 'used' is used to track used
//!   memory (where each bit represents memory size defined by granularity) and
//!   the second bit vector called 'stop' is used as a sentinel to mark where
//!   the allocated area ends.
//!
//! - Internally, the allocator also uses RB tree to keep track of all blocks
//!   across all pools. Each inserted block is added to the tree so it can be
//!   matched fast during `release()` and `shrink()`.

    //! two buffers having a different pointer. The first buffer has read and

    //! Enables the use of multiple pools with increasing granularity instead of
    //! a single pool. This flag would enable 3 internal pools in total having
    //! 64, 128, and 256 bytes granularity.
    //!
    //! This feature is only recommended for users that generate a lot of code
    //! and would like to minimize the overhead of `JitAllocator` itself by
    //! having blocks of different allocation granularities. Using this feature
    //! only for few allocations won't pay off as the allocator may need to
    //! create more blocks initially before it can take the advantage of
    //! variable block granularity.

    //! When this flag is set the allocator would immediately release unused
    //! blocks during `release()` or `reset()`. When this flag is not set the
    //! allocator would keep one empty block in each pool to prevent excessive
    //! virtual memory allocations and deallocations in border cases, which
    //! involve constantly allocating and deallocating a single block caused
    //! by repetitive calling `alloc()` and `release()` when the allocator has
    //! either no blocks or have all blocks fully occupied.
