# Static declaration of BIFs that should execute on dirty schedulers.
#
# <dirty-bif-decl> ::= <type> <bif>
# <bif> ::= <module> ":" <name> "/" <arity>
# <type> ::= dirty-cpu | dirty-io | dirty-cpu-test | dirty-io-test
#
# When dirty scheduler support is available, a BIF declared with the
# 'dirty-cpu' type will unconditionally execute on a dirty CPU scheduler,
# and a BIF declared with the type 'dirty-io' will unconditionally execute
# on a dirty IO scheduler. When dirty scheduler support is not available
# all BIFs will of course execute on normal schedulers.
#
# When the emulator has been configured with the debug option
# '--enable-dirty-schedulers-test', BIFs with the types 'dirty-cpu-test',
# and 'dirty-io-test' will unconditionally execute on dirty schedulers.
# When this debug option has not been enabled, these BIFs will be executed
# on normal schedulers.
#
# BIFs marked as 'ubif' in ./bif.tab will be ignored, i.e., will always
# execute on normal schedulers.

# --- TEST of Dirty BIF functionality ---
#  Functions below will execute on dirty schedulers when emulator has
#  been configured for testing dirty schedulers. This is used for test
#  and debug purposes only. We really do *not* want to execute these
#  on dirty schedulers on a real system.
