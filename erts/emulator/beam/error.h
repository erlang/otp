/*
 * There are three primary exception classes:
 *
 *	- exit			Process termination - not an error.
 *	- error			Error (adds stacktrace; will be logged).
 *	- thrown		Nonlocal return (turns into a 'nocatch'
 *				error if not caught by the process).
 *
 * In addition, we define a number of exit codes as a convenient
 * short-hand: instead of building the error descriptor term at the time
 * the exception is raised, it is built as necessary when the exception
 * is handled. Examples are EXC_NORMAL, EXC_BADARG, EXC_BADARITH, etc.
 * Some of these have convenient aliases, like BADARG and BADARITH.
