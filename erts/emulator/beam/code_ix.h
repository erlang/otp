/* Description:
 *	This is the interface that facilitates changing the beam code
 *      (load,upgrade,delete) while allowing executing Erlang processes to
 *      access the code without any locks or other expensive memory barriers.
 *
 *      The basic idea is to maintain several "logical copies" of the code. These
 *      copies are identified by a global 'code index', an integer of 0, 1 or 2.
 *      The code index is used as argument to code access structures like
 *      export, module, beam_catches, beam_ranges.
 *
 *      The current 'active' code index is used to access the current running
 *      code. The 'staging' code index is used by the process that performs
 *      a code change operation. When a code change operation completes
 *      succesfully, the staging code index becomes the new active code index.
 *
 *      The third code index is not explicitly used. It can be thought of as
 *      the "previous active" or the "next staging" index. It is needed to make
 *      sure that we do not reuse a code index for staging until we are sure
 *      that no executing BIFs are still referencing it.
 *      We could get by with only two (0 and 1), but that would require that we
 *      must wait for all schedulers to re-schedule before each code change
 *      operation can start staging.
 *
 *      Note that the 'code index' is very loosely coupled to the concept of
 *      'current' and 'old' module versions. You can almost say that they are
 *      orthogonal to each other. Code index is an emulator global concept while
 *      'current' and 'old' is specific for each module.
