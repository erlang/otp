   for ever to determine that they do not match. The default is set very large

   the maximum amount of stack (or heap, if NO_RECURSE is defined) that is
   used. The value of MATCH_LIMIT_RECURSION applies only to recursive calls of
   match(). To have any useful effect, it must be less than the value of

   pcre_recurse_malloc() to obtain memory from the heap. For more detail, see
