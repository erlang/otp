 * hipe_x86_signal.c
 *
 * Erlang code compiled to x86 native code uses the x86 %esp as its
 * stack pointer. This improves performance in several ways:
 * - It permits the use of the x86 call and ret instructions, which
 *   reduces code volume and improves branch prediction.
 * - It avoids stealing a gp register to act as a stack pointer.
 *
 * Unix signal handlers are by default delivered onto the current
 * stack, i.e. %esp. This is a problem since our native-code stacks
 * are small and may not have room for the Unix signal handler.
 *
 * There is a way to redirect signal handlers to an "alternate" signal
 * stack by using the SA_ONSTACK flag with the sigaction() library call.
 * Unfortunately, this has to be specified explicitly for each signal,
 * and it is difficult to enforce given the presence of libraries.
 *
 * Our solution is to override the C library's signal handler setup
 * procedure with our own which enforces the SA_ONSTACK flag.

 * __libc_sigaction() is the core routine.
 * Without libpthread, sigaction() and __sigaction() are both aliases
 * for __libc_sigaction().
 * libpthread redefines __sigaction() as a non-trivial wrapper around
 * __libc_sigaction(), and makes sigaction() an alias for __sigaction().
 * glibc has internal calls to both sigaction() and __sigaction().
 *
 * Overriding __libc_sigaction() would be ideal, but doing so breaks
 * libpthread (threads hang).
 *
 * Overriding __sigaction(), using dlsym RTLD_NEXT to find glibc's
 * version of __sigaction(), works with glibc-2.2.4 and 2.2.5.
 * Unfortunately, this solution doesn't work with earlier versions,
 * including glibc-2.2.2 and glibc-2.1.92 (2.2 despite its name):
 * 2.2.2 SIGSEGVs in dlsym RTLD_NEXT (known glibc bug), and 2.1.92
 * SIGSEGVs inexplicably in two test cases in the HiPE test suite.
 *
 * Instead we only override sigaction() and call __sigaction()
 * directly. This should work for HiPE/x86 as long as only the Posix
 * signal interface is used, i.e. there are no calls to simulated
 * old BSD or SysV interfaces.
 * glibc's internal calls to __sigaction() appear to be mostly safe.
 * hipe_signal_init() fixes some unsafe ones, e.g. the SIGPROF handler.
