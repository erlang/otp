/*
 * Erlang code compiled to x86 native code uses RSP as its stack pointer. This
 * improves performance in several ways:
 *
 * - It permits the use of the x86 call and ret instructions, which
 *   reduces code volume and improves branch prediction.
 * - It avoids stealing a gp register to act as a stack pointer.
 *
 * Unix signal handlers are by default delivered onto the current stack, i.e.
 * RSP. This is a problem since our native-code stacks are small and may not
 * have room for the Unix signal handler.
 *
 * There is a way to redirect signal handlers to an "alternate" signal stack by
 * using the SA_ONSTACK flag with the sigaction(2) system call. Unfortunately,
 * this has to be specified explicitly for each signal, and it is impossible to
 * enforce given the presence of libraries.
 *
 * We used to attempt to override the C library's signal handler setup
 * procedure with our own that added the SA_ONSTACK flag, but it only worked
 * with `GNU libc` which is not always the current libc. As many of our users
 * liked to run docker images with `Alpine` which uses `musl` instead, they got
 * needlessly bad performance without knowing it.
 *
 * Instead, we now explicitly add SA_ONSTACK to our own uses of sigaction(2)
 * and ignore the library problem altogether because:
 * 
 *   1. We don't care about this problem on non-scheduler threads: if a library
 *      wants to fiddle around with signals on its own threads then it doesn't
 *      affect us.
 *   2. We don't care about this problem when executing on the runtime stack:
 *      if a NIF or driver uses signals in a creative manner locally during a
 *      call, then that's fine as long as they restore them before returning to
 *      Erlang code.
 *
 *      A NIF or driver that doesn't do this is misbehaving to begin with and
 *      we can't shield ourselves against that.
 *   3. If a library that we're statically linked to messes around with signals
 *      in the initialization phase (think C++ constructors of static objects),
 *      all of it will happen before `main` runs and we'll set things straight
 *      in `sys_init_signal_stack`.
 *
 *      If a dynamically linked library does the same, the same restrictions as
 *      ordinary NIF/driver calls apply to the initialization phase and the
 *      library must restore the signals before returning.
 *
 *      If any threads are created in either of these phases, they're still not
 *      scheduler threads so we don't have to care then either.
