#    77 = R3 erlang node
#   104 = R4 hidden node
#   109 = R4 erlang node
#   (110 = R6 nodes (explicit flags for differences between nodes))

# What epmd has been told, differs very much between versions, both
# 111 and 110 seems to have been used to tell epmd, while
# the actual nodetypes has still been 104 and 109.
# EPMD does not care about this, why we move back to using
# the correct tag (an 'n') for all nodes.

# Lowest/Highest supported version of the distribution protocol:
#   0 = R3
#   1 = R4
#   2 = R5      ?????
#   3 = R5C
#   4 = R6 (development)
#   5 = R6
#   6 = 23
# There was no protocol change in release R5, so we didn't need to raise
# the version number. But now that R5A is released, it's best to keep it
# this way.
# The number was inadvertently raised for R5C, so we increase it again
# for R6.
# Distribution version 4 means a) distributed monitor and b) larger references
# in the distribution format.
# In format 5, nodes can explicitly tell each other which of the above
# mentioned capabilities they can handle.
# Distribution format 5 contains the new md5 based handshake.
# Distribution protocol version 6 introduced in OTP 23 supports 32-bit creation
# values in local node.
