Welcome to Erlang/OTP!

This Erlang installation requires "Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable". Unless it is already
present on your system, you can install vc_redist.exe that is included with this installation.
For scripts, CIs, etc you may want to install it in "passive" mode:

    .\vc_redist.exe /install /quiet /norestart

For an installation that is more integrated with Windows (Adds Erlang to Start menu, Add/Remove
Programs, etc), download a "Windows installer" from https://www.erlang.org/downloads.
