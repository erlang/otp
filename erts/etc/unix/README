Installation
------------

Please refer to the "System Administrator's Guide" for a description
of how to install the Erlang system. Ultra-short summary for the
impatient: Run the 'Install' script in this directory and answer the
questions; defaults (if any) are given in square brackets [] at the
end of each question.

Note that the Install script will terminate if it detects problems -
you will have to correct them and re-run the script. If everything
goes well, the last printout should be:

Erlang installation successfully completed

If it isn't, something went wrong - check the printouts to find out
what it was.

%hpux Note: On HP-UX, it isn't possible to have per-manpage-tree 'whatis'
%hpux files. Thus, 'erl -man -k <subject>' will not work, and it isn't
%hpux recommended to integrate the Erlang man pages into /usr/lib/whatis
%hpux since (as mentioned in the "System Administrator's Guide") there are
%hpux some potential conflicts in naming with standard Unix man pages.
%hpux 
%isc32 Note: The release currently includes several files with names longer
%isc32 than 14 characters - this means that you will have problems unpacking
%isc32 it in a standard Interactive S51K (or S52K) filesystem (which you've
%isc32 probably already noticed...). Furthermore, the Erlang filer makes no
%isc32 attempts to deal "intelligently" with such restrictions. The bottom
%isc32 line is that you have to install the Erlang system in an S5L (or
%isc32 possibly NFS) filesystem, unless you have found a way to make the
%isc32 Interactive system silently truncate filenames longer than 14
%isc32 characters when using S5?K (if so, please tell us about it!).

Overview of the files/directories in the system
-----------------------------------------------

README    - this file.

RELNOTES  - release notes.

Install   - the main installation script.

bin       - the directory where all code that is to be executed
            directly by UNIX is placed during the installation.

lib       - a number of "bundles" included in the release - each
            bundle lives in a subdirectory.  Most of them are written
            entirely in Erlang, but in some cases C programs are also
            used (these are copied to the bin directory during
            installation). The code server will automatically add the
            appropriate directory for each bundle to the search path.
            Some of the more noteworthy bundles:
            std - this is the standard library, with modules such as
            file, io, lists, etc.
            compiler - the Erlang compiler (of course)
            debugger - the Erlang debugger (ditto)
            pxw - the "Primitive X Window interface", which perhaps
            isn't so primitive anymore...
            For further information on these and the other bundles,
            please refer to the man pages.

doc       - The printed documentation in compressed PostScript format,
            and some code examples.

man       - Manual pages, best accessed with 'erl -man' - there are
            some conflicts with standard Unix manpages if you put
            this directory in $MANPATH.

emulator  - The object code for the emulator itself is in the 'obj'
            subdirectory, along with a simple Makefile and a couple
            of source files that advanced users *may* be interested in
            changing - care should be taken, of course, since any
            changes may make the system non-functional. Refer to the
            "System Adminstrator's Guide" and "Additional Features"
            documents for some more information on this.

misc      - Some pieces that don't belong to any particular part of the
            system - e.g. the new erl_interface package, and an Erlang
            mode for emacs.
