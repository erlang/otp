AUTHORS

  Contributions - improvements, fixes, new features - from developers
  make the Erlang 'Open Source' project a success. To give credit
  where it's due, we've added a file called AUTHORS to each
  application sub-directory with a list of everyone who has contributed
  It might also contain the names of the original authors at Ericsson.

  Speaking of original authors, we don't want to forget all the people
  working full time with Erlang and OTP. So, thanks to everyone
  working with Erlang at the OTP group, the Computer Science
  Laboratory and the Software Architecture Laboratory.
